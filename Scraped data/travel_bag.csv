I purchased this bag around the holiday season. I was looking for a bag that specifically has a designated shoe compartment, enough general storage, multiple compartments, and that is an overall aesthetic looking bag. If you are someone that is looking for similar qualities, this is the bag for you.You can expect a durable duffle bag that has more than enough space to store everything you might need for either a weekend away or a trip to the gym. Even with shoes in the shoe compartment, I have been able to fit multiple outfits and miscellaneous objects such as hygiene kits and laptops in the bag without any issues at all.The designated show compartment is amazing. You don‚Äôt have to worry about dirty shoes getting your clothes (or anything else you would carry in your main compartment) dirty. The fact that you can have a separated compartment to put shoes is a major benefit. The compartment is easily big enough to fit 2 pairs of shoes. This is a feature you‚Äôll likely really enjoy.In addition to the shoe compartment and the main compartment, this bag contains several smaller compartments and pockets as well. If you are like me, you prefer to keep smaller items such as phones, wallets, and watches in smaller compartments. This way you don‚Äôt have to dig around the main compartment to find them. This feature will keep everything organized in a convenient way for you.The bag looks like it costs more than the price you will pay for it. Personally, I take the Weekender Overnight Duffel Bag into the office with me every day. It is something I am honestly proud to carry around, and if you get it you will be too. For its incredibly reasonable price, I don‚Äôt think you will get a classier looking bag.Overall, I give this bag 5 stars.

The bottom compartment holds several pairs of shoes- depending on style and size - in my picture are 3 pair of size 9 very shallow shoes- no heel or height.

It does not, the entire bag is soft, including the bottom compartment. I selected the black and leather style ""289""- the black canvas attracted every scrap of lint, duct, or hair and showed terribly. Read the description carefully - there is no wet pocket, and only 1 exterior pocket.Because the base is not rigid and the bag smooshes down on the bottom compartment, and the material collects and shows dirt, I am returning this bag - even though I have to pay $7 for shipping to return.

I got the medium so that it qualified as a ""personal item"" to fit under the airplane seat in front of me. I was particularly interested in the strap that allows you to slip it onto your roller bag\'s handle. I have back issues and carrying around luggage on my shoulders can really aggravate them. After a few tries, I was able to get it on very easily (avoid overpacking the zippered pocket on that side which can make this process much harder).I was VERY impressed by the construction. It seems to be stitched very sturdily and the material is substantial. I believe that it will last for many trips. I also loved the interior. The many net pockets are good sized, capable of holding a water bottle or make-up case easily. The interior zippered pockets are good sized as well but not so big as to loose small items (though they are even more accessible in the smaller outer pockets). The entire bag seems to be made of water repellant fabric (in & out) AND I loved that one of the interior pockets is lined in plastic for ""wet"" items (like a swimsuit). That is were I put my snacks, just in case there was leakage.I only have 2 small complaints; mostly style issues: the front pocket has their logo and it\'s not very attractive. I\'m sure they want the world to know who made it but since it is not a brand anyone would recognize, all it does is advertise that your bag is NOT designer. Wish they had left that off. The other is that there are 2 straps that snap together on each side. I can only guess that they are to create a gathered look when the bag is not stuffed to the max.

Grab two different colors and you‚Äôll know which clothes are yours vs your partner‚Äôs and you can share a suitcase when needed. Tip: Bringing one cube that‚Äôs empty that we can fill with a few things that we need for a one night stay has been a life and back saver. I would invest in 1-3 sets per person (depending on the length of your stays). These don‚Äôt offer compression in the typical way but they do offer maximum safety from elements so if you are setting the cubes down when getting ready things aren‚Äôt getting covered in dog hair or dust as your packing or even when you‚Äôre briefly unpacking in a hotel room and setting your things in a closet or dresser drawer. The large cube is awesome for fitting 2-4 sweatshirts and/or sweatpants (depending on thickness) and it‚Äôs a must-have in my suitcase. I need a cozy set in my suitcase so this helps me bring it. I like having two sets at least per person so I can mix and match what items I have more of and which cubes I don‚Äôt need on a particular trip. It makes putting things in a suitcase take less than 5 minutes which saves buckets of time at the hotel packing up. I also really like the small cube that zips up top and use it for things like underwear, ties, socks‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a really handy cube. I‚Äôd actually love if they sold that one separately so I could buy a few more of that one for various items. I still utilize my delicate bags as storage when traveling to bring along things like pantyhose, pads, the other underwear (women will understand) or even socks if I run out of packing cubes. We like to travel with a weekender that‚Äôs filled with our toiletries, steamer, hair dryer, and other items that could get wet. It helps on those one night stays because we grab our cube that has one night‚Äôs worth of things packed at the previous stop: underwear, socks, pjs, shirt, pants, etc for that night and the next day so we don‚Äôt have to unpack the car. We just grab two items, walk in, take a shower and get ready for bed and go to sleep. Then in the morning we pack up the dirty clothes from the night before in the packing cube and throw it in the hamper we store in the car. Then once we have access to a laundry machine we bring the hamper in and do laundry and we have an organization system ready to accommodate it all again. I hope allThis helps somebody.

Price factors in as it greatly influenced my decision to buy it, and factors in to my recommendation of it. Duffels are not expensive, and this is priced right at sub $20. I bought the multi/pink dot for $17.I love it. I love that it came with tags, so it looks retail. The small brand name patch is subtle and looks good. I appreciate that the name sounds like a real name and not just a string of letters like some stuff have.The size is great! Spacious enough to pack plenty for a trip. I am a light packer, so I never need more than a backpack, but this squared off rectangular size with deep open center compartment is great for stuffing items. Then there are two good sized zippered side pockets (one on each end) that are very functional. Can be packed to the brim with assortment of stuff. The two smaller zippered side pockets on front are good for super small stuff, but not a lot of it. So think pack of gum, lip gloss, pack of tissues, smaller do-dads.Has handles, or can make use of optional, adjustable shoulder strap.FOR ME: I use this as my DAILY CARRY bag. Not exactly as a purse that I go into places with, but it is my bag that has things I may want/need through the day, as well as some emergency items. I like feeling prepared- so I have snacks, water, a small toiletry kit, first aid kit, and some other goodies. I usually have these items in a similarly sized large baggallini purse , but it always feels just a little awkward. Stuff gets packed on top of each other and it becomes cumbersome to access, with little extra room. But with this shape and style, I have more room to situate stuff, yet somehow it isnt really any bigger than the purse I was using. Things (I used smaller zippered bags- like toiletry sized) are side by rather than stacked on each other. Really good for the items I dont access much but want to make sure I have on hand. THEN there is still room on top for quick grab items- things I will most likely use that day. Maybe I tossed a book on top, or a long sleeved shirt, or some lunch, etc. Love my other brand of purse, but currently I am extra happy with using this Rockland duffle.The aspect that really made me love this is that I can use one of the side pockets to store my smaller baggallini crossbody purse (fits perfect in side pocket). I use that when I want to be totally hands free in a store. Then I can stick my phone, note pad, coupons or whatever in it. Or I use that smaller purse when I am visiting people. I want to have some stuff on me (tissues, lotion, lip balm, cough drops, pads, phone, etc) but dont want to bring in a big purse and set it down. I can keep it cross body. Yet, I dont always want this. Often I pop into a store with just my phone. So I want options. This duffle helps me have my options and keeps me organized.Basically goes like this: duffle stuffed with my basic needs and other stuff that makes me feel comfortable to leave the house and take off in my car or someone elses' car (ie emergency goodies). Small cross body purse stuffed into side pocket for quick grab as needed. I will then leave duffle in car and grab the smaller purse for errands, shopping, appts, visiting. Yet,if I want to carry this duffle as a purse, it isnt so big that it would look funny.Worth trying anyway.I havent had it long, so I will report back on its durability as I use it more."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States March 19, 2022', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Good Use for the Gym', 'author': 'JECartwright', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'I purchased this duffel bag on a tight budget based on reviews, and it has held up nicely for a gym bag. The two compartments on each end are deep, have sturdy zippers with convenient pulls and are very handy for shower products and swim goggles. The two small front zipper pockets have the same strong zippers with pulls and work well for smaller things like gym lock and car keys. The main compartment is a nice size and fits my water shoes, towel, and swimsuit easily. There are two short carry straps which I prefer, and one long strap that I unhooked. The bottom of the interior has a covered hard surface to keep the bottom flat and dry. I like the plastic knobs on the bottom that keep the bag from resting flat on a surface though I feel that it could use two more in the center. Storing the bag in a gym locker has been tricky, as it needs to be turned on its side to fit the tall, narrow area. This bag gets a lot of wear, and it has held up well in the 4 months I have used it 3 or 4 times a week.

I have a weird obsession with bags. But, that should also let you know how great this bag is because I go through a lot of bags and there are few that I feel the need to rave about.I use Ikea bags regularly because I love how big and sturdy they are. I use them for everything and bring them everywhere. But... they\'re bright blue, plastic-ish bags. So I was looking for an alternative that would hold a lot of stuff that I could carry here and there. I read the reviews and thought I would check this one out. And, the photos were quite impressive of someone carrying this monstrous thing.When I opened the package I felt this wave of disappointment thinking, ""This isn\'t nearly as big as it looked."" But when I took it out, opened it up, and put some stuff in it... wow! It\'s huge! Then I realized that not only was it huge, but it\'s really well made. It seems really sturdy, it\'s canvas, which I really like, and I\'m already absolutely loving it and planning on how I\'m going to start parting with my 30+ Ikea bags that are all over my house. I plan to buy a couple more of these, so I can keep one in the car and one at my office for comfort reasons and that will let me finally let go of most of these ugly Ikea bags. I can also totally see giving these as gifts because who doesn\'t love a huge tote bag? I mean this thing would come in handy for just about anyone.If I had 2 (tiny) complaints, I would love to see more patterns (I like subdued patterns, like tone on tone paisleys, etc vs. bright patterns) and I would love an outside pocket or 2.

Even though this bag has some issues - see below - it is easily the most comfortable crossbody pack I have ever tried (and I have tried many!)I am 5\' 7"", around 115lbs, and have narrow shoulders and chronic upper back pain. I\'d never really noticed that this thing has padding in the spots that make contact with my shoulder and my back until now. Plus, something about how the weight is distributed with this bag just works well for me. So, yeah. I\'ll probably end up ordering a new one after all. Maybe I can, like, add super glue to the seams around the phone pouch and replace that clip before it breaks next time.Update October 15 2023: They fixed the zipper on the phone pouch but the pouch still fell apart. The plastic clip is also still a problem. (See pics.)I have now purchased this bag 3 times, most recently in December 2022. This is something I\'ve never done with any other bag or purse, but I really like this one and it\'s nearly perfect for hiking with my dog and general everyday use. (I ditched my purse and started just using this bag for everything a while ago!)On the most recent bag, I was impressed that they had reinforced the zipper on the cell phone pouch. That zipper had broken on my previous two bags and other reviewers had reported the same issue. This newly reinforced zipper hasn\'t broken on me yet.However, one of the fabric edges at the bottom of the phone pouch started separating at the seam only a few weeks after I got it and has only gotten worse with time. I\'ve still been using the thing, lol, but at this point it\'s close to being too big to keep my phone from falling out.Now, if I had applied fabric glue or fray check or even just super glue when it first started I probably could have prevented it from getting any worse and it would have looked good as new, but I just never had the time to mess with it. (Plus, I would\'ve had to use a different bag for at least a day while it dried and I honestly couldn\'t be bothered.)In addition, a few days ago the plastic clip that clips the strap onto the bag - the thing that makes it repositionable from one side to the other - popped apart. (The same thing happened on my previous bag as well.) I snapped it back in, but it\'s happened a few more times since then with increasing frequency. Finally, a few days ago it popped apart again on a hike, dumping my bag onto a muddy trail in the middle of a rain storm, so I finally gave in an ordered a different bag. :(Previous review:I bought this in Feb. 2021 to use for daily 3-5mi hikes with my dog. It was so comfy and convenient that it ended up replacing my purse as well, becoming the only bag I\'ve carried until now (July 2022).I love the convenient phone pocket on the strap, the multiple pockets inside the main compartment, the capacity, and the fact that I can switch the strap from left shoulder to right shoulder. I especially love that it has two water bottle pockets on the sides of the bag that easily fit average sized water bottles, allowing me to carry enough water for myself and for my dog in the summer.There are also multiple places to attach a carabiner clip or S-biner to in order to carry a folding water bowl and a poop bag holder for the pup. To top it all off, the strap is wide enough and comfortable enough to make carrying the bag for long distances a breeze.Unfortunately, about 6 weeks ago the cell phone pocket zipper broke. I\'ve actually still been able to use the pocket by tying a broken hair elastic around the it, providing an elastic restraint to hold my Moto Stylus G5 in the pocket -- as long as I don\'t bend over, it stays put.But then, a few days ago, part of the strap clip popped out. It\'s a kind of plastic rod that inserts into a socket and allows the strap to spin around in any direction, making it possible to switch the strap from left shoulder to right shoulder. Anyway, I was able to snap it back in, but it has popped out a few more times since then, and each time the plastic piece that holds the socket together wears down a little more. So, unfortunately, I\'ll need to replace the whole bag very, VERY soon. (Like, now.)That said, other than those two issues, every other part of the bag has held up impressively well. None of the other zippers have broken and there are no tears or rips in any of the seams or fabric. Both water bottle holders are still intact, despite the mesh material. The bag still looks great as well. And I\'m really not exaggerating when I say that I have beat the crap out of this thing.While I hate having to throw yet another mostly intact thing into the garbage (and from there into a landfill ‚òπÔ∏è), for the price I paid for this bag and the amount of wear and tear it survived I think it was definitely worth the money.

This bag attracted me because of the padded laptop sleeve (which the VB bag doesn't have) and which I thought might be handy for weekend trips or as a carry-on. To my delight, my 15.6-inch Samsung laptop fit in just perfectly into the special laptop sleeve, a separate zipped compartment that also includes some space for peripherals (space to stash your wristpad, mouse, cords, etc.) plus some mesh pockets for pens or small notebooks, etc. The main compartment of the Bagsmart bag is comparable to the VB bag. There is a big open space with some mesh pockets on one side and a zippered wet pocket on the other (good space for 3-oz toiletry bag for carry-on situations). The VB bag by contrast has mesh pockets on both sides. The Bagsmart bag is approximately an inch taller and two inches longer, so the overall size / interior space beats the VB bag, without making it a markedly larger bag. It should still fit under an airplane seat. The Bagsmart bag and the VB bag are similar in terms of having a trolley sleeve and a number of zipped or open exterior pockets for stashing boarding passes, small snacks, sunglasses, etc. The Bagsmart bags beats the VB bag in terms of having a stretchy open pocket on either end sizes for drinks, a bottle, or a collapsible umbrella (the VB bag just has one). Oh, and it comes with a little shoe bag (nothing fancy, but a nice touch).Overall, the Bagsmart bag slightly beats the Vera Bradley bag in terms of size (slightly larger), exterior pockets (one more), and the laptop compartment (the biggest plus). The Vera Bradley bag beats the Bagsmart bag in being of noticeably better quality, with nicer fabric, prettier interior design, metal rather than plastic hooks for the shoulder strap, and nicer zipper pulls (though both have very similar, high-quality zippers with a smooth feel). Both bags are pretty--I chose lovely designs that I enjoy looking at for both. I love flowers and paisleys, so it's hard to go wrong with either bag here.In sum, I give the edge to the Bagsmart bag because the laptop compartment is just too great of a feature. It enables me to stow my laptop without requiring any jury-rigging or, even worse, lugging a separate laptop carrier; that's going to be super useful for me, both for car trips and air travel. Although I enjoy the superior quality of the VB bag, the versatility and usefulness of the Bagsmart bag will almost surely cause me to choose it when I'm getting ready to head out. Finally, the fact that the Bagsmart bag is *almost* as pretty as the VB bag--yet costs just a third of the price, or less--means it's the clear winner in terms of affordability and bang for the buck, as well."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 17, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great for carry on bag, fits under airline seat', 'author': 'Michelle A', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I purchases this specifically for airline travel.

I was able to fit my laptop, an additional travel monitor, charging cord, mouse and internet cable in the laptop section. In the other section I put a change of clothes, swimsuit, medications, charging cables, earbuds, tablet, small purse, snacks and water. This bag is well organized with the right amount of pockets. I love how its wider than it is deep. this makes it easier to find stuff. The shoulder strap is comfortable. The back side has a luggage handle strap that you can slide over your roller luggage handle which keeps the bag securely on top of your roller bag while you navigate the airport. I will say this handle strap was a little tight to get over my luggage handle. But that issue is very minor. It has side pockets which are convenient for your water bottle and/or snacks. The zipper pockets on both the front and back are prefect for your phone, passport, boarding pass or other small items you want to access quickly but also keep secure.

I packed a big thick sweater I was already taking w/me in the big compartment facing the computer side that wasn't padded to protect the second laptop but if you are careful with your bag you don't need to even do that.it is shapeless kind of, but oddly that's also why i like it.I don't expect it to last forever but for the price, it's great for travel, overnight or gym use.Zippers are good quality. Fits plenty of stuff for the size too and has elastic pockets on each side for your water bottles. If you need a bag for your personal item to go with your carry-on, this is quite a good option. I opted for this bag on my most recent trip over a larger more expensive personal item /duffle that is quite boxy. I prefer the lack of structure of this bag because you can squeeze it into tight overhead bins or under the airplane's seat that way.The sleeve to secure it over your carry-on handle has a zipper pocket too. I used this quite a bit.if it's not full completely it has no shape though, so it won't sit very elegantly over your suitcase. I don't care but if you do, keep that in mind. otherwise, great purchase for the price. will eventually be a gym bag. i like it for that too.

But first, the POSITIVES: Beautiful color!!! I've always stuck with browns for crossbody and blacks for waist packs. But WOW, this is gorgeous...not obnoxiously bright or loud color by any means. Hardware: all of the hardware from zippers, snaps, the swivel clasp...top notch!!!, Material: nicely weighted, durable, easily cleaned of spills. The pack lining also seems very durable. Compartments: a LOT of compartments in a small print of a bag. Endless assortments of pockets/pouches. There is a good amount of padding between selected areas of separation-very nice addition. I like that the swivel clasp can be attached to the right or left bottom of the bag dependant on left/right handed or if you want the pack on the front or back. I would love to see only 1 mesh pocket rather than 2 on the sides...to have the other a solid pocket would be more privacy functional. But, that's my opinion and not necessarily a negative. I think the front zipper would be better for storage of that pocket if it was either diagonal or horizontal more than 1/2 way up. The snap at the top of the bag that accesses the main compartment would be awesome if it was a magnetic snap instead. I love the pocket immediately behind the snap flap before you access the main compartment. The back zipper is great functioning as a Mock RFID, meaning I always keep my credit cards close to my body with all other items between me and other persons in public. So, I love this pocket! There is TONS of room in the central main compartment with additional separate pockets and it zips close so even if you don't snap the outter flap, your contents will be secure. And lastly for the positives, absolutely love that this bag holds so MUCH without it looking like you're on a 3-day hiking trip...it's lays flat against your body. Now the big negative for me personally: there is a shoulder zip pocket for maybe a cellphone, cigs or the like. To access this comfortably, I MUST wear the pack on the back with the main strap across my chest, meaning if I'm out/about and need to access anything from the main compartment I have to remove the pack. If I wear the pack on the chest area, I can't access my cell phone/cigs or whatnot from the shoulder pocket unless I remove the pack. But, I do like that the strap pocket has a reflective strip on it and it zips closed. And almost forgot, I also love the thick mesh padding on the back and under the strap to obsorb sweat in warmer climates while adding comfort cushioning. Overall: I would buy again.

My use for a backpack travel bag is so I can be hands-free when making my way through transportation terminals, fumbling for tickets, or reaching for handrails. Also, in some countries there are lots of stairs in terminals (particularly subways) and dragging a roller bag up and down them is hardly fun. It should be obvious that someone planning long hikes or carrying lots of specialized equipment should probably use an internal frame backpack. I don‚Äôt expect to walk more than a mile or two at any one time with a bag like this. My travel is rather conventional tourism, and having visited all 50 states and 17 countries on four continents I‚Äôve had a chance to work out a minimalist system that can keep me going through any weather, wet or dry, from about 40¬∞F to over 100¬∞F, and for an indefinite period of time. I do not take a laptop, but an iPod or iPad. Everything fits into this Matein bag and a lumbar pack from Mountainsmith.I‚Äôve previously used a book bag as a travel backpack, but being a top loading bag, digging down into it to get what I need is an inconvenience. When constantly on the move, unpacking for one or two nights is a chore, so a bag like the Matein that opens out like a suitcase is a much more practical choice.I bought this bag along with an eBags Mother Lode as both seemed to be good and I couldn‚Äôt decide just from the online info. Both look to be well made, but I kept the Matein and returned the eBags Mother Lode.The eBags Mother Lode has more padding in the shoulder straps but no padding on the back. The padding on the Matein straps is thinner than the eBag but adequate, and it‚Äôs nice to have some padding at your back so you don‚Äôt get completely poked if you don‚Äôt pack right. The eBags Mother Lode came with a shoulder strap and a waist belt, neither of which I need.The overall fit and finish of this bag is quite nice. All of the walls are padded. The zippers look to be rugged and of good quality. I did not have any problems with snagging when running the zippers around the corners of the bag.There is a strap on the back of the bag to secure it to the handle of a roller bag. The shoulder straps are stowed inside a large pocket that could be used for a laptop; there is no separate laptop compartment. The straps attach at the bottom of the bag with metal clips and rings that are easy to operate, in contrast to the plastic ones on the eBags Mother Lode unit, which I found a little hard to disengage. The Matein straps look to be well attached at the top and the bottom rings are sewn into reinforced triangle-shaped flaps that look like they will take quite a bit of stress.The hand straps at the top and side of the bag aren‚Äôt as well padded as the eBags Mother Lode, but considering that this is supposed to be a backpack, I don‚Äôt have any issue with this; they‚Äôll serve just fine.The product description says there are Velcro compression straps inside the main compartment. This is incorrect (The description may have been corrected by the time you read this.). The retainer system consists of four elastic bands that connect in the middle with a clip. This is the only weakness I found in the bag, and was a disappointment to me, and why my rating is four stars instead of five, as the elastic doesn‚Äôt seem much stronger than that in my Jockey shorts, and doesn‚Äôt look like it will last all that long. But in the event that the elastic fails, the external compression straps will more than likely suffice. By the way, compression straps are important. I once took a trip with a large backpack bag that had none and the bag sagged like a plastic trash bag and the contents sloshed around uncontrollably.The secondary compartment of the Matein has two zippered inner pockets and a couple of smaller ones that would be handy for pens and such. There is a smaller compartment on the back (the angled zipper in the photos) that measures about 9 x 11 inches which would be a good spot for the small liquids and other stuff you‚Äôll have to remove at security screenings.The construction of the bag looks good. All the seams are straight; exposed seams are covered with binding, and I found only one loose thread. The bag came packed in a drawstring bag that I think I‚Äôll take along as a laundry bag. Empty, the Matein bag weighs about 2 1/2 pounds vs. almost 4 for the eBags Mother Lode, although the eBags Mother Lode is slightly larger and has more pockets. (One of the reasons I returned the eBags Mother Lode is that I don‚Äôt like lots of pockets.)This Matein bag is about half the price of the eBags Mother Lode and I am so far quite happy with what I see. When compared to the eBags Mother Lode and another nameless bag I saw in a local department store, this is a good deal. I‚Äôll be traveling with it for about six weeks this summer and if I have anything to add to this when I return, I‚Äôll update then.__________Update:Here‚Äôs a follow-up report. I took the backpack on one domestic trip for a week and an international trip for a month. On this latter trip we moved every two nights, and the trip took us through three countries, four airports, numerous busses, boats, trains, taxis, subways, the legendary Heathrow Terminal 5, and the ultimate travel survival test, the London underground during afternoon rush. The pack survived well. I remain disappointed with the flabby elastic retention straps on the inside, but the exterior ones took over and kept things under control. I‚Äôm a minimalist traveler ‚Äî the pack was roomy enough for all my stuff excepting a few things I carry in a small waist pack. The pack came with a thin bag I used for laundry; and it folds in half easily to be stored in its original box. I have no problem recommending this for anyone needing a carry-on pack and I look forward to using it on future trips', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 28, 2019', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great bag', 'author': 'Gianni', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""Took it on a short work trip and it was exactly what I needed.

The backpack straps are wide and padded and made hiking through my destination city a breeze. The grab handles on the top and side were handy when I was getting thru transportation hubs. The exterior material is sturdy and waterproof, proven as I trudged through a driving rainstorm on the trip. Importantly, I did not feel like I was carrying around a backpack - it has clean lines and no weird misplaced pockets or garish hardware colors. It's minor, but I care out these little aesthetic points! The only down side is just how huge it is - it is tooo easy to overfill this bag and get it unwieldy.

Why? Because if you pack this thing well, it‚Äôs basically a carry-on that fits under the seat.It might be considered a bit small to be the customary carry-on in most parts of the world. I live in Southeast Asia and it‚Äôs ALL about weight. Budget airlines with silly rules. Nine times out of ten, if you‚Äôre at the gate with a rolling carry-on, you‚Äôre going to get targeted for weight (carry on AND personal item can only weigh 7kg or 15 pounds). Scales are everywhere and it‚Äôs a gamble every time. You‚Äôre likely going to get pressured to check the bag because of the age-old excuse of being ‚Äúoverbooked with a full flight.‚Äù The first picture shows the two bags we purchased. My husband‚Äôs blue bag slid his in under the seat sideways (but you can see it eats up the entire space.) I slid mine in bottom first and still had a size-able slot on the side to either stretch my feet or to put a small crossbody pouch. Not really knowing how much space I‚Äôd have on this first use, the third pic shows the little pouch I used. Next flight I‚Äôm going to bring a small crossbody. This bag also gives you the ability to navigate around the unfortunate seat that has the utility box (charging outlet electrical?). Pictures 2 and 3 show the nice ability to use the 4 clips on the sides of the bag to compress the bag itself and the pics also show you that you don‚Äôt have to join the general panic to get in line just to fight for overhead space - it‚Äôs one of the best parts of this bag. Sitting and enjoying my coffee and reading and waiting for the line to go down.The Good:I really like the simple design. Would it be better if it had a water bottle slot on the side? Yeah. It‚Äôd also be nice with a few more mesh pockets inside but these are in no way deal breakers.The Time Will Tell:Aside from my favorite aspect of this bag being the beating the overhead space fight and feeling immune to public panic to board the plane early‚Ä¶ the other features that I love and drew me to the bag were the fact that this can double as a tote bag. That you can tuck the backpack straps, zipped up and hidden away, to avoid all the straps and buckles flying around, and getting them grimy on an airplane floor. Sometimes I just don‚Äôt want to do the backpack thing. But time will tell on the durability aspect of the tote feature. The handles just don‚Äôt feel very sturdy for long periods of use. My black bag arrived with a box cutter slice by the top handle (as other reviewers have experienced). I‚Äôm willing to just hand stitch it and hope it doesn‚Äôt get bigger.

We went through a lot for my fiance\'s new suit (between the cost and many alterations), so I wasn\'t going to risk it (or my dress) getting ruined or lost, so flying out there this bag was a carry-on. Going through the airports, I had it on top of my rather small roller bag via the rear handle ""strap"" and it was great until I actually boarded the flight. This particular plane had narrower aisles, so I had to take the bag off of the roller bag which made it a little awkward to go down the aisle with my roller bag behind me and holding this bag in front of me. As my fiancee only had a small shoulder laptop bag, on the connecting flight he carried this on the plane instead while I managed my roller bag. It fit fine in the overhead compartments, and these were Southwest 737 Max 8\'s. On our return flights I checked the bag as I wasn\'t as worried about the suit as I was on our initial flights (as he likely wont need it again and because if it got lost the airline would have to reimburse us). But as some people complained about the plastic zippers, out of caution I did get some wire-shanked TSA locks and secured the zippers together. As the metal on the zippers isn\'t large enough, I wound the wire through an opening in the well-stitched nylon zipper pulls (with the clips on the end) but I ""double-wrapped"" it to make sure the zippers were held tightly together (if it only went through once there would be a wide gap due to the length of the lock wire). On the side where the top zipper goes across I was able to pull the wire through the end of the metal zipper pull as well, and that one I also wound through twice. I was skeptical that the bag would be able to make it through being tossed around by TSA and other bags being stacked on top of it, so to give it some extra stability I cable tied the handles together to help hold the bag together in case the top zipper started to give. This bag was the first of ours to come off the carousel at baggage claim and I was surprised it was in amazing shape. I was very very impressed. I don\'t know if/when I\'ll need to use this bag again, but I feel confident that it will hold up.

I prefer this clever style way over my ole duffel bag that has a shoe pocket to 'stuff' into the main space.* the shoe compartment is waterproof* bag has a wide slot that fits over a luggage trolley* quick easy to reach outer pockets* several interior pockets! (some bags only have 1)* generously sized to hold more than a weekend of clothes, large toiletry bag and misc. items.* feminine is what I wanted -- and the pink fit the bill for me. It's very pretty and stylish.* oh and the strap needed to be fully adjustable. I did not want a buckle style where the shortening of strap is restricted to those buckle strap holes.* this was the largest I could find that had all the above list of main features that I knew I wanted.Personal preference - I thrive on organizing, so I could use two-three larger interior pockets or even dividers for organizing smaller groups of clothing such as socks for example, so I happily solved how I like to pack, by simply placing those smaller group of clothes in med-large zip lock baggies.I looked high & low for a couple of months for a bag with greatest storage/pockets or dividers.

As someone who is always looking for ways to maximize space and keep my belongings organized, these vacuum bags have proven to be a game-changer.First and foremost, the quality of these bags is outstanding. The durable material and robust zipper ensure that my items are securely sealed and protected from dust, moisture, and insects. I feel confident storing my clothing, bedding, and other textiles knowing that they are safe and well-preserved.The vacuum functionality is where these bags truly shine. With a few simple steps, I was able to remove excess air from the bags, reducing their volume by up to 80%. This not only saved an incredible amount of space in my closets and storage areas but also helped me keep everything neatly organized. The bags are compatible with most vacuum cleaners, making the process quick and effortless.I was pleasantly surprised by the versatility of these bags. Whether I needed to store bulky winter blankets or a collection of out-of-season clothing, the variety of sizes provided in the set accommodated all of my needs. Additionally, the transparent design allowed me to easily identify the contents of each bag without having to open them, which was incredibly convenient.What truly sets these vacuum storage bags apart is their long-term effectiveness. Even after weeks or months in storage, the vacuum seal remained intact, and my items emerged just as fresh and well-preserved as the day I stored them.In conclusion, these vacuum storage bags have exceeded my expectations in every way. They have helped me reclaim valuable space, protect my belongings, and maintain a tidy home.

This made it challenging to secure the bag properly, leading to air leakage and reduced compression.2. *Time-consuming vacuuming:* While the vacuum function effectively removed air from the bags, the process was quite time-consuming, especially for larger items. It required multiple attempts to achieve maximum compression, which was inconvenient and labor-intensive.3. *Limited air retention:* Despite initially achieving a tight seal, I noticed that the bags tended to lose their vacuumed state relatively quickly, sometimes within a day. This meant having to re-vacuum the bags frequently, defeating the purpose of long-term storage.**Overall Impression:**While the vacuum bags offer a convenient solution for maximizing storage space, their performance is hindered by several notable drawbacks. The zipper's lack of durability and the difficulty in maintaining a tight seal diminishes their effectiveness, particularly when storing a large number of items. Despite their shortcomings, the bags may still be suitable for short-term storage or organizing lightweight garments.

They work great and save space and you use less luggage which is great , however after you have unpacked and put the bags away when you need to repack to go home there you are with a pile of bags and unless you lay them all out first it is difficult to know if you are packing the clothes in a bag that is too big for the intended contents or worse too small so you waste time switching items from one bag to another or start all over.

I went searching online for 40 L backpacks to see if they did or did not meet the requirement, and found all sorts of mixed responses. I decided to take a gamble and see if I could get on board with the backpack - regardless of if the backpack satisfied personal item size requirements. The airport that I flew out of did not have a size checker and I got on board no problem. There was one at the arriving airport.The picture attached to this review is the backpack easily fitting inside the personal item size checker. However the bag is not completely filled to its limits either. This is with the extension zipper closed, the 4 side straps pulled tightly, and the bag not too overpacked. Inside the bag is a laptop and some electronics that go with that, five shirts, two pairs of pants, two pairs of shorts, some socks, toiletries, and one pair of shoes. Certainly enough to make it a few days, but not a whole lot extra on board. At this fill, it easily satisfied the personal item requirement. However, with the expansion zipper out, and the bag fully loaded it would not.As far as the bag itself, I am quite happy with it. I liked that the straps could be zipped inside of the bag so that it would look like a regular handled bag if I didn‚Äôt want to go with the backpack look. I feel like it is well-made and should hold up for a while. The backpack straps are comfortable and I like that it had the front latch to hold the straps together. Compartments and zippers are generous. I have not mastered the packing cubes yet, but everything online indicates the packing cubes make life even better in a bag like this. That‚Äôs for future experimentation.Happy with this bag. So much so that we are purchasing another one for my wife, who was jealous as I traveled.

I have had trouble in the past with pickpocketing and am paranoid about having my belongings stolen. The security features are what drew me in on this product and they did not let me down. The security clasps gave me confidence that my wallet was safe in the clasped pocket. The purse itself holds a lot of items and is quite comfortable. I was able to fit my hydroflask water bottle and a foldable rain jacket inside the bigger purse pocket along with a portable phone charger, pocket calendar, tissues, and a few other small items. I can even fit a thin book or journal in this bigger pocket! A small wallet, a checkbook, a passport, and some pens or pencils can fit in the smaller pocket with the card slots. And the front pocket can fit a phone for quick access, or other small items like chapstick or something that is frequently accessed.I was disappointed to discover that the water bottle pocket on the side is not big enough to securely hold a water bottle. A normal sized, disposable bottle may stay well, but anything bigger/taller will be too tall to not fall out. Luckily the inside pocket is big enough to store a bottle. The other side pocket is the perfect size for a pair of sunglasses or a small snack.I will say that the slash-resistant strap, while useful in protecting against an attempt at purse-stealing, can be a bit sharp on the shoulder due to the stiffness of the material. The body of the purse is also water-resistant in the case of rain (at least a light rain, although a heavier rain might seep through more).Overall, I absolutely love this purse and its incredible functionality.

Had an earlier model of the same bag that I used regularly for years, but had to retire it recently after two of the zippers finally gave out. There have been some changes and improvements to the current model being sold. 1) Magnet closure on side pocket replaced with Velcro closure. This is a good improvement as magnets have no place on handbags (and the earlier version erased my bus pass on one occasion). 2) Lobster-claw security clasps have been replaced with rectangular hinge clasps. This is a mixed change. The new clasps are easier to use, but may be slightly less secure. The new clasps are probably less likely to break, but due to how they are attached, they\'d be harder to replace if they do break. 3) Two interior mesh pockets in main compartment have been removed. Generally this is a positive. The mesh tended to catch on things, and there are still two cloth pockets that hold my phone and glasses. This frees up more space in the main compartment. 4) A sturdy ribbon with clasp has been installed in the main compartment -- great for easily finding your keys. 5) Middle wallet compartment now has a interior zip pocket, similar to the larger one in the main compartment. This seems more secure and more functional than the earlier model\'s small open pocket. 6) Credit card slots have been moved to the other side of the middle wallet compartment, outside of the cash pocket. This works fine. 7) Cash pocket is slightly smaller than the one on the earlier model. Works OK for dollars, but might be harder for some foreign currencies or placing a bank envelope. 8) Gusset added to wallet compartment. This makes it easier to open this compartment and access your items. 9) All three zippers seem to have been upgraded to stronger, sturdier ones. Bodes well for preventing the main reason I had to give up my earlier bag!If I could make one suggestion for improving this bag, it would be to re-think the side pockets. The one with the Velcro closure is really too small for securely holding a phone, and the zippered one on the other side, allegedly for holding a water bottle, is really not functional for holding anything other than a mini water bottle, which most people don\'t bother to use or carry in a bag. I think it\'s OK to have at least one side pocket for holding small items you want to access quickly, but I think an open envelope pocket on the back side of the bag, for holding papers or realistically stashing a phone, would be more useful.Although I\'ve made a lot of critiques here, I have to say that I love this bag and do highly recommend it. I originally bought it before travelling abroad, but ended up using it as an ""every day"" bag.

I ended up purchasing a small additional card pocket case separately which I need at home as well as on vacation. Also, I have a little folder for cash since there\'s not a ""dollar size"" pocket specifically. It would be nice if this was attached because there\'s some risk it could fall out if you don\'t zipper up. The velcro for the cell phone pocket on the side also did not work well - it was not sewn on securely enough (I fixed that myself) and it was not sewn on in a way to match up the velcro so that it would latch securely (I thought that was a strange oversight on the part of the person doing the construction).

S. Prakash', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""Recently got back from a trip to Spain and this duffle bag was the best travel hack we've discovered in a while.We normally take one checked luggage and two carry-ons, and a backpack for me and a large purse for my wife. We try to travel relatively light.So this time, I grabbed this folding duffle literally last minute before heading out and tossed it into the checked-luggage suitcase. The duffle bag, when folded, is thin and lightweight, so it doesn't really take up much space in your luggage.On returning from Spain, we stuffed the duffle with our dirty laundry, our puffer jackets, and whatever else that was not too valuable, like non-fragile gifts, casual shoes, and some books. The duffle bag is a good size and the material is sturdy, albeit a little thin. So this is great for stuffing in things like we did, but you are not going to want to use this to carry heavy items or anything of significant value, since it doesn't have much internal structure and therefore won't protect items inside all that well.With the bulky and lightweight stuff removed from our other travel gear and stuffed into this duffle, we were free to do some duty-free gift shopping. We bought a few bottles of expensive Spanish brandy and olive oil and we were able to carry those in our carry-ons instead of lugging them around in those security-sealed bags all day through multiple airports.On returning home, the bag looked great and it seems of good enough quality that it will last at least a few more trips overseas. I'll write an updated review when the bag finally gives out.So far, this is the best $16 I've spent on something that is actually useful for travel.Verdict: Highly Recommended"", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 3, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect for camping', 'author': 'Sarah', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Got this for my son for his first camping trip with the Boy Scouts.

Buy it, In-depth review, It‚Äôs Better Quality than similar bag with more reviews.', 'author': 'jacqueline williams', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'If you‚Äôre on the fence about buying it, jump off! It‚Äôs 100% worth it! Read this before buying the Bolosta weekender bag, skip to the end for my verdict.I have all-cream luggage and I was looking for a cream-colored weekender to complete my set, especially for mini-trips. After surfing the internet, I found two options on Amazon that were most suitable to my needs. They looked so similar that I wasn‚Äôt sure which option to go with. So I decided to buy them both and compare. This review is what I found in my comparison and my opinion on what I think is the better bag. This should help anyone who was stuck between both bags like I was, to make a decision.üòäüòäBrands: I purchased the Bolosta bag ($37) and the Wogarl bag ($44), both cream-colored. The Bolosta bag has way more reviews so it was my first choice in the beginning. I‚Äôm glad I decided to buy both and compare because the differences are astounding!Dimensions: The Wogarl bag‚Äôs dimensions are (L)19.7 x (W)9.8 x (H)14.6 inches and the Bolosta bag‚Äôs dimensions are (L)19 x (W)9.5 x (H)13 inches. This means the Wogarl is the bigger bag.Cream Fabric: The first thing I noticed is that these bags are quite similar at first glance. The cream material on both bags is exactly the same texture, color, and quality. It‚Äôs quite nice and durable. This section is a tie!Leather: The Bolosta bag had a darker brown leather-like material that looks more artificial and cheaper than the leather on the Wogarl bag. The leather on the Wogarl has that aged, hyde look that leather tends to have and looks just like real leather. Wogarl wins this section if you‚Äôre looking for a more quality look.Shoe Compartment: The Wogarl bag has a much bigger shoe compartment than the Bolosta. I could probably fit two small shoes in the Bolosta but fit two large shoes or even three small shoes in the Wogarl. Also, the Wogarl is lined with a thick, silky material as opposed to the thin fabric in the Bolosta. Wogarl wins this section.Leather Strap: The leather straps on both bags are the same length and structure, however I like the Wogarl strap better since the leather material looks more quality. Wogarl wins this section.Zipper and Hardware: The Bolosta zipper is made with the leather material but the seams and thread is coming out so it looks cheap (pic included). The Bolosta hardware has a brushed gold finish. The Wogarl zipper is regular metal but feels durable. The hardware has a brushed steel finish.Front side: The front-sides of the bags are similar. The Bolosta has a plain face with one open pocket compartment. The Wogarl has the brand name etched on a piece of leather on the face of the bag. It also has 2 compartments, an open pocket and a zipped pocket. The space in the open pockets on both bags is the same. Because of the extra pocket the Wogarl has, Wogarl wins this section.Back side: The back-sides of the bags are exactly the same. There is a zipped pocket on both and an open space for a suitcase handle to pass through. The space in the pocket is the same on both bags. It‚Äôs a tie!Handles: The leather handles on the Bolosta are much smaller than the Wogarl. The Wogarl handles are thicker, maybe 2x the size so they feel more quality. Both bag‚Äôs handles have a leather strap that holds the handles together. The Wogarl‚Äôs strap fits tighter and more secure around the handles since the handles are thicker. Wogarl wins this section.Interior Space: The space in these bags are exactly the same. I included a picture where I put my cosmetics bag in both of the bags and you can see that the cosmetics bag takes up the same amount of space in both the Bolosta and the Wogarl. It‚Äôs a tie!Interior Fabric: There is a massive difference. Bolosta has a thin, cheap-looking material üòí but Wogarl has a silky-satiny, soft, thick material with a nice sheen. This material looks and feels quite expensive. Wogarl wins this section.Interior Zip Pocket: The Wogarl has 2 zipped pockets, one lined with waterproof material and one lined with the silky fabric. Bolosta has 1 zipped pocket. Wogarl wins this section.Interior Open Pocket: Both bags have two open pockets but there are some differences. The Bolosta pockets are made with that same thin material but the Wogarl pockets are double-lined with the thick, silky material and also have a leather detail at the edges. Wogarl wins this section.Weight: The Wogarl is so much heavier than the Bolosta bag. This helps because it adds to the quality, expensive look. The Bolosta is quite light. I looked up the weights on the product pages. The Bolosta bag is 2.6lbs but the Wogarl is 2.95lbs. It feels even heavier than that, honestly. Wogarl wins this section.In conclusion, it‚Äôs no doubt that the Wogarl is the better bag. It looks more quality and expensive, it reminds me of my Polo Ralph Lauren bag. It also has more compartments and better looking and better feeling fabrics. The Bolosta in contrast looks and feels so much cheaper. Between both bags, it looks like more thought went into making The Wogarl since the fabrics, structure, size, textures, and features look more expensive than the Bolosta. It looks like it costs three times the price that I paid for it! I‚Äôm gonna go ahead and keep the Wogarl. I‚Äôm not sure why the Bolosta has more reviews, maybe it‚Äôs been on Amazon longer and it‚Äôs $7 cheaper than the Wogarl. But I think over time, people will realize the Wogarl is the better option.

I purchased this bag around the holiday season. I was looking for a bag that specifically has a designated shoe compartment, enough general storage, multiple compartments, and that is an overall aesthetic looking bag. If you are someone that is looking for similar qualities, this is the bag for you.You can expect a durable duffle bag that has more than enough space to store everything you might need for either a weekend away or a trip to the gym. Even with shoes in the shoe compartment, I have been able to fit multiple outfits and miscellaneous objects such as hygiene kits and laptops in the bag without any issues at all.The designated show compartment is amazing. You don‚Äôt have to worry about dirty shoes getting your clothes (or anything else you would carry in your main compartment) dirty. The fact that you can have a separated compartment to put shoes is a major benefit. The compartment is easily big enough to fit 2 pairs of shoes. This is a feature you‚Äôll likely really enjoy.In addition to the shoe compartment and the main compartment, this bag contains several smaller compartments and pockets as well. If you are like me, you prefer to keep smaller items such as phones, wallets, and watches in smaller compartments. This way you don‚Äôt have to dig around the main compartment to find them.

I needed to replace my personal item bag, and wanted something that is roomy but not too bulky, and can still fit under the seat. I also don't want to cause a gate agent to eye me up and ask me about the size of my bag.The sides of the zipper on this bag snap down, so it makes the bag somewhat shorter when fully zipped. This lowers the overall profile 'look' of the bag and is great when boarding a flight. Regardless of the configuration, the bag easily fits under a the seat in front of you. I don't stuff it completely full and tight, so there's that. I use it for laptop, books, travel essentials like chargers, cords, and a change of clothes and toiletries - and the random item that doesn't fit into my backpack, like a jacket or extra pair of shoes.I like the outer zipper pocket, it is a really nice size for chargers, cords, and earbuds that I want to use on the flight and need to access easily. The inner pocket is a good size as well.The bag is not structured, so it will confirm to whatever you put inside of it. If you don't stuff it to capacity, it is a great size for under the seat. I am not sure it would fit under the seat if stuffed to capacity, but would definitely go easily into the overhead bin. It is a big bag, and with no real structure, it can hold a lot of stuff. It could probably be a main travel bag if only traveling for 3-4 days.The shoulder straps are good, and I like that it has a cross body strap. This comes in handy when I'm walking distances through the airport or to and from trains, hotels, etc. I use the shoulder straps when boarding planes because it helps to lower the profile look of the bag.There are a few other bells and whistles on this bag that are nice, but I probably won't use, such as the yoga mat strap, and other internal straps in pockets for water bottles and other things."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 2, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Best travel bag', 'author': 'Marisa', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""Bought this bag mostly for traveling.

Its spacious design has allowed me to pack more than anticipated, although, on occasion, I overpacked and feel the weight on my back. Nevertheless, I adore how the main compartment opens fully, allowing for efficient packing and utilizing every inch of space. The multiple pockets in the front compartments prove invaluable for organizing my essentials, while the dedicated back compartment securely accommodates my laptop, cords, and other electronic devices. Additionally, for a fairly inexpensive backpack, the quality is quite nice. I have been on multiple trips, domestic and overseas, and I\'ve seen no fraying or ripping and the zippers are still intact.While the LOVEVOOK meets most of my needs, there are a couple of minor functionality issues that could be improved upon. Firstly, when the main compartment is packed to capacity, it can put pressure on the exterior water bottle pouch, necessitating a thinner bottle. A slightly larger pouch with more elasticity would accommodate larger bottles more comfortably. Secondly, while including a luggage strap is convenient, its placement low on the backpack can cause imbalance when attached to luggage handles, especially when fully loaded. Adding a second luggage strap would enhance stability and prevent the backpack from leaning forward or slipping to the side when attached to luggage.Despite these minor issues, I\'m thoroughly impressed with the LOVEVOOK\'s functionality and design, making it an excellent choice for any traveler.""', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 19, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars This travel backpack is Awesome!', 'author': 'Chris Barker', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""The product looks exactly how the photos portray.

I‚Äôve only used it once so far and packed it to the max and it held up super well. I like the backpack idea because I used to use a one shoulder bag and it would be painful to carry. I‚Äôve used regular backpacks but I hate I have to take everything out to get to the bottom stuff.I just got back from a 4 day trip. I packed 2 pairs of jeans, pair of jean shorts, 2 leggings, 9 shirts, a sweatshirt, 2 bathing suits, a coverup, 2 pairs of undergarments, 2 bras, 3 ankle socks, a set of thick socks, a pair of thick sandals, makeup, toothbrush, deodorant, my iPad and kindle, chargers, and a few Knick knack things in the front pocket. I was even able to add a few extra things from the airport and trip itself for the trip home.It was a bit heavy but that was on me - I like having options! It fit under the seat in front of me but does stick out a bit but no issues from Allegiant as being my personal bag. My little purse could have possibly fit but I never tried. I just tucked it under my jacket and didn‚Äôt have any issue there either.It was easy to carry with the straps and it wasn‚Äôt hot for me like others have mentioned. I liked that it has carrying handles on the top and one on the side. I didn‚Äôt use the water bottle holder as once I filled the bag, one wouldn‚Äôt fit. Maybe could benefit making it a stretchy bottle holder, but not a problem for me this go round as it was a quick flight.I really liked the area for the electronics and clothes as those compartments open all the way. This make it convenient to grab your electronics for TSA and to pack/unpack your clothes or just to grab something from the bottom without having to take everything out. The strap to hold clothes in is a great feature too. The packing bags included really helped with compacting clothes (I rolled up my tops into one and my shorts and leggings into another).The stitching and material seem durable. The shoulder straps are cushioned. I also like there are side buckles to help compact the bag and I think it helps not cause so much strain on the zipper but again, I packed a lot and it held up great.I chose this bag over others because it seemed like all of pockets are very spacious - I can confirm, including the two ‚Äúsmaller‚Äù front ones.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 5, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Does it‚Äôs job as advertised', 'author': 'Nicole Renee', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'I‚Äôve been traveling non-stop with this bag for over a month.

Even with a few of the others, I ended up setting my feet on top of the backpack a little.Back pocket:I use an iPad Air and it barely takes up any space. Other than that and it‚Äôs charging cable, I‚Äôve left that pocket relatively empty.Main pocket:I‚Äôve successfully been able to pack 5 days worth of clothing into it: 4 pairs of jeans, 1 pair of leggings, 5 shirts, 5 pairs of socks, 5 bras, and 6 pairs of underwear. Mind you, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù, 200lbs, and a 38DDD, so if you‚Äôre smaller you may be able to fit more.The wet pouch fits all of my bathroom stuff: 6 silicone travel containers, 1 3.2oz glass serum bottle, travel toothpaste, 3.2oz spray bottle, deodorant, and makeup (foundation, contour/concealer, blush, highlighter, small eyeshadow pallet, 3 brushes, eyelash curler, mascara, and setting spray).Large front pocket:This is where I store my hairbrush, comb, toothbrush, planner, pens, 2 charging cables: 1 ten ft and 1 six ft + cubes, chunky solar battery charger, etape, and feminine products with room to spare.Small front pocket:Headphones and walletEven with all of this stuff, there‚Äôs room to spare in the back and large front pockets as most of my stuff fits well in the mid pocket. I love that it opens all the way up so I have easy access to the aforementioned things. Though I will say that the straps on the sides don‚Äôt do much. The tension releases the moment you pick up the bag, but I suppose it would be helpful for keeping most items in place if the zipper happened to burst. I did learn that I needed to be more gentle with the zippers on this bag than I would be with say, a Swiss brand backpack. Do not overfill.The side pouch isn‚Äôt good for much other than maybe a phone or small wallet. I really wish it had some stretchiness so I could fit a water bottle in there.

This one is much roomier and has so many pockets and it fits perfectly under an airplane seat with room leftover!. The previous backpack I used was a lot heavier too even without anything in it.There's a laptop sleeve and a compartment for shoes which is a huge plus. FYI if you use the shoe compartment, there will be less room in the backpack. The water bottle holder is tiny as I couldn't fit a slim water bottle in it so I just used it as another pocket.You can even plug in a portable charger to the backpack. I connected a portable charger in the inside of the backpack and was able to connect a USB-A charging cable in the port on the outside of the backpack to charge my phone with easy access without having to take the portable charger out. You cannot use a USB-C cable with this backpack (USB-A ports only)! Make sure the portable charger also has a USB-A input to connect to the backpack.I haven't tested out the water resistance with the material on the backpack yet but I think the material is pretty durable.

Fits under the seat. The suitcase configuration is nice & the wet pocket is a nice addition. Found the backpack comfortable and aesthetically pleasing. However; the shoe pocket can really only be used with sandals or if the main compartment is nearly empty. I love the color (I got peacock blue) and the material feels a bit hydrophobic, so it‚Äôs easy to wipe down. I haven‚Äôt put it in the washing mashing but a friend confirmed that the USB port was still functional after the backpack was washed. I also appreciated the padding on the back and the ‚Äúsecret‚Äù compartment against the back to prevent passport theft.If you travel frequently you might want to go with something higher quality. But this pack is good for the price.This backpack would be a lot better if it included:Higher quality straps. The straps look and feel a bit cheap. The stitching does not appear too sturdy and will definitely begin to separate quickly with consistent use. I used mine once; and it already started fraying. A handle on the side of the bag, allowing for it to be carried briefcase style and a larger (or maybe two?) water bottle sleeves would be great.A loop or two for hanging keychains on the outside of the back. Doesn‚Äôt seem important until you need a place to hang a hat or a neck pillow.Most importantly this backpack needs a better configuration for the laptop pouch & the two slim front most pockets.The laptop compartment doesn‚Äôt have a sleeve or strap, it‚Äôs just one slim pocket. That isn‚Äôt a big deal, but it would be nice if the laptop pocket could be opened suitcase style for TSA/customs purposes. If the laptop pocket had a clear sleeve / Velcro strap like most backpacks & if the pocket could be opened full length, you would not need to remove the electronics from the backpack.Finally, the most inconvenient feature on this backpack is the complete lack of quick access pockets. There is literally not a single pocket you can easily drop your phone or wallet into. If the front of the backpack had a full access arched zipper pocket, even if it was super thing it would be SO helpful. A few mesh organization pockets (like in the main compartment) and an attached key ring inside the front most pouch would go a long way.So overall, get this backpack for casual travel as a budget option. But the lack of accessibility definitely makes it incompatible with daily use.

We try to travel relatively light.So this time, I grabbed this folding duffle literally last minute before heading out and tossed it into the checked-luggage suitcase. The duffle bag, when folded, is thin and lightweight, so it doesn't really take up much space in your luggage.On returning from Spain, we stuffed the duffle with our dirty laundry, our puffer jackets, and whatever else that was not too valuable, like non-fragile gifts, casual shoes, and some books. The duffle bag is a good size and the material is sturdy, albeit a little thin. So this is great for stuffing in things like we did, but you are not going to want to use this to carry heavy items or anything of significant value, since it doesn't have much internal structure and therefore won't protect items inside all that well.With the bulky and lightweight stuff removed from our other travel gear and stuffed into this duffle, we were free to do some duty-free gift shopping. We bought a few bottles of expensive Spanish brandy and olive oil and we were able to carry those in our carry-ons instead of lugging them around in those security-sealed bags all day through multiple airports.On returning home, the bag looked great and it seems of good enough quality that it will last at least a few more trips overseas.

I have a separate small bag for makeup removers, creams, etc. ‚Äì gotta keep those skincare routines on track!Durable & Stylish:The waterproof material is a lifesaver for any spills or leaks (we've all been there!), and the bag itself is sturdy and well-made. It comes in a range of stylish colors too, so you can find one that matches your travel aesthetic.The Verdict:If you're looking for a travel toiletry bag that's spacious, organized, and makes mornings infinitely more manageable, look no further than the OlarHike Travel Toiletry Hanging Bag. It's saved my sanity (and counter space)."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 28, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Conveniently keeps items separated', 'author': 'PKpharmd', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I haven‚Äôt used this product yet, but looks nice and sturdy-material and zipper wise.

The net pockets or the slip in pocket will hold a really large cellphone if you are one of those people who hates having to dig for your phone.A spare loop to hang keys or hand sanitizer near the top would have been handy.

The snaps came unsnapped right away when I used the bag straps, so that was a worthless feature. I think a loop button feature would hold better for that purpose.There are 3 pockets on the front. I had a water bottle in one (will hold a plastic 16.9 oz. bottle--probably not the wider reusable bottles, though), my book, small magazines, and such in the middle, and gum/candy in the other pouch.The best part, though, is in the back. Yes, that gap was wide enough that I could easily fit the bag onto the carry handle of my suitcases (both my smaller hardside carry on and my larger suitcase). I love that! The zipper pouch is big enough for a passport. I did have a few other flat items in it, but don\'t overstuff it. The passport will fit easily, but should go in first, as the outer edge with the zipper will partially cover it before you zip it closed.I noticed one reviewer complained that it didn\'t work with their bag--but they were using a very soft-sided bag under it. If you are going to stuff this bag, it will work best on a sturdy piece of luggage (hard or soft-side)--not a ""mushier"" soft bag.That said: with this bag (which was well stuffed, mind you), it did sometimes make my carry-on bag tip over if I wasn\'t careful, and the 4 wheels of my carryon didn\'t run as smoothly. I just used 2 wheels when moving at a clip, and that was fine.The bag did really well and still looks great.

I have a hospital trip coming up soon that I needed to pack for a couple days. I love the neutral color and very lovely design of the sturdy material. This bag is heavy duty and waterproof lined. Lots of zippered pockets on the outside; a couple pockets on the inside for phone and maybe a comb and small mirror; and a long deep zippered pocket. Storing shoes, or anything you want, in the zippered base is extra nice. It has double handles with an attached band to snap them together, and also a clip on padded shoulder strap. It did come with a ""purse"", but it\'s not very expandable so nothing bulky could really be carried (like my wallet full of cards: id, medical, credit, debit, and gift). It could be used instead as a toiletry bag for the weekend to hold smallish sizes of toiletry items. It does come with another small bag that could hold some small cosmetic items like lipsticks, eyeliners, foundation, powder, blush, etc. For a weekend you\'ll be packing economically anyway. The construction and stitching is very attractive and neatly done. I sew and make things myself so I am very critical of the construction and detailing of made items. The zippers are sturdy, in gold to match their inconspicuous stitched logo. All the other hardware of clips, rings, buckles, etc. are a very sturdy and heavy chrome metal. It just has a classy and understated but feminine look. I will get a lot of use out of this. It also came extremely well packaged: the bag in it\'s own see through heavy plastic bag, covered in a padded covering, and placed in a gift presentation box.

While this bag is perfect for travel and carrying the necessities you would need for all kinds of trips (up to a week-long)- it is also the perfect craft bag.One of the reasons I say this is because of how it looks- to me when I saw it- it looked like a craft bag because of the colors.The neutrality of the green and how it\'s bright but not too bright- just says ""crafting"" to me. And it\'s a perfect combination with the cream.This bag comes with a zipper along the bottom and when you unzip it you have almost double the space you had before you unzipped it. The depth of this bag seems unending.... So while this bag is perfect for an overnight trip- when you have a weekend or weekly trip- you unzip the bottom and have tons of room!Of course, storing arts and crafts and transporting them- I have unzipped the bottom of the bag and left it that way for quite some time. But, I am making my way through many of the projects that I store there, so when I have less, I plan to zip up the bottom- and make the bag smaller. Bags like this are great because they are easier to store- as they get smaller when you need them to.I love how the carry straps look (shiny) and feel (smooth)- they make this bag easy to transport. I think another reason why I chose to use this as a crafting bag was because it didn\'t come with a shoulder strap. So this is not going to be a bag you want to lug around for hours or hours (unless you can handle bags like that well- lucky you ;)- because, remember, you only have the hand straps. However, depending on how much you have in the bag, the hand straps are long enough that you can carry the bag on your shoulder.Inside there is a padded separator where you can store a laptop or tablet- however please know that I don\'t believe it can fit over something that has a screen bigger than 12 inches- my 11.6-inch screen laptop fits inside but with very little room to spare. On the opposite side, inside the bag, there is a zippered pocket.The front and back of the bag also have zippered pockets which I love- and also on the front, on each side of the zippered pockets are open pockets where you can store things you need to get quickly. That means on each side I can store a paperback but anything bigger- won\'t likely fit there. I do put my cell phone there often (to get to it quickly) as the pockets are pretty deep.A note on the photos I attached with my review- I had used this bag for a month when the photos were taken- so please know there is a little wear and tear on it (and it looks like it was photographed on Amazon when it arrives to you).

It\'s almost like a blue/grey. I wasn\'t entirely sure if I\'d like the white (which is actually cream) part on top but its actually stylish and doesn\'t stick out as much as I worried.The thing I like most about this bag is its zippers, which are very high quality and not at all cheap as some other, similarly priced bags I\'ve seen. Also, the handles on the bag are decent length, where you would be able to carry it over one arm without any issue even when completely full (also not common in similarly priced bags). The last thing that sets this bag apart from others is its fabric, which is not ""shiny"" or cheap looking like I worried. It\'s not terribly thick, but its at least double-lined, and I think this will last.Now for the areas that it could improve:The inside has a zippered compartment, and two ""cubby"" compartments right below the zipper that are not zipped. If you put something inside both the zipped compartment and the cubbies, I\'m not sure much would be able to fit into either, since they overlap within the bag. On the other side of the inside, there is a little pouch but it just includes a simple single velcro across its middle - obviously this won\'t keep anything from falling out (although the velcro is also good quality and not at all flimsy). I wish they had just had one size with a zipper and the other size with the cubbies/velco. Finally, the openings on the outside front, which thankfully do fit my 1-L reusable size water bottle, should be directly on the side as opposed to the front. This makes it a bit awkward to carry the bottle, and almost impossible to shove the bottle in if the bag is completely full.

I‚Äôm not sure I would put anything *actually* wet in the ‚Äúwet‚Äù zip pouch inside, as the lining is the same material as the rest and not especially thick or waterproof seeming, but I‚Äôd probably put toiletries in there and feel okay. Laptop slot is a good size.This is a ‚ÄúFoldies‚Äù dupe type bag, except it does not actually fold up. There is also no cross body strap, just over-the-shoulder straps, though they seem strong and comfy. There are buttons on the top sides as if to help with folding, but as far as I can tell they don‚Äôt have a function.There is a bit of a plasticky smell upon opening, which I hope will dissipate over time.Overall it seems like a good bag for traveling, but perhaps not the most durable in the world.

I have had quite a few laptop bags and backpacks and finally, someone designed one to my specifications! It is not too heavy, it is constructed very well and it is attractive. I was absolutely thrilled that the main compartment had the zipper only at top keeping contents from dribbling out the sides. The opening is adequately large to easily access your belongings. Other cases I have owned had zippers all around the perimeter. It has caused items to dribble out and in one case, the zipper busted and my laptop was damaged. In contrast The Vankean backpack keeps your items secure.The backpack also has sturdy handles at the top which make it so much easier to grab. Having a little experience lugging around a laptop, it is a hidden game changer. I also like the ease of securing the laptop vertically. I put a cushy sleeve on my 15.6 and it fit perfectly fine in the sleeve. There are just two pockets for a laptop and tablet plus a zippered compartment inside. There is also a small pocket for putting charger battery. For the inside, that‚Äôs it. Limiting the compartments make it more useable. If you want to keep things neat, use packing cubes for chargers or personal items.Other than that, I loaded my laptop, Ipad and stuffed a few more things in it and was quite happy that it was easy to use, easy to throw on my back and easy to access items. I could even fit my large cup in the side compartment.Finally, I chose the rose color which is really attractive. I‚Äôve always had dark laptop cases, so it is a really nice change.All in all, I highly recommend it. It is great for day to day use, student use and perfect for carryon.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîUpdate 10/4: I took it on a trip with me and it was perfect carryon for my laptop. I did kinda overstuff it a bit coming back. But I had two laptop sleeves which added a little bulk. For me, a med size tote bag that zipped up would have been a good companion to it. But back to the backback, I was very pleased at the protection it provided.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 5, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing backpack!

I didn\'t need the XL, because I didn\'t take bulky sweaters or jackets. I also didn\'t use the shoe bag because I like to wrap my shoes individually. And, because I took 7 pairs, including 2 sets of heels, so it wasn\'t practical bc they didn\'t fit and I didn\'t want the flip flops all over my white sneakers. The pics show my stuff when we got back. I wish I would have taken pics before we left to show how perfectly neat these cubes held all my clothes. In the pics, the L bag is half empty, so I rolled it up to position it next to the other 2 cubes on the trip home. The laundry bag is big enough to hold 9 changes of clothes (no jeans, but 1 jean shorts). So, what you see next to the empty pink bag was everything else that fit in the 3 half empty cubes in the suit case. The suit case is 27"" long, 18"" wide and 10"" deep. When the cubes are full, they are pretty heavy, approx 5 to 10 lbs, depending on the size of the cube. I will never travel w/o these cubes. My clothes were organized and stayed exactly how I packed them. And, when 1 of our suitcases got too heavy, it was sooo easy to transfer the cubes around between the 2 big suit cases and 2 carry-ons. Last year, we went to Cancun with the kids, before we bought a suit case weighing device, we had to open all of our suitcases in the middle of the PACKED airport, trying to shift the weight around between 6 suitcases, grabbing random clothes. There were underwear flying around all over the place! It was awful! Now, all we have to do is weigh, rearrange if necessary, and go. Now, at the hotel, the cubes went into the drawers and my clean clothes never touched the hotel drawers. So, when I got home, the unused clothes were completely separate from the used clothes, they were perfectly clean and I didn\'t have to wash EVERYTHING (used & unused, like I usually do). My husband didn\'t want to use all of the cubes when we were packing.

BUT, I am fully satisfied with these bags. They compress clothes dramatically, and they don‚Äôt leak air so the vacuum holds.....clothes stay compressed until you open the seal. To get best results, fold clothes neatly before compressing, to avoid bunching up of fabric. This reduces wrinkles and maximizes saved space. Another tip is that first use of a bag takes a bit more force than I expected in order to push the air out. I was worried that I might blow out the seals, but persisted and quickly evacuated the air from the bag. To get The most compression, I roll the bag while sitting on it - this forces out most of the air . I‚Äôve used these on 3 major trips over 6 months, so even with re-use they continue to perforum flawlessly. You can‚Äôt beleive how much volume you can save, which means more stuff you can take with you. Another benefit I found is that if you‚Äôre digging around for something in your packed bag the storage bags are easily moved or removed without turning your bag contents into a shambles. I find that my clothes are less wrinkled, and since they‚Äôre sealed in plastic they are protected from leaking shampoo bottles, and odors from other items packed in the same suitcase!You‚Äôre gonna love these vacuum bags as much as I do.

It fits everything we need with some room to spare- all his sparring gear (helmet, foot pads and hand pads) plus his 2nd gi for his jui jitsu class (which is quite large and a super thick material) that he does right after his karate class in the main large compartment (or a kitty with tons of space to spare lol), plus drinks (2 on outside of bag in the dual bottle holder pockets, plus xtra inside the bag), plus he can fit his shoes in the side shoe pocket when he takes them off, the front pocket holds his sweat band with room for other random smaller items, and there's even a small pocket inside the large main part of the bag that we use for his mouth guard (which would also b good for keys and maybe a phone depending on how large your phone is, but there's always that front pocket that is plenty big enough for phones n such too), there's also another zipper pocket on the side with the water bottle holders (that we currently don't even need to use, but I'm glad to have it, I was hoping that this bag didn't only have a zippered pocket on one side- the shoe side- and I couldn't tell from the listing and pics if the other side had a zippered pocket as well, since it had the bottle holders there- but it does, yay) so this bag really utilizes space well with pockets everywhere u need and want them to b, there's no wasted opportunities here!!...there's plenty of pockets and plenty of space for everything he needs and then some, we really could pack more stuff into it if we needed to, but it isn't sooo much extra space that it's too much ya know..it really is the perfect bag, I could see this bag being useful for so many things, and next time we take our yearly trip back home to FL for a cpl wks, we will be using this bag as his luggage for his stuff and I'm confident it will be the perfect size for holding all his things needed for the trip no problem (and I'll get to use that extra side pocket for sure, sweet)!!-The ONLY thing that might make this bag even better, is if it had a hard insert for the bottom (tho it DOES have a thicker PADDED bottom, so it is actually much thicker than the rest of the bag materials, so it not being a 'hard' bottom doesn't actually matter much, actually maybe this is better than the typical 'hard' bottom, cuz it does enable him to squeeze it into the cubbies at the dojo) either way I'm still super happy with this bag, that's just a small note to make..*If my review was helpful/informative for u, please hit the 'helpful' button below, thanks*"", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 4, 2022', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great duffle bag holds all my sporting equipment perfectly', 'author': 'Doug B', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I play broomball two to three times a month and used to keep all of my equipment in a regular hockey bag which was way too big.

After looking at several similar bags, I selected this Under Armour bag and am very happy with my choice.This bag fits two pairs of knee pads, my helmet, gloves, shoes, and two bags of miscellaneous equipment all nice and tidy in the main compartment. My old bag was about a foot wider and all of the equipment would slide all over the place in the extra space. One of the sides holds a t-shirt, pair of shorts, and pair of socks for after the game. The other side holds a pair of sandals and a few other miscellaneous items. The one feature I really like is the little key pouch on the top inside middle of the bag for keys. With my old bag I would just throw them in the main compartment or one of the sides and I'd always have to go fishing around for them after the game. Now I always know exactly where they are and can quickly get to them. There is another zippered compartment on the front which I don't even use, but is available to hold even more stuff.I like using the padded shoulder strap to carry the bag around so my hands are free, but I do use the traditional two handles periodically when moving the bag short distances.

Here is a winner!', 'author': 'DiscerningConsumer', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""Got this right before leaving overseas. I had it loaded enough it wasn't going to fit under the seat, but probably could have if I'd not absolutely filled it. There are many manufacturers of these type of travel backpacks. I was looking for a very rectangular one without pockets that would be useless to me. I already owned several regular backpacks and wanted one that would fully open and allow easy access for clothes, shoes, toiletries, and electronics while on the go. The shoulder straps were ample and could be hidden away if you were using it as a suitcase. The strap across the back worked well to secure the backpack to my suitcase handle. One slender full length compartment was generous to accommodate a fleece jacket folded up. (Also could serve as a wet container, if needed) Another slot stowed a laptop, located against the back, with lots and lots of padding. Another area held folders of information. Also there were small envelope sized compartments. I actually used the plastic rectangular containers that came with the backpack. I should mention that the bag was tightly wrapped up and had a very strong odor. I left it fully open and didn't notice it after a day, which I was relieved to find. There are straps inside to secure the load if it isn't large enough and there are straps on the outside that cinch down the load to make it look smaller. One bottle holder on the side. Nice handles on top and side making it easy to grab. The exterior material was substantial. Laptop at the back allows better balance. There is also a zipper to expand the bag, although I really didn't use it except briefly. An extra inch or so? A sister had a smaller bag and that fit easily under the seat. If I had required it to get under I would have had to squash the bag down some. But for day to day it was great. Zippers worked easily and none of that digging through a backpack that didn't open all the way to the bottom. Nice that several other slots also opened fully. Main considerations are size needs and exactly what you will want: more or fewer pockets on the outside, more or less rectangular. While not so delightful a color, black is impervious to travel schmutz. Did wipe up nicely after I had to keep my feet on it in the car. Wish I had discovered this model sooner.

Unfortunately, because the sides weren\'t rigid, we ovefilled them. We put a little from each bag into our checked bag and it cost us $240 extra. I bought this bag hoping I never run into that problem again. If you are buying it to use as your free personal item (not as a $65 carry-on item), I think you should be OK. I would give you this word of warning. They are not firm sides and top. They are flexible but with an obvious form. Don\'t over pack the bag. The bags have to go into a ""personal item"" box, freely. Meaning you can\'t push on it to get it in the box. What I like about this bag is that it is 16"", and if you keep the extender zipper closed, it is only 6"" (rather than 7.9"" which I feel might be cutting it a bit close). I plan to keep that zipper closed to that to be on the safe side. The last dimension is under the required size too. The total size is supposed to be no more than 18""x14""√ó8"". With this bag I\'m shooting for safely under, but good sized, rather than those exact dimensions. This bag arrives rolled up and very compressed. It took a little maneuvering to get it into shape. It\'s nice that it came with the 2 see-through toiletry bags. I used a few items in the pictures to show relative size. Those are a large size cooler ice pack, a pack of makeup wipes, makeup brush, and roku remote. The picture with the water bottle shows a heavy, metal, good size bottle, and it could still fit a larger one. If you tip the bag upside down, the bottle would definitely fall out, but I love that it will fit a big one. Another picture shows the pouch for the backpack straps. Tucking in the straps can only help with the box at the airline, so I really like that feature as well. I wouldn\'t call the color beige. It\'s an off white.

I purchased this bag around the holiday season. I was looking for a bag that specifically has a designated shoe compartment, enough general storage, multiple compartments, and that is an overall aesthetic looking bag. If you are someone that is looking for similar qualities, this is the bag for you.You can expect a durable duffle bag that has more than enough space to store everything you might need for either a weekend away or a trip to the gym. Even with shoes in the shoe compartment, I have been able to fit multiple outfits and miscellaneous objects such as hygiene kits and laptops in the bag without any issues at all.The designated show compartment is amazing. You don‚Äôt have to worry about dirty shoes getting your clothes (or anything else you would carry in your main compartment) dirty. The fact that you can have a separated compartment to put shoes is a major benefit. The compartment is easily big enough to fit 2 pairs of shoes. This is a feature you‚Äôll likely really enjoy.In addition to the shoe compartment and the main compartment, this bag contains several smaller compartments and pockets as well. If you are like me, you prefer to keep smaller items such as phones, wallets, and watches in smaller compartments. This way you don‚Äôt have to dig around the main compartment to find them. This feature will keep everything organized in a convenient way for you.The bag looks like it costs more than the price you will pay for it. Personally, I take the Weekender Overnight Duffel Bag into the office with me every day. It is something I am honestly proud to carry around, and if you get it you will be too. For its incredibly reasonable price, I don‚Äôt think you will get a classier looking bag.Overall, I give this bag 5 stars.

Read the description carefully - there is no wet pocket, and only 1 exterior pocket.Because the base is not rigid and the bag smooshes down on the bottom compartment, and the material collects and shows dirt, I am returning this bag - even though I have to pay $7 for shipping to return.

It is made of a light, soft, washable fabric that I feel comfortable carrying around since it has an attractive appearance. I love the divided compartment inside to keep the shoes from scuffing each other. The bag is just the right size...not too big and not too small - perfect for carrying my dress shoes to work in bad weather.NOT SO POSITIVE: The bags I received were GRAY in color, and not tan as the picture shows. It was a great value to receive a set of 2 of these bags for the price, but I have a feeling having an extra bag is a good idea since the fabric may pill, get matted down, and show wear after a period of time or after washings. I would not put wet or muddy shoes in the bag, since the moisture will seep through the fabric (there is no waterproof lining).

I usually put my shoes in whatever plastic bag happens to be at hand before placing them in my suitcase. Who knew that I was in essence proclaiming myself the 'country cousin' by not owning, and using, this essential class of travel product.All kidding aside though, this product works a lot better than plastic bags. First, there are two compartments in each bag which keeps the shoes from scuffing each other. Also, the soft texture of the bag provides a great tool for quickly buffing shoes before leaving the hotel. They fit my size 9.5 shoes perfectly though I would worry about shoes larger than 10 or 10.5.This brand and model is significantly cheaper than others sold on Amazon and elsewhere and do the job they are intended for.

They do squish your items down better than leaving everything ""loose"" (whether folded or rolled) in your suitcase. Everything stays organized. I love being able to see what\'s in the cubes through the mesh. The mesh also lets the clothes breathe. The double zipper is great. I didn\'t find any holes or loose seams. The material itself could experience a bit of fraying on the raw edges under the inside zipper seams. In my experience, I just use scissors to trim those threads off (don\'t pull). The material is a lightweight ripstop with just enough body to have a bit of shape, allowing easier loading. Using these cubes doesn\'t take up any significant additional room in my suitcase. The tops open all the way. The fabric stays reasonably wrinkle-free.I ordered the small and slim sizes in gray. The slim is the size stated. The small is 10.5"" x 2.5"" x 6.75. So a bit smaller than the description. The cubes are not machine washable because they have a water-resistant coating. That can come off with the water and agitation of a washing machine. I plan to just wipe them down with a washcloth at the end of my trip, though I\'d prefer to be able to use a washing machine. Shouldn\'t be a problem because I put dirty laundry in plastic bags rather than directly back into my cubes.The slim cubes are perfect for fitting between the suitcase interior bars from the handle. The small size is good for playing tetris with the rest of the space, or fitting into the bottom of a pack. I use both sizes to maximize my carry-on and personal item space. Also great for my small checked bag if I need that one. I prefer smaller packing cubes because I rarely take anything that needs a bigger cube.I don\'t know how long these will last but the price and sizing are right for at least several trips.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States March 5, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Handy', 'author': 'Karl', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Being a child of divorced parents I was an expert at packing, so that‚Äôs not why I recommend these.

Here is a winner!', 'author': 'DiscerningConsumer', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""Got this right before leaving overseas. I had it loaded enough it wasn't going to fit under the seat, but probably could have if I'd not absolutely filled it. There are many manufacturers of these type of travel backpacks. I was looking for a very rectangular one without pockets that would be useless to me. I already owned several regular backpacks and wanted one that would fully open and allow easy access for clothes, shoes, toiletries, and electronics while on the go. The shoulder straps were ample and could be hidden away if you were using it as a suitcase. The strap across the back worked well to secure the backpack to my suitcase handle. One slender full length compartment was generous to accommodate a fleece jacket folded up. (Also could serve as a wet container, if needed) Another slot stowed a laptop, located against the back, with lots and lots of padding. Another area held folders of information. Also there were small envelope sized compartments. I actually used the plastic rectangular containers that came with the backpack. I should mention that the bag was tightly wrapped up and had a very strong odor. I left it fully open and didn't notice it after a day, which I was relieved to find. There are straps inside to secure the load if it isn't large enough and there are straps on the outside that cinch down the load to make it look smaller. One bottle holder on the side. Nice handles on top and side making it easy to grab. The exterior material was substantial. Laptop at the back allows better balance. There is also a zipper to expand the bag, although I really didn't use it except briefly. An extra inch or so? A sister had a smaller bag and that fit easily under the seat. If I had required it to get under I would have had to squash the bag down some. But for day to day it was great. Zippers worked easily and none of that digging through a backpack that didn't open all the way to the bottom. Nice that several other slots also opened fully. Main considerations are size needs and exactly what you will want: more or fewer pockets on the outside, more or less rectangular. While not so delightful a color, black is impervious to travel schmutz. Did wipe up nicely after I had to keep my feet on it in the car. Wish I had discovered this model sooner.

I bought this bag hoping I never run into that problem again. If you are buying it to use as your free personal item (not as a $65 carry-on item), I think you should be OK. I would give you this word of warning. They are not firm sides and top. They are flexible but with an obvious form. Don\'t over pack the bag. The bags have to go into a ""personal item"" box, freely. Meaning you can\'t push on it to get it in the box. What I like about this bag is that it is 16"", and if you keep the extender zipper closed, it is only 6"" (rather than 7.9"" which I feel might be cutting it a bit close). I plan to keep that zipper closed to that to be on the safe side. The last dimension is under the required size too. The total size is supposed to be no more than 18""x14""√ó8"". With this bag I\'m shooting for safely under, but good sized, rather than those exact dimensions. This bag arrives rolled up and very compressed. It took a little maneuvering to get it into shape. It\'s nice that it came with the 2 see-through toiletry bags. I used a few items in the pictures to show relative size. Those are a large size cooler ice pack, a pack of makeup wipes, makeup brush, and roku remote. The picture with the water bottle shows a heavy, metal, good size bottle, and it could still fit a larger one. If you tip the bag upside down, the bottle would definitely fall out, but I love that it will fit a big one. Another picture shows the pouch for the backpack straps. Tucking in the straps can only help with the box at the airline, so I really like that feature as well. I wouldn\'t call the color beige. It\'s an off white.

To get best results, fold clothes neatly before compressing, to avoid bunching up of fabric. This reduces wrinkles and maximizes saved space. Another tip is that first use of a bag takes a bit more force than I expected in order to push the air out. I was worried that I might blow out the seals, but persisted and quickly evacuated the air from the bag.

The only downside is that I had a hard time rolling the bags once filled to get all of the air out of them.. I even had my adult son who is much stronger than I am, help me - and he struggled a bit as well! We were able to make it work by rolling as much as we could and then just kneeling on or pressing on the bags in the direction of the air release! Overall they met my needs which is the reason for the 4 stars but the ease of use is more like a 3! I will definitely use these EVERY TIME I TRAVEL because they do save so much space, kept my clothes wrinkle free, and made unpacking when I got back home SO EASY as well! I would still recommend these, just know that it does take a lot of work to get all of the air out of the bags!', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 19, 2022', 'is_verified': True}]"

Plus, I wanted some luggage that made me happy to look at it! I\'m so pleased with this purchase. Here\'s why:STRAP: I love that this has a long strap, so that I can drape this over my shoulder to carry it. It\'s much more comfortable that carrying it on one shoulder, and it keeps my hands free.WASHABLE: One of the most important things for me, in deciding to buy a cloth bag, was that I be able to put it in the laundry. I try to treat my luggage well, but I\'m sure there\'s going to come a time that this bag goes on a gross airport floor, or I accidentally spill some shampoo, or something. This bag can be washed. There\'s a big rectangular piece of plastic at the bottom, and I\'ll have to figure out how to get it out without bending it too much. So, it won\'t be the easiest thing in the world, but I will be able to put this through the washing machine. That makes me happy.PRETTY: I just love this bag. I use it on work trips, and even though I work in a conservative field, I decided ""screw it,"" I want to get a pattern that makes me happy. I have this bag in the blue/white pattern, and it is just so pretty.DURABLE AND USEFUL: The bag is made of thick material. There are 5 inside pockets, which is where I keep all of my toiletries neatly organized. (I have a set of ""travel"" toiletries that stay in there all the time, so that I don\'t have to spend much time packing.) Also, there is the sleeve on the back, so that this bag can hook onto the handle of a rolling suitcase. This bag is a good size. I can put two pairs of shoes, a few changes of clothes, and my toiletries in it. It has enough room for a multi-day trip. It would probably be tight if you wanted to pack it for a whole week, but I think that would be manageable if you\'re strategic.So all in all, I\'m really happy with this!

(The Foldie took a couple of weeks; this bag arrived in a couple of days.)For context, my wife and are seasoned travelers and have used a ton of different bags over the years. This particular bag design is great, other than that it would be nice if it had a Velcro handle wrap, which none of these bags seem to have. Bu that is a minor complaint considering how versatile this bag is and how inexpensive it is.Looking at these two bags side-by-side, they are clearly manufactured either in the same plant or from the same exact design plans. The material of the bags and the straps, and the layout of the pockets, zippers, and even the labels, are all identical. They are the same bag, other than a couple of very minor differences.The only difference between this and the Foldie is:1) Foldie has a couple of YKK zippers, BUT only on the outside zippers. The inside zippers are some cheap alternate brand.2) Foldie has higher quality snaps, but the snaps are not meant to be opened and closed. Once you snap them for the first time, you will likely never unsnap them as they are merely there to keep the ends of the bag from sticking out.3) Foldie comes with a shoulder strap, but honestly, I have so many shoulder straps laying around that I\'m not going to pay all the extra money for a shoulder strap I will likely never use. (This would be uncomfortable with a shoulder strap. It\'s much more comfortable carrying it by the handles.)4) Foldie is much more expensive (nearly twice as much).5) Foldie takes longer to ship from Amazon.6) Foldie\'s label is much larger and more obnoxious.

The straps don't feel flimsy but they're not exactly heavy duty either. Overall I'd give this product a 4 star if you're planning on gate checking this bag, but 3 stars if you're planning on counter checking this bag.I've done 5 long trips with this bag and the first two trips were not bad; when you gate check this item there are no issues. The quality of the material is fine for gate checks because the item isn't as mishandled. Problem is if you check it over the counter through the oversized baggage area (which car seats have to go through) then the item will get mishandled and holes will start developing in the bag due to drag and friction from the carousels. I had a hole at the bottom of my bag by the 3rd trip from what looks to be friction burn. The bag is still usable but it's just a matter of time before it tears further. I had already asked the counter for a large plastic bag to put this bag in before sending it off to the oversized baggage area, so if I were to have done this without the plastic bag then it may have been worse.If you want this item to last then you will have to ensure you're gate checking it every time, but I can tell you that it's a real hassle to lug your car seat around the airport if you're already gate checking a stroller and have your own carry on as well as watching over a toddler.

This bag had some big shoes to fill (so to speak) and based on my use so far it has really delivered - so much so that I felt compelled to write a review.The thing I like most about the new bag (Laripwit) is how well it holds my things. For gym days, I usually have a change of clothes, two pairs of shoes, and several miscelaneous toiletry and gym items. Whereas this kind of loadout would leave my old bag stuffed to the brim, the Laripwit holds the same things comfortably and with some room to spare, all while having roughly the same exterior dimensions as my old bag. I attribute some of this to the layout and design of the pockets (which are helpful), and some I attribute to the shape of the bag (Rectangular-ish).The bag seems to be sturdily built, with quality zippers and solid material for the straps. As for the main bag material, it seems rugged, but also feels kind of thin, so while everything looks and works great now, I\'m not overly confident about long-term durability. I guess time will have to tell on that. Regardless, I\'m loving everything so far.I don\'t write a lot of reviews and for those I do write, I try to save 5 star ratings for items with quality/utility/value/etc... that really stands out. For me this bag is closer to a 4.5 as it\'s basically everything I want from a gym bag with some extra helpful utility features and a price that didn\'t break the bank. When I looked at the options (and believe me I looked) there were very few bags out there that were ""nicer"" than this one, but they all cost double and triple what this one cost (and truth be told, they weren\'t THAT much nicer).

It is the only bag on the market we could find that fit the B-Ready. We did have to take the back wheels off, but with the B-Ready this is really easy and caused no problems whatsoever. When we were ready to board we just popped the wheels off and shimmied the stroller into the bag. The baggage handlers commented that they liked the handle and the red color (which was easy to see as a gate checked item). When we arrived in Orlando, the bag was ready for us at the gate. The bag itself had a HUGE smear of black grease all along the front. I was nervous about opening it up, but I am happy to report that the stroller inside was pristine!! No dirt or grease marks at all. Without the bag, our stroller would have been completely stained (our stroller is light silver).That said, I agree that the material is flimsy and the bag won\'t last more than a few trips. The material frays and there are some holes; it clearly isn\'t designed to ""pad"" your stroller either. We have used it twice (two round trips), and I am about to purchase a new one for our next trip as our current bag is ready to be retired. But jeez, people. What do you expect for $10???

I imagine lipsticks would store well there but I only use one lip stain product so it will likely remain unused for me. The top waterproof pocket is cool, I like it but it doesn't really fit items more than maybe a half an inch wide and it is only around 3 inches tall, 8 inches ish width with a spreading capacity of around a half inch.The big pocket is a mess. There is a small little divider that is not sturdy. The big pocket is maybe about 3 inches wide and the divider is sewn in like 2 millimeters from the back (instead of more like a centered partition). There are 2, no stretch fabric pockets sewn into the back of the big pocket but it has no stretch so it wouldn't hold more than maybe a couple credit cards.Basically the spacing on this bag is really weird, but it does the job and I really can't complain since this item was on sale for ~$10 when I purchased.

I've got a upright shark vacuum that worked great to remove the air, the pump was also much easier to use then I expected. The most difficult method is the manual of course, it's a large bag so it can be challenging to get all the air out especially if your smaller. *I have only tried laying items horizontally in the bag so far and not with the bag vertical like shown in pictures so this could effect how easy it is to manually remove air.I was able to fit the huge pile of smaller bags (another brand) of toddler clothing in just 2 bags with room to spare. I was able to fit the 2 bags under half our queen bed where they continue to remain just as compact as when I placed them a few days ago (as I said before be cautious if you have a metal frame to not bump into any protruding pieces that may puncture the bag).I tried one bag on our bed pillows, we have 2 standard pillows with shames, a medium size lumbar pillow and 2 small square pillows, all of them fit in one bag easily and I was impressed at how flat I was able to get the bag (using the pump).A little tip you can label your bags with a sharpie and just use some rubbing alcohol if you ever want to remove or change the label.Definitely something I would get more of in the future."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 25, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Holds so much& saves space', 'author': 'Amazon Customer', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I can‚Äôt believe how much these hold and how much they compress!

I bought this to replace my almost perfect handbag. I live in NYC and I almost always just walk or take mass transportation when I need to go anywhere. I needed a bag that will not give me back pains when I'm carrying too much (like when I go grocery shopping), that will carry all of my essentials (wallet, water, reusable grocery bags, phone, etc), that is functional (giving me ease of access to things), and not easy for pick pocketers ('cos this is NY!). I thought this was going to be my perfect bag.I LOVED the phone pocket on the strap idea. I thought it'd give me easy access to the phone and harder access to pick pocketers. Well, I have a Samsung Note 9 and the pocket is too small. I was able to close the zipper 3/4 of the way, so I thought it still kind of worked. But when I went on the subway and had to pull the bag in front of me to make room for other people on the crowded train, my phone ended up to the back of me. With my zipper only 3/4 closed, it's just asking to be stolen. So that turned out to be a HORRIBLE idea.I had thought that the side pockets would be perfect to hold my thermos. The problem was that the netted pockets are too short for my favorite thermos. I twisted my bag around to get to my wallet and my thermos flew out. Those side pockets would work if they're taller, has maybe silicone in the elastic to give a better grip, and tighter elastics so that it's not loose around my thermos. I guess I have to use my shorter thermos, which will only last me a few hours when I'm out and about on a warm day.I originally thought the buckle on the bag was a great idea to deter pick pocketers. Well, that buckle made it so difficult to access everything in my bag. I had to unbuckle and unzip before I can get to anything in my bag. I need to have ease of access to my wallet, MetroCard, keys, phone, etc. So, this bag was really not very functional.Also, I bought the light orange color. Well, it's not orange at all. It's coral. Another disappointment.There are things that I do love about the bag though. This bag is the perfect size to be walking around anywhere. I love the look of the bag too -- the shape, the style, the material. The lining is gray, not black, which is one of my requirements for bags. It'd be better if the lining is of a brighter color though. It's hard to find stuff inside the bag when the lining is dark. I also love how it can organize my stuff in the different compartments. The best thing is that it is ergonomic. The strap was comfortable. I had no shoulder/back pain after walking for around 1/2 hour with lots of heavy grocery bags.I'm the kind of person who does not change bags. I have to figure out how to work around all these obstacles. I mean, this bag has EVERYTHING I need, but everything just fell short of being functional. My old handbag has everything I need, except that it gives me backpain. I guess I'll keep this bag. In the meantime, I'll continue my search for my perfect bag."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 27, 2022', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect bag for hitting Disney!', 'author': 'Fun in the Sun', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Thought I\'d leave a review with details for folks. Pictured is everything I loaded in. Between that photo and loading I also added spare socks and water shoes. Everything fits comfortably with room to spare. I will use the front for phone. Nothing in the back rfid pocket as I have an rfid wallet on a lanyard, that I hook to the bag or zipper so they can\'t be separated and lost. A standard umbrella (the kind you buy at the parks) fits in an outside pocket, but it\'s a little awkward. It will fit inside the back compartment. I switched it for a slightly smaller pink one that fits better in the side pocket. I may go down another size. Hey, I live in FLA and we own a lot of umbrellas! A standard water bottle (16.9 oz/500 ml) fits comfortably in the side pocket. I can also fit a larger Britta water bottle, but it\'s a little snug getting in and out. I think if I used the bigger bottle, the pocket will stretch a bit with time, so not a deal breaker. I love how my Nuimos fit too! It looks to be the perfect size for the newer ECV baskets (which are smaller than the older ones) but may be a tiny bit tight for some of the in ride pockets. I think that if I remove either the water bottle or umbrella it should fit most of the ride vehicle pockets. I cannot speak to water resistance as we are heading to the parks in a couple of days. As a larger person, I often worry that straps don\'t loosen enough. I do have it all the way out, and I have plenty of room. A couple reviews say the strap pocket is too close to the face. I found by opening it all the way, it sits down more comfortably. All in all, very happy with the bag.UPDATE: Bag worked well for WDW. Fit in ECV basket with both side pockets full. Fit most ride vehicle pockets. I did have minor issue of my water bottle coming out easily. That is probably more due to the sleek steel.sides. I added one of the ""stroller clips"" and looped my water bottle, the bag loop and umbrella stap.

I found this not only provided the form factor I wanted, but it managed to carry just about everything in my purse.The not so good.The front two zipper pockets have to be accessed by unclipping the buckle. If you\'re like me and forget to clip it back up (and not zip up a pocket) you could end up losing items. The side mesh pocket doesn\'t work for me. It\'s too small for my water bottles and too big for glass cases not to slip out.It needs some more loops so I can attach split rings and clip items to them. I had to rig up a mount that I expect to fail at some point. That is why it is four stars.The good.It fits just about everything I want to fit. I did have to add a split ring or two to the outside to clip on my phone case, but I was already doing that with my old purse.I found a space for my reading glasses in the pocket shown on the strap part. I do have to enclose the glasses in a felt slip case to protect them from being scratched by that pocket\'s zipper.It has two decently sized zip pockets in the front plus a hidden one in the back. Most of the other bags I have found have one large pocket, or are far too large. I don\'t need to carry a 10.2"" iPad.This is the Goldilocks of bags for me. Not too small and not too large. I still managed to make it heavier than the smaller bag, but at least the weight is evenly distributed across the strap any my shoulder.It\'s almost perfect. Of course I will continue my search for something larger than the earlier small bag. Something that I won\'t have to worry about losing items from should I leave a buckle unclipped.

Designed to organize and store all your essential toiletries, this bag offers several standout features while maintaining a reasonable price point.First and foremost, the cost of this toiletry bag is quite impressive. Compared to similar options on the market, it offers excellent value for the quality and functionality it provides. If you're seeking a budget-friendly solution without compromising on durability and practicality, this bag is a fantastic choice.Speaking of quality, this bag is well-constructed and built to last. The materials used are sturdy and resistant to wear and tear. I appreciate the attention to detail in its design, including the robust zippers and reinforced stitching, which add to its overall longevity. Rest assured, this bag will endure frequent use and travel adventures without letting you down.The bag's compartments and size are another noteworthy feature. It offers ample space to accommodate all of your toiletries, including bottles, tubes, brushes, and more. The various compartments help you stay organized, allowing you to separate items and access them easily when needed. The thoughtful layout ensures that you can efficiently pack and locate your essentials, saving time and reducing hassle during your travels.However, it is important to note that the main compartment lacks internal dividers. While the bag has multiple compartments, the absence of dividers in the primary storage area means you may need to exercise caution when organizing your items. This limitation could potentially lead to minor shifting and jostling of contents during transit. It would be a great improvement if the bag included internal dividers to enhance organization and prevent items from mixing together.Despite this minor drawback, the overall functionality and value of this toiletry bag remain exceptional. Its affordability, quality construction, and ample compartments make it an excellent travel companion. Whether you're going on a short weekend getaway or an extended vacation, this bag offers the convenience and space you need to keep your toiletries neatly organized and readily accessible.In conclusion, if you're searching for an affordable toiletry bag that doesn't compromise on quality and functionality, this option is definitely worth considering.

The small ones, not so much...', 'author': 'Faith', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I tested the following 4 pumps:Black, large, DC Powered:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JGMHP62/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1Black, Removable USB Cable powered:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07KJJHWLP/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1White, Attached USB cable powered:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QCWW84T/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1Black, Battery powered:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07T3P7Y8P/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1--- Review of Black, large, DC Powered ---The largest black edition of the pumps offered here is VERY powerful and fast acting! It removes are 5-6 times faster than the little USB and battery powered pumps offered on Amazon. See the photos for a comparisonI conducted 2 experiments, seeing how long it took to suck 2 different sets of bags completely empty of air:1 minute - A medium sized bag with one flat pillow in it5 minutes - A jumbo sized bag with 1 flat pillow, one extra large king size puffy pillow, 2 king size sheets, and a medium sized blanky.Pros: Very fast, extremely powerful, removes all air from the bag.Cons, large, bulky, heavy, and requires a proprietary DC wall adapter to power it. However, it was still able to easily fit in the side pocket of my backpack which I traveled with it on multiple international airplanes packed like this, and had no problems. It just adds a little extra bulk and weight.--- Review of Black, Removable USB Cable powered ---This was tied at the 2nd fastest pump, but significantly smaller and slower at removing air than the large pump.Using the same experiment:5 minutes - A medium sized bag filled the same as above28 minutes - A jumbo sized bag filled the same as abovePros: Small, lightweight, removable USB cable allows you to use a shorter or longer cable as desired.Cons: Very slow at removing air, compared to the large pump.--- Review of White, Attached USB cable powered: ---This was tied at the 2nd fastest pump, the exact same size as the small black pump.Using the same experiment:5 minutes - A medium sized bag filled the same as above28 minutes - A jumbo sized bag filled the same as abovePros: Small, lightweight, non-removable USB cable (can't lose it).Cons: Very slow at removing air, compared to the large pump, non-removable USB cable (can't use a shorter cable, but can make it longer using a USB extension cable).--- Review of Black, Battery powered ---This was the same size as the other 2 small USB powered pumps. It was very, very slow at removing air. I didn't conduct the same test, because I gave up due to how slow it is. However, it was probably the same speed as the 2 USB powered cables I tested, now that I realize how slow they are as well. It was about the same. I may try the test again in the future if I decide I want a battery powered pump.Pros: Battery operated, can run while charging, small, lightweightCons: Very slow at removing air, battery will eventually die after a few years.------------------------Overall, I am keeping the large pump for use at home, and I may even bring it with me on traveling. I like the idea of using a lightweight, 5 times smaller pump... but I don't like the idea of it taking 5 times longer to pack.The main reason is that usually I need to pack in a hurry when I'm traveling, to catch a flight or taxi somewhere. If I have to vacuum seal 5 bags with the large pump, it would only take me 2.5 minutes per bag on average (using a mix of small, medium, large, and jumbo bags), which nets me just under 15 minutes to pack all my bags.That same load would take around 75 minutes to pack using the small USB or battery powered pumps... which makes me unlikely to use them in reality. The only place I could use it being useful is on an airplane, since I like to bring pillows and blankys in the cabin. I could then vacuum seal it before unboarding the plane and pack it back in my carry on.This wasn't possible with the large pump due to the fact that it has a wall mounted power adapter, and the plane only offers USB power, or the proprietary plane jacks. I just resorted to manually laying on my vacuum bags and forcing the air out when unboarding the plane, which worked well enough to stuff it by force back into my carry on. A little USB pump would help make this process much easier, though, Lol. I suppose I could bring one of the manual hand vacuum pumps on board, even though they take a long of physical stamina, they work pretty rapidly and effectively.So, I haven't decided if I'll keep any of the little ones yet. It would be either the black USB powered, because of the replaceable cable, or Black battery powered if I do. Although, the white USB powered pump was just as good, but there has to be some deciding factor.I hope this review helps you in your selection of a nice vacuum pump!!"", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 21, 2019', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Works great.

This product travels well, small size on it's own so easy to include in my bag without making the situation worse. The vacuum bags also seem to close well and hold their seal. However, the suction leaves a LOT to be desired. At home, when packing, I can use the vacuum to really tamp the size down. But, once in the hotel, the suction machine is not very powerful so unfortunately I don't get the same results.

I purchased this bag around the holiday season. I was looking for a bag that specifically has a designated shoe compartment, enough general storage, multiple compartments, and that is an overall aesthetic looking bag. If you are someone that is looking for similar qualities, this is the bag for you.You can expect a durable duffle bag that has more than enough space to store everything you might need for either a weekend away or a trip to the gym. Even with shoes in the shoe compartment, I have been able to fit multiple outfits and miscellaneous objects such as hygiene kits and laptops in the bag without any issues at all.The designated show compartment is amazing. You don‚Äôt have to worry about dirty shoes getting your clothes (or anything else you would carry in your main compartment) dirty. The fact that you can have a separated compartment to put shoes is a major benefit. The compartment is easily big enough to fit 2 pairs of shoes. This is a feature you‚Äôll likely really enjoy.In addition to the shoe compartment and the main compartment, this bag contains several smaller compartments and pockets as well. If you are like me, you prefer to keep smaller items such as phones, wallets, and watches in smaller compartments. This way you don‚Äôt have to dig around the main compartment to find them. This feature will keep everything organized in a convenient way for you.The bag looks like it costs more than the price you will pay for it. Personally, I take the Weekender Overnight Duffel Bag into the office with me every day. It is something I am honestly proud to carry around, and if you get it you will be too. For its incredibly reasonable price, I don‚Äôt think you will get a classier looking bag.Overall, I give this bag 5 stars.

CONS: the open pockets on the inside allow for easy access but does not have an elastic strap or strip of fabric that holds items in place to prevent items from slipping out (see photo) my workaround was to place a ribbon with velcro around the open pockets to hold things in place until I find a better structural design (see picture).', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 22, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': ""5.0 out of 5 stars Product perfect *Choosing Amazon delayed delivery for digital reward Don't DO IT"", 'author': 'Just an honest girl*', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Bag was perfect and cute worth the buy BUT CHOOSING TO HELP AMAZON CUT BACK ON PACKING AND DELIVERY BY CHOOSING THEIR OFFER OF DIGITAL REARD FOR LATER DELIVERIES&PACKING-ITS A JOKE ALL MY STUFF 5 ITEMS WERE SPLIT UP AND DELIVERED DAYS LATER AND THIS BAG PARTICULARLY CAME IN A CLEAR BAG SHOWING THE ITEM AND NOW I CANT EVEN GET ANYINE RO MMM', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 10, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Good quality', 'author': 'HappyK', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I bought this and I loved it .

I imagine lipsticks would store well there but I only use one lip stain product so it will likely remain unused for me. The top waterproof pocket is cool, I like it but it doesn't really fit items more than maybe a half an inch wide and it is only around 3 inches tall, 8 inches ish width with a spreading capacity of around a half inch.The big pocket is a mess. There is a small little divider that is not sturdy. The big pocket is maybe about 3 inches wide and the divider is sewn in like 2 millimeters from the back (instead of more like a centered partition). There are 2, no stretch fabric pockets sewn into the back of the big pocket but it has no stretch so it wouldn't hold more than maybe a couple credit cards.Basically the spacing on this bag is really weird, but it does the job and I really can't complain since this item was on sale for ~$10 when I purchased.

I recently purchased the royal blue version of this bag for an upcoming trip, and I couldn't be happier with my choice.Firstly, the size of the bag is just right. It's compact enough to fit in my carry-on luggage without taking up too much space but spacious enough to hold all of my toiletries. The dimensions are 9.5(L)x 4.7(W)x 5.9(H) inches, and it weighs only 3.6 oz, making it ultra-lightweight.What I love most about this bag is its easy carrying. The side handle makes it convenient to grab and go and can also be used for hanging in the bathroom. This feature is suitable in a hotel room with limited counter space.In terms of quality, the WANDF toiletry bag is top-notch. The water-resistant, durable nylon fabric and SBS zippers make it a long-lasting investment. The breathable mesh and clean stitching provide a well-ventilated and neat compartment for your toiletries.The bag is also thoughtfully designed with multiple compartments. The main room can hold more oversized items such as shampoo bottles or shaving cream. The zippered mesh pouch keeps your miniature toiletries and cosmetics organized and easily visible. Additionally, the front zipper pocket provides extra storage space.Lastly, this bag is versatile and can be used for various purposes. It's suitable for both men and women and can be used as a traditional toiletry bag, makeup or shaving kit case, a safe place to store your healthcare items while traveling, or even as a carry-on airline bag.In conclusion, I highly recommend the WANDF Hanging Dopp Kit to anyone needing a reliable and practical toiletry bag.

Designed to organize and store all your essential toiletries, this bag offers several standout features while maintaining a reasonable price point.First and foremost, the cost of this toiletry bag is quite impressive. Compared to similar options on the market, it offers excellent value for the quality and functionality it provides. If you're seeking a budget-friendly solution without compromising on durability and practicality, this bag is a fantastic choice.Speaking of quality, this bag is well-constructed and built to last. The materials used are sturdy and resistant to wear and tear. I appreciate the attention to detail in its design, including the robust zippers and reinforced stitching, which add to its overall longevity. Rest assured, this bag will endure frequent use and travel adventures without letting you down.The bag's compartments and size are another noteworthy feature. It offers ample space to accommodate all of your toiletries, including bottles, tubes, brushes, and more. The various compartments help you stay organized, allowing you to separate items and access them easily when needed. The thoughtful layout ensures that you can efficiently pack and locate your essentials, saving time and reducing hassle during your travels.However, it is important to note that the main compartment lacks internal dividers. While the bag has multiple compartments, the absence of dividers in the primary storage area means you may need to exercise caution when organizing your items. This limitation could potentially lead to minor shifting and jostling of contents during transit. It would be a great improvement if the bag included internal dividers to enhance organization and prevent items from mixing together.Despite this minor drawback, the overall functionality and value of this toiletry bag remain exceptional. Its affordability, quality construction, and ample compartments make it an excellent travel companion. Whether you're going on a short weekend getaway or an extended vacation, this bag offers the convenience and space you need to keep your toiletries neatly organized and readily accessible.In conclusion, if you're searching for an affordable toiletry bag that doesn't compromise on quality and functionality, this option is definitely worth considering. While it lacks internal dividers in the main compartment, its overall design, cost-effectiveness, and well-thought-out compartments make it a reliable choice for travelers.

I bought this to replace my almost perfect handbag. I live in NYC and I almost always just walk or take mass transportation when I need to go anywhere. I needed a bag that will not give me back pains when I'm carrying too much (like when I go grocery shopping), that will carry all of my essentials (wallet, water, reusable grocery bags, phone, etc), that is functional (giving me ease of access to things), and not easy for pick pocketers ('cos this is NY!). I thought this was going to be my perfect bag.I LOVED the phone pocket on the strap idea. I thought it'd give me easy access to the phone and harder access to pick pocketers. Well, I have a Samsung Note 9 and the pocket is too small. I was able to close the zipper 3/4 of the way, so I thought it still kind of worked. But when I went on the subway and had to pull the bag in front of me to make room for other people on the crowded train, my phone ended up to the back of me. With my zipper only 3/4 closed, it's just asking to be stolen. So that turned out to be a HORRIBLE idea.I had thought that the side pockets would be perfect to hold my thermos. The problem was that the netted pockets are too short for my favorite thermos. I twisted my bag around to get to my wallet and my thermos flew out. Those side pockets would work if they're taller, has maybe silicone in the elastic to give a better grip, and tighter elastics so that it's not loose around my thermos. I guess I have to use my shorter thermos, which will only last me a few hours when I'm out and about on a warm day.I originally thought the buckle on the bag was a great idea to deter pick pocketers. Well, that buckle made it so difficult to access everything in my bag. I had to unbuckle and unzip before I can get to anything in my bag. I need to have ease of access to my wallet, MetroCard, keys, phone, etc. So, this bag was really not very functional.Also, I bought the light orange color. Well, it's not orange at all. It's coral. Another disappointment.There are things that I do love about the bag though. This bag is the perfect size to be walking around anywhere. I love the look of the bag too -- the shape, the style, the material. The lining is gray, not black, which is one of my requirements for bags. It'd be better if the lining is of a brighter color though. It's hard to find stuff inside the bag when the lining is dark. I also love how it can organize my stuff in the different compartments. The best thing is that it is ergonomic. The strap was comfortable. I had no shoulder/back pain after walking for around 1/2 hour with lots of heavy grocery bags.I'm the kind of person who does not change bags. I have to figure out how to work around all these obstacles. I mean, this bag has EVERYTHING I need, but everything just fell short of being functional. My old handbag has everything I need, except that it gives me backpain. I guess I'll keep this bag. In the meantime, I'll continue my search for my perfect bag."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 27, 2022', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect bag for hitting Disney!', 'author': 'Fun in the Sun', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Thought I\'d leave a review with details for folks. Pictured is everything I loaded in. Between that photo and loading I also added spare socks and water shoes. Everything fits comfortably with room to spare. I will use the front for phone. Nothing in the back rfid pocket as I have an rfid wallet on a lanyard, that I hook to the bag or zipper so they can\'t be separated and lost. A standard umbrella (the kind you buy at the parks) fits in an outside pocket, but it\'s a little awkward. It will fit inside the back compartment. I switched it for a slightly smaller pink one that fits better in the side pocket. I may go down another size. Hey, I live in FLA and we own a lot of umbrellas! A standard water bottle (16.9 oz/500 ml) fits comfortably in the side pocket. I can also fit a larger Britta water bottle, but it\'s a little snug getting in and out. I think if I used the bigger bottle, the pocket will stretch a bit with time, so not a deal breaker. I love how my Nuimos fit too! It looks to be the perfect size for the newer ECV baskets (which are smaller than the older ones) but may be a tiny bit tight for some of the in ride pockets. I think that if I remove either the water bottle or umbrella it should fit most of the ride vehicle pockets. I cannot speak to water resistance as we are heading to the parks in a couple of days. As a larger person, I often worry that straps don\'t loosen enough. I do have it all the way out, and I have plenty of room. A couple reviews say the strap pocket is too close to the face. I found by opening it all the way, it sits down more comfortably. All in all, very happy with the bag.UPDATE: Bag worked well for WDW. Fit in ECV basket with both side pockets full. Fit most ride vehicle pockets. I did have minor issue of my water bottle coming out easily. That is probably more due to the sleek steel.sides.

I found this not only provided the form factor I wanted, but it managed to carry just about everything in my purse.The not so good.The front two zipper pockets have to be accessed by unclipping the buckle. If you\'re like me and forget to clip it back up (and not zip up a pocket) you could end up losing items. The side mesh pocket doesn\'t work for me. It\'s too small for my water bottles and too big for glass cases not to slip out.It needs some more loops so I can attach split rings and clip items to them. I had to rig up a mount that I expect to fail at some point. That is why it is four stars.The good.It fits just about everything I want to fit. I did have to add a split ring or two to the outside to clip on my phone case, but I was already doing that with my old purse.I found a space for my reading glasses in the pocket shown on the strap part. I do have to enclose the glasses in a felt slip case to protect them from being scratched by that pocket\'s zipper.It has two decently sized zip pockets in the front plus a hidden one in the back. Most of the other bags I have found have one large pocket, or are far too large. I don\'t need to carry a 10.2"" iPad.This is the Goldilocks of bags for me. Not too small and not too large. I still managed to make it heavier than the smaller bag, but at least the weight is evenly distributed across the strap any my shoulder.It\'s almost perfect.

Always be careful handling them for best results.Although these seem thin (like most other bags) they are able to hold a lot and really hold when you suck the air out of them.I got the 8 count, the bags a giant! They would be a good size to store under furniture or if you have really large containers or spaces to store them in. They are great for large amounts of clothing, thick bedding, pillows, etc.It even came with a pump (or whatever you'd call the opposite) that you can use to remove air. You have the option to manually squeeze air out of the bag, use the pump or a vacuum. I've got a upright shark vacuum that worked great to remove the air, the pump was also much easier to use then I expected. The most difficult method is the manual of course, it's a large bag so it can be challenging to get all the air out especially if your smaller. *I have only tried laying items horizontally in the bag so far and not with the bag vertical like shown in pictures so this could effect how easy it is to manually remove air.I was able to fit the huge pile of smaller bags (another brand) of toddler clothing in just 2 bags with room to spare. I was able to fit the 2 bags under half our queen bed where they continue to remain just as compact as when I placed them a few days ago (as I said before be cautious if you have a metal frame to not bump into any protruding pieces that may puncture the bag).I tried one bag on our bed pillows, we have 2 standard pillows with shames, a medium size lumbar pillow and 2 small square pillows, all of them fit in one bag easily and I was impressed at how flat I was able to get the bag (using the pump).A little tip you can label your bags with a sharpie and just use some rubbing alcohol if you ever want to remove or change the label.Definitely something I would get more of in the future."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 25, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Holds so much& saves space', 'author': 'Amazon Customer', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I can‚Äôt believe how much these hold and how much they compress!

I needed a backpack that opened more like a suitcase so I could easily find or shuffle items. I didn't even know that existed!I found it and more in this bag. 40L makes for a lot of room! I love everything about this bag - except for the non-zippered pockets in the main compartment because anything I put in them slides out and I find it in amongst my things in the main compartment (I'm thinking I might be able to modify the pockets with a few stitches to keep things in them better.) I have taken this bag camping, on overnight and weekend trips, and now am planning on testing my packing skills and taking only it on a 6-day trip in early fall though I'll have bulkier clothing to pack. I will also be flying with it for the first time in October, and I will update this review with my experience since I will be on a budget airline and I am planning on using this bag as a personal item and as my only luggage. I love that the straps fold away for carrying ease and that keeps the straps from catching on things (like airplane seat arms while walking to my seat...true story). I love all the zippered pockets and all the well-thought out details in this bag. It's sleek, it's pretty and still functional! It's even expandable! It's very well-made and durable. It's also a nice touch that it comes with the bonus two clear zippered pouches. My laptop fits perfectly in the laptop space and doesn't infringe on the usable space in the main compartment - unlike in my laptop backpack. I bought the black version of this bag for my husband and he is very particular about his backpacks. He loves it and has taken it on every trip! Next year we'll be flying for a 2-week trip, and I am planning to take only this bag with me as my luggage and pack a portable backpack inside for day trips. I highly recommend buying this bag! One tip: In the main compartment, put something at the bottom and the top to give the bag a little more structure while packing because otherwise you're fighting a little with the sides and top and bottom caving in as you pack. Remove when finished packing. (2 PCs of cardboard work well) It's become a pet peeve of mine because I utilize every inch of space I can.

They don't feel flimsy or cheap and I still have plenty of extra space to add more items if I wanted to throw in a blanket or jacket.Much more spacious than my Northface borealis, the antitheft pocket is a personal fave. The water bottle holder fits my 40oz hydroflask just about perfectly, theres a few wet pockets for toiletries and easy access pockets for things like chapstick, gum, headphones, whatever you'd need quick access to. A few compartments inside the main large pocket for pens, small notebooks, etc.My only other concern is choosing the lighter color, I'm worried about wear and tear showing vs the darker color options but I love how bright and pretty the bag is and the waterproof material seems like it won't hold stains or dirt too much.Definitely worth the price at first glance, will update after I see how it survives airports, winter weather and office travel."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 28, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Very useful!', 'author': 'Raphaella prates', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'This bag has a lot of space for everything you need on a trip.

Most were just too thin shaped to hold my reusable lunch containers or hold the bag with my extra shoes for after work or the extra sweater for layering, or all of the above, depending on the day. And i was NOT looking for a hiking-type backpack - they aren\'t structured enough and are too floppy and hard to find things in and just look crummy. Im too old for that,, LOL!! Anyway, found this one and decided to give it a go. I love this bag. It is big, but I knew it would be. It seems well made and is still holding up well after a couple months of daily use in spite of sometimes being very loaded down. It has thoughtful pockets (along with padded laptop and tablet pockets) and should work well for travel. The ""tissue"" side pocket is worthless for me but I put my water bottle in that one so I can put my phone or whatever in the solid one. My favorite feature is that the top opens up wide and it stands up and stays open. That feature also causes what is, for me, the only downside - which is trying to close it. To zip up the main compartment you have to hold it closed with one hand while pulling the zipper with the other. For me, this is a worthwhile tradeoff because I love the huge top opening which makes it wonderfully easy to pack, unpack, and find what you need. This bag does herculean duty while looking fairly polished and neat.While I haven\'t taken it on a flight yet, I think it will work well. Its a little big, though so we\'ll see how that works on a cramped airplane.

Like most that hang, it tends to tip forward and nearly or actually dump out items. It all depends on how much weight is in the bag that is toward the front.One thing that needs to change about the design is to either have 2 zippers on each side pocket or have the one zipper go from front to back rather than back to front. This way, if hanging, the items in these pockets are less likely to fall out if you could have the zipper at the top corner of the pocket but still open, if that makes sense.The main body of the bag is very spacious and holds a lot.

I use one every day! . BUT I needed a smaller-lighter bag for sight-seeing and cruise shore excursions.This one is perfect size! I packed it with the items I typically want to carry: 1) my phone (it fits in the front zippered compartment and the back slot) and it is easy to retrieve from either place, when I will need to use it. (Some purses have a slot for the phone, but it is so tight that I struggle to take it out or put it back--NOT with this purse! 2) The main compartment easily held a small wallet, pack of tissues, small sanitizer, small sun-screen, lip gloss, narrow-folding-hair-brush. 3) The passport slot easily held two passports, which I carry in RFID paper sleeves, but they also fit inside the interior zippered compartment (I worry about the passports slipping out of my purse or grabbed, if I need to open the bag for any other reason--so I keep them secure in a zippered slot along with the vaccine card). I probably will not use the credit card slots, because my wallet is so small, it fits in the bag and I carry more than 3 cards, so I may use the slots for airline checked-baggage tickets or parking stubs or receipts.)I probably won\'t use the bag as a fanny-pack; it just felt too heavy just hanging around my waist, but the option is there, if needed.

I basically put all my pajamas/tshirts/leggings in one, all my dress clothes in another, casual tops in one, jeans and casual bottoms in one, under garments/socks/tights in one, then all team sportswear in another (I went to Vegas for the 2024 super bowl). Then on my way back I was able to put all my dirty clothes in one bag so they didn‚Äôt stink up the clean clothes I didn‚Äôt end up wearing! I FIT SO MUCH in my suitcase it was amazing!! Another thing I was surprised about was nothing really wrinkled oddly, I brought a wrinkle spray just in case, didn‚Äôt have to use it once, my dad and brother had to use the whole bottle for there clothes!!!HIGHLY RECOMMEND!The clips might come off, but are super easy to put back on!‚ÄúTaylor Wynn‚Äù on YouTube has a great in depth tutorial on how to use them and what to use them for while she was traveling internationally!

I learned how to crochet and am finally up to making sweaters so my pile has grown significantly. I was quite pleased with the compaction when using the pump. I now have a solid brick of sweaters that fit between my dresser and my wall.I am going to use the bags for my yarn, too. What better way to keep the yarn fresh, dust-free, moth-free, and organized than to squish it all down?! I got the idea from a post wherein the poster showed how their yarn had arrived vacuum sealed. We all had a good laugh, but then we all thought . . . this is brilliant! No longer will I accidentally use this skein or that hank for a project when I had purchased it for something else. If I have to table a project for a bit I can seal it up, with the hook, so everything stays together. For smaller projects I'll use my food sealer, but for blankets these bags are roomy enough.Now, the travel bags were a disappointment. I rolled and rolled and rolled, and I felt as though the bags would burst before they would blow out air. They simply don't work as well as the pump bags. It's a nice thought, but execution is lacking.Someone mentioned spraying Febreeze in their bags before sealing. On one hand it's clever, but on the other I'm thinking it would Have to completely dry before sealing, and I don't have that sort of patience. A dryer sheet, sachet, or a soap sleeve, though . . . there's potential there.My biggest concern with traveling with sealed bags is TSA. If those guys decide to have a peek in my bag and unsealed it, what a mess that could be!Clothing Definitely wrinkles. Most hotels have irons these days, but I'll caution that a wrinkle release spray may be a good idea to pack.The other issue I ran into with travel was the length of the bag once sealed and pumped out. The bag is quite inflexible so it's difficult to fit into a bag and one must plan carefully when arranging clothes in the bag prior to pulling the air out. Mine also did not flatten, but curled. That made for wasted space in my bag for our return trip. I may have overstuffed and likely should have brought along a second bag. I didn't realize it was going to be in the 50s in Vegas and we would need to purchase additional clothing to be comfortable. I used a carry-on sized bag, which is normally more than sufficient for 5 days, even for a gal; however, with those additional clothes and souvenirs (and lotions I got hoodwinked into purchasing /sigh) I found myself having to get creative, and I had to unzip the extender for the first time.I'm traveling again so if I use the bags and find that two works better than one, I'll update. The pump fit fine so I tossed the roll up bags to the side and took the pump with me instead. I do recommend getting an electric pump. It was quite the work out, and not too pleasant with arthritis and herniated discs. I survived without serious injury (only a crick in the neck that wouldn't go away), but an electric pump would have been appreciated."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States April 13, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Worked great', 'author': 'Jpeyton', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I bought this so that I could air seal stuff for our trip to make more fit in our suitcases.

Once everything was all packed, I tried following the instructions but it didn't work that well for me, but the bags did work on how I did it. I wasn't able to really roll the bags due to the thickness, so what I did is zipped most of it and left a little section open for air to come out and then I pressed on it, then I folded it in half to remove more air and once I felt all the air that I could remove was out I completed the zipping. I was amazed on how compressed it came out. So on a carryon we were able to pack a total of 7 fleeced lined pants, 3 hoodie sweaters, 6 shirts, 10 boxer briefs, and 10 socks in 3 compression bags.For his personal bag (a backpack that I purchased from Amazon) We compressed a winter jacket also purchased from Amazon and a vest and still had room to add his personal hygiene items, snacks, 2 phone batteries. With these bags there was no need to check in a luggage and it all worked out! Loved them and will definitely use for future trips, especially for myself bc I'm an over packer...haha!

I purchased these bags so I could vacuum seal my heavier coat so I could bring it as back up without taking up too much room. It was easy to seal the bag and suck the air out; however the manual pump did take awhile and sometimes the seal part got stuck on the fabric and I had to maneuver it differently to suck more air out. I would prefer bags with an electric pump. I tried a couple of vacuums, but nothing but the manual pump worked.I was so pleased by how much it reduced the size, that I then stayed up late to vacuum seal some pillows and a queen size comforter. I tried the included travel bags where you roll the extra air out of them. While this worked, I can't say it really saved much space and I wound up not bringing these bags with me.

And it's well laid out to hold your stuff securely in both folded up mode and expanded into a hanging configuration - the big pockets are deep and have elastic bands to secure bulkier, heavier bottles. The smaller pockets are narrow enough to keep your smaller items from shifting, and yet I think there's enough space in the folded up configuration to let you stuff this really seriously full. And the fact that it has 4 separate zipper seal compartments should keep any bottle exploding to a contained zone.Took a good look at the zippers - which were gold, giving the whole thing a nice lux look - and they also look pretty indestructible. But the real test is going to be filling it (overfilling it?) a few times and subjecting it to the trunk of my car - an endless source of trauma and jostling. Will post back here if I ever manage to do damage. :)So far - great product for a somewhat accident prone person on the go!UPDATE - after first trip! - I used this as my bag for all liquid/gooey/spillable cosmetics when I flew from the East Coast to Puerta Vallarta - not a short trip and not always gentle checked bag handling. It was a solid product. I packed a BUNCH of fun self care stuff, it all fit well, and made the trip both ways without any goo penetrating the rest of my luggage. I DID have an explosion of a pot of foot creme, and it was well contained in one of the larger compartments of the bag, and easy to clean with a wet washcloth.It hung up well in the hotel room, and that's where I learned how helpful the elastic bands are - when it hangs, you really want to use them to keep bottles upright, as the weight of the overall container will distort it a bit, and it's easy for everything to get jumbled up. I have some short/weird shaped bottles, so that was a bit of a trial and error process to get stuff to sit in the bag well enough to be accessible - but not a big problem.Totally a winner of a product on a long trip where you want all sorts of goop to protect and nuture your skin and hair!"", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 26, 2024', 'is_verified': False}]"

I was drawn to this bag because of the features and a few colors. I ended up getting it in black.This bag has very nice safety features that is awesome for traveling and an alternative to carrying a huge purse. I cruise alot and this is a great choice when u get off the ship.The bag is very light. The back of the bag has a pocket but doesnt have any closure. It measures about 8 1/2 inches deep. It could be good for documents or items u need to reach quickly. The front of the bag has 2 zippered pockets. The great thing about the zippered pockets is that it connects and locks to a hook on the side of the purse. This helps prevent someone from unzipping ur bag. Both pockets measures about 4 inches deep. The top of the bag has a zippered closure. It measures close to 10 inches deep. The purse has an inside zippered closure pocket that measures close to 6 inches. The other side on the inside of the purse, there is a section that has credit cards slots. It has RFID technology. The other inside pocket is large enough for maybe a cell phone, pens or whatever u like. The inside is light grey and the material feels like a rain jacket - possibly waterproof without feeling plastic. The outside of the purse is made of some sort of waterproof material. The bag and strap is slash proof. The strap end has a hook that locks to the bag.Overall, I am excited about this bag. I cannot wait to use it. The price is reasonable especially given the features. This bag is very plain and basic looking but is a powerful little thing.I will leave another review after it's used. I attached pictures to help with ur decision. I give it 5 stars due to quality. But if anyone is uncertain, give it a try.UPDATE: 6/14/22 - This is an update since 2020 when I first purchased the security bag. I've been using this bag for several trips as a travel bag. It has held up very well. No tears, rips or broken zippers. I have 2 passports and a wallet that I often put in the bag. It has gotten a bit cramped with everything. I honestly don't think the bag is designed to have alot in it except keys, wallets, etc. I ultimately purchased another travelon bag that was a bit bigger but can still be crampy if overloaded.

I was going on vacation 2 days after I tecieved it and had to remedy this concern. So, I added two black zip ties cut to length on either side of it and that put my mind at ease that even if the locking mechanism failed my purse wouldn't just drop off my body. Now all the goo and why I gave it 4 stars. The other zippers have a great, secure locking clasp and the inside has secure slots for your ID, credit cards etc. The strap is secured with a non cut through light wire meshing and the fabric is an easy to wipe clean nylon. In 85¬∞ full sun this was not hot nor uncomfortable to wear. Came with a smart little press flashlight inside to see into the deepest corners.

The classic black Travelon bag is the longest and narrowest of the bags I purchased, at 10 inches in length by 9 inches in width. It has three locking pockets and a deep open pouch at the back. All the pockets are the same width or only slightly narrower than the bag itself. Of all the bags, these pockets were the easiest and most satisfying to lock. In fact, I'd say the ease of it and the click of the clip is really quite delightful. The placement of the clips is also aesthetically pleasing.1. The lower front pocket is 5.5 inches deep. It is black lined rather than the usual light grey, and has no organizational pockets.2. The upper front pocket was surprising shallow at 5 inches, and is also lined with black and contains no organizational pockets.3. The main pocket is lined in soft grey and has a light on a short lanyard to help you see the inside. It contains three credit card slots, a cellphone pocket, a passport pocket, and one large zippered interior pocket. The main pocket is deep, but is narrow and tight and is difficult to get into - and I have small hands. I believe this is the only pocket with RIFD protection.4. The back pouch is 9.5 inches deep, and is open and therefore unsecure. I can imagine it would be excessively helpful for chucking in random unimportant items.The bag has a very slim profile. Great for minimalist travel. It would fit only the essentials in it.The strap is as usual rough and stiff because of the slash resistant feature. It is very adjustable though, and can be short or long as you desire.As you can see from the picture, the Classic black is significantly taller and narrower than the East/West crossbody.Of the four I purchased, the boho water bottle tote is definitely staying. I'm hemming and hahing between the East/West crossbody and the mini shoulder bag - leaning towards the e/w crossbody as it's easier to get into - and the classic black is definitely going back. It's just too narrow and constricted. A pity. I do love the satisfying ease of the locking clips on this one - as opposed to the e/w crossbody where a couple of them are just an absolute pain.

I have really tried to get packing down to a science, and continue to try, and improve since it‚Äôs always a tedious project. One thing I always seem to have without fail, is several bags for toiletry needs, and jewelry. I‚Äôve tried to find a nice bag that will accommodate both in the past, but there‚Äôs always been one issue, or the other with all of them. Welp, this toiletry bag might be the official winner! The interior has nicely sized pockets, that will accommodate hair products, and makeup. The interior pockets are made with vinyl for leaks, and easy to care for. The overall size of the bag is great, and exactly what you‚Äôd want for ease of packing, but enough space for all of your belongings. There‚Äôs a hook for hanging to free up counter space. The exciting aspect of this bag for me though, is the jewelry organizer. The jewelry area hits all the rights marks for me when it comes to travel. The jewelry storage is generously sized for starters, with areas made for all types of items. The individual areas are designed to keep everything in its place, safe, and tangle free. There‚Äôs an area for earrings, necklaces, rings, and bracelets. My absolute favorite detail (that some may not even notice), is the necklace slots for each individual necklace. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times my necklaces have knotted, and what a headache that can be.

The thing I‚Äôve never liked about my old packing cubes is how big they are, because I always had to mix clothes together that I didn‚Äôt want to mix (ie swimsuits with pajamas, shirts with bottoms, etc). It was also a pain to pack because the biggest size always took up almost an entire side of the suitcase and really limited what else you could add to that side. These cubes, in my opinion, are PERFECT because you can organize more strategically with the smaller options and pack Tetris style to fit way more. I also love that there‚Äôs a little clear pocket on the top of the cube to add a label for each cube for what‚Äôs inside!I didn‚Äôt think I needed a laundry bag because I usually just bring a garbage bag with me for that, but this will be much classier (ha).As I mentioned above, it‚Äôs tempting to overfill because it seems like there‚Äôs still so much room left when it‚Äôs not compressed, but that feature isn‚Äôt magic so just be mindful of that when packing them.

However, the compression feature doesn't always deliver the desired results. While some items compress nicely, others seem to resist compression entirely, leading to frustration and uneven packing. Additionally, overfilling the cubes can cause the zippers to strain and even break, limiting their effectiveness.

Gorilla Grips is a favorite brand, so I was confident the cubes would be a well made product. Traditionally I have more or less made my own packing cubes by using very large 2.5 gallon ziplock bags, about the average size of a clothing cube. In my ready to go one night suitcase, I had one ziplock bag with houseshoes/nightgown/robe and another with a change of clothes for both myself and my husband. I transferred these to the two largest cubes; they fit easily and in fact I was able to add another item or two to the biggest cube.I didn't discover the cubes had two zippers until later. I packed with the compression zipper already closed! But it worked, I just had to tug harder to get the first zipper around the bags. But it would have been much easier had I realized you unzip the compression zipper first.The cubes appeal to my desire for tidiness, but I did lose the clear windows of the ziplock bags. So I'm faced with two bags without a hint of what is in each of them. I could fix that by making laminated labels. I might even buy another color and separate my clothes from my husbands. One day of night clothes and underwear and outerwear would definitely fit in one bag. Of course for longer trips you'd probably want to separate the outerwear and underwear and nightgowns into different bags. I used the 3rd smaller cube for some of my costmetics - no real compression there.Did they save room over the ziplocks? I'm not sure, probably at least a little. Were they neater, more pleasing? Definitely. And for sure easier to open and dress out of than ziplocks!I am undecided if I want to go further in the Gorilla Grips cube world. I don't travel that much. If I did, I'm pretty sure I'd also try the Gorilla grip cubes with a mesh window. That product doesn't have the compression zipper, and it is hard to tell if the compression is less. But the mesh window gives a hint of what is inside and lets the items breathe a bit. Then I'd outfit my husband and I with color coded cubes with whatever product seems to work best for us.This product is very reasonably priced, and it's worth the small investment to enter the cube world.

They arrived neatly zipped up and folded into themselves, and I was a little worried they were the wrong size, but opening the package showed they were just as described, and how compact they could truly be!Each packing cube has a handle for easy carrying when full, a main zipper to open the compartment (with zipper pulls so it can be opened and closed separately from each direction), and a zipper to compress the packed cube. I like the zipper pulls on the smooth closing zippers as well. The material is lightweight, which is excellent for travel, and seems easy to clean off, yet durable. The inside seams look clean, though there were a few long threads dangling on the inside - I recommend trimming these so they don't get snagged in the zippers. I I have the light grey color, which allows me to see the clothes through the material.Now to answer - does compression really save space? See my pictures and you'll be able to tell how much it really does save. I have photos numbered 1-6:(1) These are the 14 adult size medium lightweight t-shirts into the medium sized cubed(2) I easily put in 2 stacks of 7 shirts side by side(3) It easily sipped shut, and I used my hand to show the size of the pack when closed.(4) Then I applied the compression by zipping up the compression zipper. You can see the compression works and makes the packing cube much more compact.(5) I've always rolled my shirts when I pack, so I decided to try it again. I rolled the 14 shirts, each layer fit 7 shirts just as easily as before.(6) I zipped it closed and applied compression. WOW! THIS IS THE WAY TO PACK - it's much more uniform all around and less bulgy so it will be easier to arrange in the luggage.I think this assortment of sizes is perfect as I'll be able to pack intimates in the smallest cube, shirts in the medium cube, and pants/jackets in the lighter cube.

After folding and fitting items into a bag and zipping it up I could then zip up the other zipper and everything would be compressed down to 1/2 to 2/3 the original depth.The zippers seemed quite sturdy through the process and didn't feel like they would break or separate. Whether the items wrinkled or not seemed to depend on the fabric, but for the most part nothing was too wrinkled to wear after a little shake out and some Downy Wrinkle Release.The only thing I would change with these bags is the length of the corded pulls on the zippers.

To get best results, fold clothes neatly before compressing, to avoid bunching up of fabric. This reduces wrinkles and maximizes saved space. Another tip is that first use of a bag takes a bit more force than I expected in order to push the air out. I was worried that I might blow out the seals, but persisted and quickly evacuated the air from the bag.

Another benefit I found is that if you‚Äôre digging around for something in your packed bag the storage bags are easily moved or removed without turning your bag contents into a shambles. I find that my clothes are less wrinkled, and since they‚Äôre sealed in plastic they are protected from leaking shampoo bottles, and odors from other items packed in the same suitcase!You‚Äôre gonna love these vacuum bags as much as I do. Highly recommended! Update: If use the bags on several trips for over a year, and continue to get excellent compression performance from them. However, one bag seal has failed, which I‚Äôm disappointed about, but nothing lasts forever. I will continue to use the bags, and I still highly recommend them for the benefits they provide .', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States March 2, 2018', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars These definitely came in handy for a ten day trip', 'author': 'ebnatl', 'rating': 4, 'content': ""These bags made it very easy to get the requisite amount of clothes into my checked bag without overage fees.

Quality construction, Great design, EXCELLENT ZIPPER...made me a BELIEVER in PACKING CUBES!!', 'author': 'MightyDwighty', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Pros:- Quality build- Excellent zipper quality and durability- Strong seams- Lightweight- Open netting design allows for visibility of contents and easy compression- Attractive but simple colors and design- Comfortable zipper pulls- Comes with sack to carry all the packing cubes and can alternatively be used as a travel laundry bag- 4 packing cubes for the price of many competitors offering 3- Excellent customer serviceCons:- Nothing major at the moment, but I am starting to notice after a few months of use that some of the seams appear to be stretching a little too far and am concerned that it may tear after a while- The plastic spring cord lock used on the sack that carries all the packing cubes (I used the sack as a ""dirty laundry bag"") broke after a monthPersonal Experience:Ask me a year ago whether I would ever have packing cubes and I would have scoffed at you and declared that it was illogical to try to save packing space by using packing cubes that forced the cube shape. Now...I\'m a believer!!Packing cubes have changed the way I packed forever. Not only does it organize everything I pack (underwear, socks, pajamas go in one; shirts and pants go in another, etc), it allows me to pack 2-3 times more than I used to be able to because you are able to squeeze everything into a packing cube and then zip it up. Packing cubes don\'t add any appreciable weight to your luggage because they are so lightweight anyway. And for longer trips, I simply take out my packing cubes from my duffel bag/suitcase and they serve as drawers for all my travel items.In terms of Shacke Pak specifically, I referenced in my ""Pros"" why I think Shacke Pak is generally superior to other brands. In particular, I received one packing cube that had an issue with the zipper that resulted in the zipper handle breaking pre-maturely. I contacted Shacke Pak and customer service immediately sent me a replacement packing cube without any hassle. I am very pleased with the customer service and it has given me some measure of confidence that they will continue to take care of their customers in the future.**Update: I also own two sets of eBags packing cubes (you can read my other reviews) and have had the opportunity to compare them directly to Shacke Pak. In all honesty, both brands make exceptional packing cubes and you really wouldn\'t be disappointed either way. But to be nit picky, I will share a few of my observations:- Shacke Pak uses a material with a matte finish compared to the more shiny honeycomb design of eBags. The Shacke Pak material stretches ever so slightly, whereas the eBags material has very little give. As a result, it appears that the material eBags uses is slightly more durable, but Shacke Pak looks slightly more premium.- Shacke Pak uses hidden stitching beneath the zippers, whereas eBags uses a double stitched design in most places. After owning the Shacke Pak packing cubes for about a year, I am noticing that the hidden stitching under the zipper pulls a little more and actually becomes visible when I pack the cubes tightly. This concerns me slightly and makes me question the long term durability whereas eBags\' double stitched design seems to hold strong regardless of how tightly I pack the cubes.- The depth of Shacke Pak packing cubes is .75"" to 1"" more, so you can pack more.- The zipper pull handle (not the zipper itself) on one of my packing cubes from Shacke Pak fell off after one month. I contacted Shacke Pak and they immediately sent me an entire new packing cube. Shacke Pak demonstrated excellent customer service, but at the same time I am a little concerned that something like that happened so quickly in the first place. Since then, I have had no issues with my two sets of packing cubes from Shacke Pak. I have had no issues with eBags in terms of the zippers or zipper handles in the 6 months that I have owned them.- Shacke Pak packing cubes gives you 4 for the price of approximately 3 from eBags. Also, Shacke Pak includes a pouch with the packing cubes that can be conveniently used as a dirty laundry bag when you\'re travelling. You seem to get a little more for your money with Shacke Pak.- Zipper quality for both is excellent, as they both use YKK zippers.- Overall: You can\'t go wrong with either and each brand has slight advantages over the other in a few areas. I personally think eBags is slightly more durable, but that Shacke Pak is slightly more attractive and gives you a little more for your money.Conclusion:If you are looking for a high quality and durable set of packing cubes for travelling, you really can\'t go wrong with the Shacke Pak set. The price is reasonable and you get 4 packing cubes for the price of what most competitors charge for 3. I have not had any real issues with quality or durability (I travel and use these a lot, but I will update my review in the future), and Shacke Pak has already demonstrated to me that they have excellent customer service. I also think the Shacke Pak packing cube set provides one of the most stylish designs compared to the others out there.**I have included a picture of one my packing cubes when it is packed tightly showing what I mean about the hidden stitching being stretched and visible. This concerns me a bit.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 30, 2015', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': ""5.0 out of 5 stars If you haven't purchased packing bags before I would highly recommend them!"", 'author': 'Loni', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I had a friend recommend packing cubes when she heard my husband, two year old, and I were going to Europe for two weeks and staying at 6 different hotels. I looked at a variety of options when typing in ""packing cube"" and finally decided on the Shacke Pak brand and Bago brand.I chose the Shacke Pak brand because I liked that it offered four different sizes and it being my first time purchasing these I wasn\'t exactly sure what sizes to get. I also liked that with Shacke Pak it came with a laundry bag, which definitely came in handy, because there were times we got rained on all day and with our full packed trip and we didn\'t have time to find a washer and dryer, so it was nice to separate some of our dirty clothes in the laundry bag. I also really liked the biggest size that it came with and was able to pack almost all of my clothes in just the biggest size for a two week trip!The reason I chose the Bago brand was because I liked that you had the option to choose all of one color or two different colors. I also liked that it came with 6 organizer bags which I used to put our liquids in, incase they leaked. The organizer bags are a lot thicker than your regular ziplock bag, which is what I have usually used, so these will last a lot longer, and there are multiple sizes, so I could separate our toothbrushes and paste in one and soaps and lotions, etc. in another. I also used them to put chargers and adapters in, so they were all together.Overall, between the two brands, as far as durability goes, I honestly didn\'t notice much of a difference. They are both really thin and light, so they don\'t take up any extra room in your suitcase! We had them packed full, (especially on our way home) and we didn\'t have any problems with them! They served their purpose and if or when I need more I will definitely purchase again! Shake Pak was a little more expensive than Bago. I believe I paid $21.99 for Bago and $29.99 for Shacke Pak. I really like the biggest size that came with Shacke Pak, the Bago ones I purchased only offered two sizes that were the two middle sizes offered from this Shacke Pak purchase.Also, I should mention, I purchased brands different from what my friend recommended because these were half the price and honestly, I loved both of them and thought they were very durable. I can\'t say enough good things about packing bags and I don\'t know how I ever lived without them! We took one big suitcase, because with a toddler, we needed one person to have free hands when traveling between hotels. In our big suitcase, we packed all four of the Bago bags, and then the 3 biggest Shacke Pak bags. So, that\'s 7 packing bags, stuffed clear full in one big suitcase for a two week trip across Europe. We each used two bags, and then used one bag for liquids and accessories like chargers. And on our way home, we had the laundry bag half way full, with the 7 bags clear full and we were still able to zip our suitcase up! Also, each bag comes with a handle, and we packed them so the handles were on top, so we could grab our bag out of the suitcase by the handle!On our way across Europe we picked up many souvenirs that we rolled up with our clothes, so we were able to fit even more stuff in our suitcase! These were so convenient too, because each of us had a different color, so when we needed something, rather than making a mess of the whole suitcase trying to find it, we would grab the color of bag for that person! Prior to this, I would end up repacking the suitcase every time we moved locations, so, if you are debating whether or not to get Packing Bags, I would recommend you make the purchase! These are a time saver and space saver! It is so convenient to just grab your bag and put it in the dresser at the hotel, rather than all of your clothes, and they beat repacking your suitcase every time you move locations, or even just when you\'re leaving to go home.Overall, the Shacke Pak brand was great, we liked the variety of sizes (especially the biggest size) and that it came with a laundry bag.

I either like the product or I don't. I have now had the Shacke Pak for a little over two weeks and have really started to put them through their paces. A little about me. I travel somewhere around 100,000 miles per year. That's over 100 flights, a ton of car rentals, in and out of hotels. I wear luggage out! A computer bag typically lasts me 6 to 9 months. Even really expensive carry-on suitcases and packing cubes wear out after two years. I have been using another very well respected and recognized name (Eagle Creek) for the past 4 years, but they are now reaching the end of their life. So, I started looking for a replacement. I naturally went right for the Eagle Creek, but, saw some reviews on the Shacke Pak and felt like I wanted to give them a try. Because I have had so much experience with travel items, I can tell within a week how a bag or travel item is going to do. My new Shacke Pak‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. I have a solid feeling that it is going to be with me a long time! This past week, I took the three smallest cubes with me on a four day trip to the Midwest. I went carry-on, so they were stuffed to limits. I have to say..... they stuff well!Having use packing folders for the past few years, I was not expecting them to hold as much or condense as much as what I could get into my Eagle Creek packing folder. I also was convinced that I would not like the cube as much as the folding pack. I was wrong. They held just as much and they held everything well. The dimensions of each packing cube are just about perfect. There are four cubes in the pack, small, medium, large and extra-large. My carry-on is on the smaller size, so I skipped using the extra-large. In the large, I put in two dress pants, three dress shirts, and a polo. I saved the medium for my laundry as I used clothes (each night in a new hotel means I had to pack laundry into the same bag and I did not want my dirty clothes touching clean clothes). In the small, I put 4 pairs of socks, a t-shirt, four pair of underwear and pair of shorts and a work-out shirt. All fit nice. I tossed the packing cubes in my bag and still had room for my suit coat to lay across the top and my winter jacket shoved in too. All fit! Best part...... wrinkles were minimal. Zippers and stitching are top quality. The mesh 'window' is nice. I like that the 'window' is small and a majority of the bag is the stronger and heavy-duty material. That helps it hold it's shape better in my bag and also makes packing items in the pak easier. I got the black and blue... really like the look.So what does this all really mean? It means if you want advice from someone who has over a million flight miles, a hundred nights in a hotel a year, and who has seen almost every inch of the globe and knows how to pack..... buy these cubes! I am super picky about the organization of my things when I travel. I go carry on (I can go ten days in a carry-on bag) so getting everything I need into a small bag, in a way that I can get to my clothes easily without having to unpack and repack everyday is important to me. I am the person who will spend two weeks moving items from one pocket in a suitcase to another just to maximize space and convenience. I can tell you, I have gone through dozens of suitcases, half a dozen folders and cubes, more than a few dozen briefcases and computer bags.....the Shacke Pak is one of the best investments I have made in travel products. I will be purchasing a set for each member of my team as I know they will appreciate them as much as I do!I have a new name for packing cubes. Shacke Pak. Better quality, better price, and more effective than the other big named cubes and folders.FYI - - I researched the company and the product for many weeks leading up to the purchase.....

Fits under the seat. The suitcase configuration is nice & the wet pocket is a nice addition. Found the backpack comfortable and aesthetically pleasing. However; the shoe pocket can really only be used with sandals or if the main compartment is nearly empty. I love the color (I got peacock blue) and the material feels a bit hydrophobic, so it‚Äôs easy to wipe down. I haven‚Äôt put it in the washing mashing but a friend confirmed that the USB port was still functional after the backpack was washed. I also appreciated the padding on the back and the ‚Äúsecret‚Äù compartment against the back to prevent passport theft.If you travel frequently you might want to go with something higher quality. But this pack is good for the price.This backpack would be a lot better if it included:Higher quality straps. The straps look and feel a bit cheap. The stitching does not appear too sturdy and will definitely begin to separate quickly with consistent use. I used mine once; and it already started fraying. A handle on the side of the bag, allowing for it to be carried briefcase style and a larger (or maybe two?) water bottle sleeves would be great.A loop or two for hanging keychains on the outside of the back. Doesn‚Äôt seem important until you need a place to hang a hat or a neck pillow.Most importantly this backpack needs a better configuration for the laptop pouch & the two slim front most pockets.The laptop compartment doesn‚Äôt have a sleeve or strap, it‚Äôs just one slim pocket. That isn‚Äôt a big deal, but it would be nice if the laptop pocket could be opened suitcase style for TSA/customs purposes. If the laptop pocket had a clear sleeve / Velcro strap like most backpacks & if the pocket could be opened full length, you would not need to remove the electronics from the backpack.Finally, the most inconvenient feature on this backpack is the complete lack of quick access pockets. There is literally not a single pocket you can easily drop your phone or wallet into. If the front of the backpack had a full access arched zipper pocket, even if it was super thing it would be SO helpful. A few mesh organization pockets (like in the main compartment) and an attached key ring inside the front most pouch would go a long way.So overall, get this backpack for casual travel as a budget option.

It\'s not perfect, but it was the best all-around bag I could find as of now.Good: I really like the top little passport/ticket pocket. It\'s easy to get to whether carrying the bag around or having it strapped to your carry-on. The size is really good. You can carry larger backpacks as personal items on some airlines, or even use the larger ones as carry-ons themselves. But if you\'re looking to maximize your ""personal item"" and want it to conform to pretty much all, including the more strict European airlines, this is the size you need. I found I liked the side handle as much as the top one. Sometimes it was just easier to tote it around like a briefcase, and this one can do that... most don\'t, and instead have another water bottle holder. The quality of construction was decent. The zippers were smooth, the canvas-like material was sturdy enough. It looks like a good back pack. Aesthetically, it has zippers going across and down in front and breaks up the space visually. Some bags just look like a flat surface, which for me is a bit dull, so I like the look of the bag. That\'s a completely subjective take though. I liked how the bag opened like a suitcase from the front. It was easy to pack and get stuff out. What was unique to this bag was that it opened folding to the side rather than at the bottom end. It feels more like a suitcase than any other bag I checked out, specifically because of this feature. Others felt like a backpack that just peeled all the way down to the bottom instead of half way.Where they could make the bag better: The material was fine, but some bags come in a material that is a little more bullet proof so to speak (perhaps polyester)... they seem a little more water resistant/scratch resistant. I\'d pay to upgrade to that material. The quality of the zippers and straps are decent, but there are better ones out there. I had one bag where the zipper was super smooth and a bit sturdier, but the bag was way to big for my needs. The straps on one bag (Hynes Eagle) were more securely sewn in/attached at the top and under the straps it wasn\'t the breathable pad that many of the backpacks have, which seem vulnerable to snags, it was just a more durable strap all together. I wanted to take those straps and put them on this bag. And finally one bag (Beraliy Travel Backpack) had a zipper near the top where you could unclip the bottoms of the straps and tuck the straps into a pouch at the top, completely concealing the straps altogether allowing the bag to look even more like a briefcase style carry-on when you want. I would choose that option over the snaps this bag uses to secure the straps when in briefcase mode. This sounds like I\'m being a bit critical of this bag, but I did like it. It definitely served its purpose. Other bags in this size had less, and bags that had more were too large... they became carry-ons which isn\'t what I needed. A couple more nit-picky things... I liked the water bottle holders on some other bags better. This has a stretchable cloth which is functional and better than some that had mesh ones. I wonder how it will hold up down the road. Others had a pouch made of the same material as the bag with elastic straps to keep it tightly held to the side of the bag when not in use. I liked those a bit more. Some bags had a zipper at the bottom giving access to a pouch for dirtier things like shoes. While it does take up space inside the main compartment, if you decide not to use that bottom pouch, it doesn\'t take up any space. So having something like that added to this bag would give it a little more versatility. And finally some bags had a secret pouch stored on the backpack where the bag is pressed against your back when you\'re carrying it, which would make it nearly impossible for someone to pickpocket that compartment. That would be an easy enough addition to this bag. But thats a place where you put some cash/id when you\'re not in the airport. While in the airport the top zipper pouch on this bag is soooo useful. And there are bags with an expander zipper, which is great if the bag is going to be your primary carry-on... not as useful for a personal item bag, as you can\'t deploy that extra size without changing the status of the bag. It would be a feature that would make a bag like this more flexible for different uses without taking away from its use as a personal item, so that would be worth considering if remaking this bag. I haven\'t found the perfect bag yet. But this one is a really good one for it\'s intended purpose of being a ""personal item"" bag. Decent quality, opens like a suitcase (it really feels like a mini one) zippers in the convenient spots, can carry it different ways, aesthetically pleasing, and not just the right size for all airlines, but also great for slinging into an uber that\'s taking you to the beach, or to hike a castle. It\'s not too big to be a burden when you\'re out and about... easy to slip under a table at a cafe, without looking like you\'re headed to the airport.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 8, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars It is the correct size for PERSONAL luggage on all air lines.....

It's lightweight and compact enough that I could fold it up and keep it in my pack while hiking, but huge enough that I could throw my backpack into it along with all of my gear, and still have room to spare. It was really difficult to carry around the airport when so heavy, but it was a price I was willing to pay. My boyfriend didn't think this bag was a good idea and bought a bag specifically made for air travel with backpacks, and his had no handles so it was impossible to carry and also ripped, so he won't be using it again. My bag came through the whole trip and both flights in pristine condition, and I now use it all the time to go between home and college when I don't have time or am too lazy to pack nicely. I throw everything and I'm good to go. I've never run out of room with this bag!Now, a year later, we are buying this bag again (in the same pretty turquoise color) because my family had an exchange student this year and she needed another suitcase to bring home all of the clothes and belongings she acquired this year. She had no idea what to do because she needed something roomy and very lightweight so she could take as much as possible home without exceeding the weight limit, and she didn't want to spend $100 on another suitcase.

They stuff inside of a their pocket and measure approximately 8x10x2. EMS\'s bag is $49 and 38"" long. REI\'s bag is $29 and 36"" long. After purchasing both I found the Samsonite Tote-a-ton and returned the more expensive bags. The tote-a-ton is cheap in $ but not in quality. The durable material is the same as the more expensive duffles with two sturdy handles to lift. There\'s outside pocket and inside pocket, too. I have an Osprey Aura AG 65L. The pack is approximately 31 inches long. It fits perfectly into the duffle with room to spare. I haven\'t actually packed the backpack but feel confident it will still fit into the duffle. I am packrafting in Alaska this summer. I need something that will safely get my backpack and gear to Alaska. While in Alaska I will use my backpack for day trips/rafting and my gear will go into the duffle which will be hauled, by the outfitter, to the next location. Perfect solution! Plus, in the future, when I travel and don\'t need the duffle, it collapses perfectly and can be stuffed into my pack without taking up a lot of space. I have a friend traveling to Nepal in March. I showed her the duffle and she\'s purchasing one to protect her backpack, too. Great deal. We\'ll see how it holds up in June and I\'ll report back then :-)UPDATE July 14, 2015:I just returned from my 10 day trip to South Central Alaska. The duffle was perfect for this trip! Just like I mentioned above...the duffle protected my 65L when I checked it on the plane and then I used it to store my gear and clothing while using my backpack for packrafting during the day. The placement of the zipper made the bag easy to get in and out of. I\'m not sure how well the material will continue to hold up because it is rather light weight. It was pretty dirty after being checked on the plane. I don\'t travel regularly so it may be a while before it gets used again. However, the light weight factor can be a plus if you are backpacking and have to stow the duffle in your backpack. I\'d still highly recommend it!', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 13, 2015', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Will purchase again!', 'author': 'Amazon Customer', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'This bag is more roomy, beautiful and durable!

I purchased several of these duffle bags to use when moving from one state to another. While a professional moving company took all of my furniture and household items, I had to live in temporary housing for a few months in my new city after starting a new job, so had to bring a substantial amount of my clothing, including my professional work wardrobe of many suits, dresses, etc., with me in a car that I was driving to my new city. I also needed to be able to contain my clothing somehow in interim housing for a few months, as there was no closet space for my clothes. These duffle bags worked perfectly. They fit an incredible amount of clothing. I also used them to store all of my sheets, down comforter, bed pillows, towels, and winter coats, which also fit perfectly. They are much, much larger than you can appreciate from the photograph. I was so pleased with these duffle bags that the next time I moved, across town, I purchased more of these instead of using cardboard boxes, as these duffle bags are easy to move and carry. They also stack well on top of each other.While they were perfect for my needs, I wouldn't recommend purchasing them if you need a large bag to use traveling, however, or if you need to carry items that need to be protected from bumps. The fabric is very thin, like a thin running windbreaker, or a parachute, which I don't believe would hold up if you used one of the bags to backpack through Europe with, for example, or if you needed to transport fragile items without breaking.

Stec', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'This bag is unwieldy to carry and unsexy to look at. There are more glamorous ways to get your stuff where you need it to go, but as many others have stated, this bag is a great way to fit all of your stuff and to maximize the airline weight and dimensions requirements without additional fees.We flew United Basic Economy to go camping in a state park and wanted to pay for only one checked bag between two people. Note that no US airline sans Southwest offers a free checked bag in Basic Economy or Economy, and budget airlines have an even lower weight threshold for your paid checked bag (40 lbs on Spirit and Allegiant vs. 50 lbs on the major airlines). Buying this Samsonite duffel and paying for one checked bag on United saved us over $30 vs. paying for two bags, and we got something we can use on future trips instead of just throwing that additional money away.On this trip, the bag weighed 49 lbs and contained: two sleeping bags, two inflatable sleeping pads, a tent, an Eno hammock, a Windpouch inflatable couch, a first aid kit, two toiletry bags, two towels, one blanket, and a 22"" backpack duffel that held all our clothes and shoes. The bag was maximized and we could not have used something smaller without taking two bags, and the lightweight construction meant we were still underweight.And the best part? Because this duffel folds up easily, I stuffed it inside another suitcase when we got home so that it wouldn\'t take up extra space in the closet. I highly recommend this bag for anyone who needs to travel with a lot of stuff. When you don\'t need to carry that much, then use it as a zippered cover to protect your nicer checked luggage from the battleground of baggage claim. It\'s cheap enough that you will make your money back quickly.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States July 11, 2019', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great for carrying lots of stuff once or twice - maybe more - when moving to another land', 'author': 'KV Trout', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""Like another reviewer I used 2 of these to move internationally. I bought 2 and they arrived in good order. I used a little screw-and-nut type metal lock thingie to keep the zippers locked. AND a caribiner so if one failed the other would still work. I'd say the biggest risk was that the zipper itself would actually break and everything would spill out.However this did not happen and I suspect it is made well enough that it is unlikely to happen. Next time though - just to be sure - I'll try to find a way of wrapping it all in plastic. Some airports offer this service and if not maybe some local business does? Anyway this would be ideal, or at least wrap it with some straps to keep it closed in case it comes open. Again I don't know that this is likely to happen - it did NOT happen! - but I think it's a good idea to take a preventative action just in case.I am buying 2 more for taking more stuff in the future. As it turns out, carrying extra baggage - at least on some airlines and some types of tickets - is much cheaper than paying for shipping internationally.I wonder if these will hold up well on many trips. They might.______I am using these as one-time vessels to carry stuff to store in another country until we get our home built. So I don't know how they hold up over multiple uses.However I will give you some tips:1. You can use a cardboard box or light plastic box inside in the middle to protect fragile items then pack clothes etc around and on top of the box, on each end and on sides. This is what I did and the items seem to have arrived undamaged.2. You can use bunjee cords or go to Goodwill and buy old belts to strap around the bags. I used one on each side of the handle, (where you see the vertical stripes) dividing the bag into thirds more or less. I had no problem on the bags I did not do this with, but I think it's even better with the straps.3. I used key rings to close the zippers together then also added another 2nd wire or fastener so the zippers are doubly fastened. The zippers are the weak link of this item I think; however it has NOT been a problem so far.4. I include some wire or very strong twine at the top of the bag, inside, so that if it comes open a helpful airline person MIGHT figure out that they can fasten it with the included twine/wire. I even put a note saying that is what it was for inside."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 7, 2015', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Holds a ton of stuff', 'author': 'Gary Rosenfeld', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'Don‚Äôt let the size fool you this bag holds a ton of stuff.

This resulted in air slowly seeping back into the bags, negating the space-saving benefits of vacuum sealing. Unfortunately, this occurred after the return window had closed, leaving me unable to seek a replacement or refund.Despite the initial setback, when the bags did hold up, they were effective in compressing and storing items such as clothes, blankets, and pillows. The inclusion of both jumbo and large sizes was convenient for various storage needs.Overall, while the Cube Vacuum Storage Bags have potential, the issue of leaking or getting holes after the first use was a significant drawback for me.

They don't all fit, so I have to find other places to store these bulky items.With the vacuum bags, I would say they reduced the size of these items by 50%, and in the case of the pillows, 75%. I was able to fit all but one vacuum bag in the two drawers. For perspective (and I should have taken a picture, but I was too excited to squish everything down and get them into the drawers) I have 2' x 3 1/2' x 1 1/2' drawers. All full. Plus, I had a stack of items on the couch that towered over the back of the couch by about 6 to 8 inches. What these items were: 2 California king oversized quilts, 3 California king waffle blankets, 3 California king fuzzy blankets, 21 set of California king sheets (all folded), 2 small pillows and one king sized memory foam pillow. One set of sheets I had run out of the smaller bags for, but there's, now, enough room not to squish them down.Before I started, the drawers were full, I had the stack on the couch, still, to put somewhere, and a blanket on the floor in the bedroom. Now, the drawers are full, and I have one bag with one wafdle blanket and one fuzzy blanket in it that just won't fit in the drawers. So, I fit about double what I had in the drawers.Of note is that the bags are heavier when you are able to squish them down to a smaller size. So, if your boxing things away, be sure to double check the heft of the boxes. Using the smaller sized bags helps more with that. If you use the larger ones, and leave a space in the middle, you can fold the vacuumed bag over, so that it isn't one giant bag.The other thing is that you don't want to do a whole bunch at a time. You need to give the little vacuum thingy a rest. It can do a couple of big bags in a row, but it starts warming up, so maybe do 4 bags and then give it a breather.One other thing that I did like about these bags was the fact that they came with little zip sealers. It takes a bit to get them on, but it saves your fingers and time when you're trying to get the bag sealed in order to vacuum."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2023', 'is_verified': True}]"

In-stock changed from mid-February to within a week of when I needed it, so I snatched up the Large to compare. I\'ve tried to leave the kind of detailed, honest review I\'d appreciate elsewhere, so please pardon the length!-------SIZE-------Sizing is a bit misleading but in a good way!! Specs might make you think there isn\'t too much difference between the M and L, but as you can see from my photo there\'s quite a lot of room in the Large! Seller, I\'d recommend sharing measurements for both the inside capacity and side pouches. Side pouches are listed as being the same size for both the M and L, but the L\'s are correspondingly bigger. I travel every single weekend and have a HUGE TON OF SH*T to carry around all. the. time. The only items that are missing from the photo are small silicone squeeze tubes for conditioner, body wash, lotion, and my Sonicare toothbrush, which is housed in a bulky traveling/charging case. Even so, I am confident all of those items will fit!------QUALITY & DESIGN-------Although there is a lot of space in the ""roll out"", be aware that when zipped it may be pretty slim and tight (see photo). However, honestly that seems to be the case with most travel toiletry bags - it\'s not like there\'s a secondary ""expanding"" zipper like there is for luggage! The fabric is a heavy-duty synthetic material with little stretch, but items seem to shift when fully packed up to accommodate. BUT the handles seem to be attached with pitch black thread, so it is visible when the bag is full (see photo). Time will tell if it continues to unravel or this becomes an ugly problem or not. Not sure why the manufacturers decided on this detail. Personally, I chose this bag because it is very cute (reminds me of Victoria\'s Secret shopping bags) AND the STRAPS ARE THE SAME COLOR AS THE MAIN BODY. There is a similar bag on Amazon with pink stripes, but the zipper and top handle are a brown leather color. It has a better front pocket than this one since it snaps closed (and this one is open so don\'t put your wedding ring in there or it may fall out - see photo) but I liked this design so much better.Have only used it once and nothing busted open or leaked, so can\'t attest to the leak-proof feature.

There are also straps inside to hold bottles that i didnt even realize at first. Now when traveling using the handle, you're going to zip it up and one side of the bag will potentially be upside down so make sure your bottles are capped tightly. It does indeed have a hook at top so it can be hung which is super useful :)This bag would be great for skincare, hair accessories, or anything else thats small that you could think of. My only complaint is that when it arrived, it had no overwrap so it was literally just a clear, thin plastic with the bag inside. I feel like it could easily be damaged this way, so i hope amazon changes it from SIOC to at least putting a little overwrap to protect the item.I think this would make a great gift as well.

I purchased this for showering purposes after my workouts. ""Waterproof"" side to hold my phone and non to hold all my toiletries. After my shower this morning, I noticed a good amount of water where my phone was zipped in. Luckily for me, my phone has its own waterproof case but that ""waterproof"" side failed what the description claims. I inspected the bag; no holes.. inspected the zipper and it doesn\'t zip all the way.. leaves a small hole at the end just big enough to allow water to get into and there\'s no way of tightening it. Brought it home and performed a test via video. Turns out it\'s not the hole that caused the leak in its entirety but bad zipper mechanics that\'s allowing water to enter. Now, I know a few people may advise to just place it away from the shower and that\'s too obvious. Unfortunately, the gym facility doesn\'t provide an alternate area to hook this onto. Beside that point, fact being, it IS advertised as waterproof and should hold up to that regardless where this bag is placed. It\'s the meat of the reason why I bought this in the first place. It\'s not even condensation proof! Had it in my gym bag while I was at work and the heat from my workout clothes and moisture from my towel caused a significant amount of condensation in the waterproof pocket. I, unfortunately, do not have proof of that.

So far I have no dislikes other than it‚Äôs slightly bigger than I expected but it‚Äôs not a deal breaker and honestly if given a choice I prefer bigger to smaller. What I like about the purse:1. The curve of the straps on the front is genius. Many cross bodies slide as you move and this one hugs your body keeping it in place.2. Thicker straps, I hate cross body‚Äôs that have slimy straps or straps that tangle up. These are solid straps that won‚Äôt dig.3. The middle zipper unzips all the way down the side of bag to really open if needed. It is also a locking safety zipper that is easy to open.4. Mini light is awesome, clips unobtrusively to key fob and you can clip your keys as well. And provides just enough light to see inside if needed.5. 4 rfid credit card pockets and larger passport space behind them.6. Plenty of interior pockets, one zip pocket, two pouch pockets one phone size other slightly larger, a pen slot and my personal favorite a lip balm slot.7. Exterior pockets: 1 larger back pocket, good size front pocket with safety locking zipper, big enough for large phone and also had another lip balm pouch, love it!!! And two magnetic pockets with flaps, one slightly larger than other. I can see using it for Kleenex, gum and other random smaller items.Overall I‚Äôm really impressed with the lightweight of this purse when filled. It‚Äôs comfortable and has plenty of room if you need to add a small e reader/iPad or book. I don‚Äôt usually carry those things in my purse but do like to have the option.

Always looks good.On usability- depends how you travel.I\'ve been on permanent travel for 5+ years now so here is my take on it. I\'ve had this bag for a little under 2 years now. - I wanted retro look and feel.- Gold or brass hardware.- Bottom compartment.- Sturdy handles.- Luggage insert pocket.This bag had all those things. It\'s very beautiful and I always get compliments.I bought a second bag so I could split my belongings:- 1 bag for clothes- 1 bag for housewares (kitchen, car, linens etc)If you can believe it, I packed for 3 people in the clothes bag= myself, husband and a baby.Top compartment fits 4 small packing cubes vertically for easy access and it\'s very useful.Bottom compartments fits 3 small packing cubes laying down, 1 cubes for each person and it fits perfect. The packing cubes were also from Amazon, https://a.co/d/8h3OIi3The square shape is useful because you can fit alot of clothes.However, that same feature makes it heavy.This is the only drawback. I wish it came in a smaller size so that I could maximize the space to fill its shape but not be so heavy.After 2 year, I finally took some pics while waiting for an uber at a Subway shop. You can see the wear and tear is minimal and no breaking has happened despite it being heavy.The handles are soft and have not ripped or failed.Bag has brass feet on the bottom and the zipper has never failed despite being full everyday for the last 2 years, both in the top compartment and the bottom compartment.If Baosha will make a 15"" or 16"" duffel just like this one, it would be perfect.

Overall Impression: These are decent travel laundry bags for the price I paid (which was just under $9 for two). I would return them if I had paid any more than I did. I don't think they will hold up well for regular or frequent use unless you're willing to do some minor sewing (or some other kind of modification to reinforce parts of them). They would likely last thru at least 1-2 small trips and may actually hold up to several uses each time before eventually falling apart or needing some amount of repair. Do not buy these if you absolutely do not want to take any risk of a seam coming undone and your laundry or other items spilling out. (But if you're willing to do some minor sewing, these bags seem like they could be pretty sturdy.)Material Quality: 5/5.Both the bag and handle fabric seem to be of good, strong quality. They're appropriate materiald for the size of the bag and the amount of laundry it is meant to hold. The black bag material feels a tad bit thicker than the gray bag. You can faintly see colorful clothing thru the gray bag in a decently lit room. However, the material is dense enough that you can't make out any graphic designs or stains on clothing. The draw string cord is thick, has a good length, and has a sturdy plastic push-button clasp on it. (Sorry... I'm not sure what those things are called. But they work well on both bags and don't seem like they'll fall apart with normal use. They keep the draw string top shut, but also tie the cord off as an extra precaution.) The zipper is okay. It's not heavy duty, but it's good enough for it's intended use, which is to contain the folded up laundry bag for storage or to hold very light items.Construction: 2.5/5.The sewing/stitching needs improvement in at least one important area. There is a very tiny part on both bags that is not sewn together at all (or hardly at all), which will likely cause the bags to fall apart quickly. The area is at the top of a side seam, located just under the drawstring opening. I noticed another reviewer mentioned this problem. So, I suspect this is a common design flaw and I didn't just get two faulty bags. This area definitely needed extra stitching to reinforce the top of the seam on both bags and to help hold together the draw string pocket on the gray bag. Luckily, I'm not to bad at hand-sewing and I happened to have the right supplies on hand. It was still a bother to have to take the time to fix these things. I'm also not sold on how much weight the bags can actually hold (with multiple use) based on overall construction. The bag handles seem sewn on well enough for light, infrequent use. But I feel an extra row of stitching could have been added to make them more secure.*I've included a video that show the problems I noted.Bag size: 5/5.One of these bags seems large enough for 3-7 days travel, depending on the time of the year and the size of the traveler. I'm a slender woman (Ht: 5'6, Wt: 115 lbs, usual clothing size is XS/S or a 4 in US womens). I was able to fit about 4 light winter outfits into one bag and close it without any hassle. (One outfit was basically equivalent to light to medium thickness denim pants, thin base layer leggings, underwear, bra, thick wool socks, a tank top or very slim fitting shirt, and a very oversized flannel or oversized medium thick sweatshirt.)Other possibly helpful info: I bought these bags intending to use them regularly as a space saving solution in a small home. (This is why secure handles were an important consideration for me.) I am currently hanging the bags by their handles from a slim bathroom door. I'm using these bags to store my dirty laundry in and to carry them to laundry room when full. (I have a hanging fabric laundry bag that is way larger than these ones, but it buldges out too far as it's filled. It's also not designed to be removed from the hangers and can be quite heavy when full.) I can hang both of these bags on a single door, one above the other, at convenient heights. However, they do buldge out when full since the fabric is thin and they don't have anything firm to keep them structured. They're convenient for sorting dark and light laundry into as I fill them up. I'll probably continue to find a better solution for my small space, but these work better than my previous laundry bag for now. These bags would also work well to hang from a bunk or loft bed given their size. A full bag can easily slide under my bed which has about 14 inch clearance underneath it. I have an extra large laundry machine so I may not want to wash a load of clothing until both bags are full. And I do sort my laundry by color and/or item type before washing, so I may look for other similar and cheap bags to purchase. These bags are a great size for traveling, in my opinion. I will definitely use them for that purpose once I find a better solution (and now that I've sewn them so that they're more durable).I don't think I'd buy these bags again... only because I don't want to have to take the time to inspect them and reinforce the weak areas. I may consider going thru the hassle again IF they end up holding up very well after several months of regular use, and I need some travel laundry bags for me and other family members."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 17, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great for travel', 'author': 'KelRelyea', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""We travel a lot, and there's always the problem of how to separate your clean and dirty clothes on longer trips.

The curve of the straps on the front is genius. Many cross bodies slide as you move and this one hugs your body keeping it in place.2. Thicker straps, I hate cross body‚Äôs that have slimy straps or straps that tangle up. These are solid straps that won‚Äôt dig.3. The middle zipper unzips all the way down the side of bag to really open if needed. It is also a locking safety zipper that is easy to open.4. Mini light is awesome, clips unobtrusively to key fob and you can clip your keys as well. And provides just enough light to see inside if needed.5. 4 rfid credit card pockets and larger passport space behind them.6. Plenty of interior pockets, one zip pocket, two pouch pockets one phone size other slightly larger, a pen slot and my personal favorite a lip balm slot.7. Exterior pockets: 1 larger back pocket, good size front pocket with safety locking zipper, big enough for large phone and also had another lip balm pouch, love it!!!

I really like the items packaged in this set. The cubes are all very useable sizes, the laundry bag is a little small, but good for weekender trips, and the toiletry is pretty decent to just dump toiletries in.I use packing cubes a lot when traveling, and I have both compression cubes (with the extra) and non-compression cubes (without the zipper). I can't say I prefer one over the other. The compression cubes make for easy pre-suitcase compression, but the non-compression cubes tend to just compress down and fill the gaps when you close your suitcase. Therefore, I don't see much difference in the total volume the suitcase can hold. I suspect it depends what you are packing. Probably the compression cubes help more with the bulkier items.The only thing I don't care for on these packing cubes is that the mesh fabric is a little stiff. It really doesn't make enough difference in the function to knock off a star for though.Just in general about packing cubes: They are really great for two scenarios. First, keeping your clothes organized when you have to live out of suitcase. It is kind of like having drawers in your suitcase for each type of clothing: shirts/shorts/underwear/etc. You can take the cubes out and lay them on the table and then quickly get them back in your suitcase when you need to pack up again. The second scenario is for when you are going on a multi-stage trip and don't want to unpack and repack your whole suitcase each stop. So for example you can put your clothes for day 1 and 2 in one cube, and only take that cube out of the suitcase at the first hotel.

Always looks good.On usability- depends how you travel.I\'ve been on permanent travel for 5+ years now so here is my take on it. I\'ve had this bag for a little under 2 years now. - I wanted retro look and feel.- Gold or brass hardware.- Bottom compartment.- Sturdy handles.- Luggage insert pocket.This bag had all those things. It\'s very beautiful and I always get compliments.I bought a second bag so I could split my belongings:- 1 bag for clothes- 1 bag for housewares (kitchen, car, linens etc)If you can believe it, I packed for 3 people in the clothes bag= myself, husband and a baby.Top compartment fits 4 small packing cubes vertically for easy access and it\'s very useful.Bottom compartments fits 3 small packing cubes laying down, 1 cubes for each person and it fits perfect. The packing cubes were also from Amazon, https://a.co/d/8h3OIi3The square shape is useful because you can fit alot of clothes.However, that same feature makes it heavy.This is the only drawback. I wish it came in a smaller size so that I could maximize the space to fill its shape but not be so heavy.After 2 year, I finally took some pics while waiting for an uber at a Subway shop. You can see the wear and tear is minimal and no breaking has happened despite it being heavy.The handles are soft and have not ripped or failed.Bag has brass feet on the bottom and the zipper has never failed despite being full everyday for the last 2 years, both in the top compartment and the bottom compartment.If Baosha will make a 15"" or 16"" duffel just like this one, it would be perfect.

As a frequent traveler and someone who values organized closet storage, these garment bags have become an essential part of my routine.First and foremost, the 5‚Äô‚Äô gussets on these bags are a game-changer. The extra depth provides ample space for suits, coats, jackets, and even bulkier clothing items, ensuring they remain wrinkle-free and well-protected during travel. This feature alone sets the garment bags apart from others on the market.The durability of the material is another standout feature. The bags are constructed with high-quality, breathable, and water-resistant fabric, which not only adds an extra layer of protection to my garments but also ensures they stay in pristine condition. The zippers are robust and glide smoothly, making it easy to access and store clothing without any hassle.What I appreciate most about these garment bags is their versatility. The design allows for easy hanging in closets, maximizing storage space and keeping my wardrobe neatly organized. The black color is sleek and modern, adding a touch of sophistication to my closet. You can also store/carry casual, dress, or loafer shoes, however, I would not recommend boots to be carried, and if you decide to then you can fit 1 shoe in one pocket thus only allowing you to carry a single pair of boots.The two-pack is a thoughtful touch, providing excellent value for the price. Having two garment bags has made packing for business trips or special occasions much more convenient. It's also worth noting that these bags are incredibly lightweight, making them ideal for air travel where every pound counts.In conclusion, the Garment Bags for Travel have become an indispensable part of my travel and closet organization. The thoughtful design, durable construction, and generous size make them a standout choice for anyone in need of reliable garment protection.

It removes are 5-6 times faster than the little USB and battery powered pumps offered on Amazon. See the photos for a comparisonI conducted 2 experiments, seeing how long it took to suck 2 different sets of bags completely empty of air:1 minute - A medium sized bag with one flat pillow in it5 minutes - A jumbo sized bag with 1 flat pillow, one extra large king size puffy pillow, 2 king size sheets, and a medium sized blanky.Pros: Very fast, extremely powerful, removes all air from the bag.Cons, large, bulky, heavy, and requires a proprietary DC wall adapter to power it. However, it was still able to easily fit in the side pocket of my backpack which I traveled with it on multiple international airplanes packed like this, and had no problems. It just adds a little extra bulk and weight.--- Review of Black, Removable USB Cable powered ---This was tied at the 2nd fastest pump, but significantly smaller and slower at removing air than the large pump.Using the same experiment:5 minutes - A medium sized bag filled the same as above28 minutes - A jumbo sized bag filled the same as abovePros: Small, lightweight, removable USB cable allows you to use a shorter or longer cable as desired.Cons: Very slow at removing air, compared to the large pump.--- Review of White, Attached USB cable powered: ---This was tied at the 2nd fastest pump, the exact same size as the small black pump.Using the same experiment:5 minutes - A medium sized bag filled the same as above28 minutes - A jumbo sized bag filled the same as abovePros: Small, lightweight, non-removable USB cable (can't lose it).Cons: Very slow at removing air, compared to the large pump, non-removable USB cable (can't use a shorter cable, but can make it longer using a USB extension cable).--- Review of Black, Battery powered ---This was the same size as the other 2 small USB powered pumps. It was very, very slow at removing air. I didn't conduct the same test, because I gave up due to how slow it is. However, it was probably the same speed as the 2 USB powered cables I tested, now that I realize how slow they are as well. It was about the same. I may try the test again in the future if I decide I want a battery powered pump.Pros: Battery operated, can run while charging, small, lightweightCons: Very slow at removing air, battery will eventually die after a few years.------------------------Overall, I am keeping the large pump for use at home, and I may even bring it with me on traveling. I like the idea of using a lightweight, 5 times smaller pump... but I don't like the idea of it taking 5 times longer to pack.The main reason is that usually I need to pack in a hurry when I'm traveling, to catch a flight or taxi somewhere. If I have to vacuum seal 5 bags with the large pump, it would only take me 2.5 minutes per bag on average (using a mix of small, medium, large, and jumbo bags), which nets me just under 15 minutes to pack all my bags.That same load would take around 75 minutes to pack using the small USB or battery powered pumps... which makes me unlikely to use them in reality. The only place I could use it being useful is on an airplane, since I like to bring pillows and blankys in the cabin. I could then vacuum seal it before unboarding the plane and pack it back in my carry on.This wasn't possible with the large pump due to the fact that it has a wall mounted power adapter, and the plane only offers USB power, or the proprietary plane jacks. I just resorted to manually laying on my vacuum bags and forcing the air out when unboarding the plane, which worked well enough to stuff it by force back into my carry on. A little USB pump would help make this process much easier, though, Lol. I suppose I could bring one of the manual hand vacuum pumps on board, even though they take a long of physical stamina, they work pretty rapidly and effectively.So, I haven't decided if I'll keep any of the little ones yet. It would be either the black USB powered, because of the replaceable cable, or Black battery powered if I do. Although, the white USB powered pump was just as good, but there has to be some deciding factor.I hope this review helps you in your selection of a nice vacuum pump!!"", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 21, 2019', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Works great.

This product travels well, small size on it's own so easy to include in my bag without making the situation worse. The vacuum bags also seem to close well and hold their seal. However, the suction leaves a LOT to be desired. At home, when packing, I can use the vacuum to really tamp the size down. But, once in the hotel, the suction machine is not very powerful so unfortunately I don't get the same results.

While this review is completely voluntary, and I wasn't compensated in any way for writing this, I will proudly say that you can't find a better shoe bag reviewer than me!Recently I realized that my shoe bags needed replacing, so I ordered a whole bunch of different kinds to try them out. These YAMIU Travel Shoe Bags are by far the best. They have a sturdy fabric loop that fits over a door handle, so you can load and unload your shoes without bending over - a big plus for tired athletes or anyone with back problems. When empty, they weigh next to nothing and take up almost no space. The fabric is very durable, and I have no doubt that it is waterproof (although I haven't tested it), and the fabric is thin and flexible so you can feel enough detail through the fabric to tell what shoes are in each bag (which is a handy feature when living out of a suitcase). I will have no qualms about tossing the bags in the washer when the time comes. The fabric has just enough stiffness so that it is easy to load the shoes, and it is a tad slippery so shoes don't stick to the bag when packing and unpacking. I'm thinking about putting rows of pegs on a closet wall and hanging these bags with shoes in them. I might leave the zipper open just a tad to see exactly what shoes are in each bag, or if not, the zipper is thoughtfully placed so that it easily zips open by pulling down when the bag is hung. The slippery and impermeable nature of the fabric will keep dust away from the shoes, and if they were hanging on a wall it would be super easy to dust the outside of the bags with a swiffer.It is obvious that YAMIU has carefully designed these bags for simplicity, functionality, durability and even a pleasurable aesthetic.

Style Comparison Review', 'author': 'Erin L. H.', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I have been looking for a more stylish and functional ‚Äúpersonal item‚Äù bag for traveling (primarily in cities) than the unstructured backpack I most often have been using for about 2 decades. This company has a bag that looks more geared for traveling as the main compartment splits in half like a traditional suitcase while still keeping the smaller backpack style, but it didn‚Äôt have the usb device charging port, which, as travelers often face while out and about, devices run out of battery from constant use. This feature was a big selling point for me as I‚Äôm usually carrying an external charger and cord in on of my jacket pockets and it‚Äôs a juggle! So unfortunately, the bag geared more for travel would have been great getting me to my destination, but it wouldn‚Äôt have been great as a day-backpack in that regard (plus the back splitting in half when you are adding things as you are out and about would have been awkward and inconvenient). Oh, and it didn‚Äôt have the tissue pocket, which was another brilliant feature I will DEFINITELY use. So even though most people are buying and reviewing the bags I purchased for work/school purposes, this review is for anyone looking for a great bag for travel. I ordered two styles as I really liked both and couldn‚Äôt decide. While I liked the look of the quilted bag more, I decided it wouldn‚Äôt serve my travel needs because all of those cute exterior pockets meant that the main compartment was a bit smaller. I believe the quilted is a 17 in and the other (the one I kept) is the 15.6. Neither is labeled in the tag or on my Amazon purchase list though, so I wish the company did a better job with that, but the difference isn‚Äôt enough to make a huge impact if you aren‚Äôt concerned about fitting a certain-sized laptop. Both bags have many similar features (like the USB port, lots of internal pockets, and the external tissue pocket), which was great. What I like about the bag I kept is that there is a frame of some sort around the opening compartment, so it locks open to a degree, making it much easier to pack as you don‚Äôt have to use one hand to always hold the bag open to pack and unpack. Because of that frame, when it is closed, it would be much more difficult to sneak open the main compartment by someone looking for an easy pickpocketing opportunity, and there is also enough room to attach a small lock to the main-compartment zippers for added security. The quilted bag had no possibility for this and could be unzipped and a hand quickly inserted if the wearer wasn‚Äôt paying attention. There isn‚Äôt a way to secure the three exterior zippered pockets on either bag. While the colors I chose will certainly get dirty quickly, it feels sturdy enough to spot clean. I may regret the color choice as the USB port makes it impossible to throw in the washing machine or fully soak, but I will have to cross that bridge when I get there. I really love the colors and that it will go with almost all outerwear I own. This bag (both bags) will fit easily under seat on a plane and still allow ample foot space. I used it for a 9 day visit to my sister, and am excited to use it on an upcoming international trip. There are lots of internal pockets, which is great for organizing your items (but also can make it difficult to remember where items were placed because there are SO MANY pockets.

Long review but tried to cover it all to help you. In the past I\'ve purchased several Travelon anti-theft products (wallet & crossbody bags) all SO heavy, hurt my shoulder, felt they were a waste of money. Needed RFID for recent trip to Las Vegas & was on the fence after watching a video review because I thought it was going to be too big & bulky, but measurements were smaller. Also several reviews said water bottle (16oz) didn\'t fit. Glad I took a chance at the last minute & it came in the night before my trip - happy it\'s not grossly ugly, shinny or old lady bag looking. Most of all thank you Travelon for improving the weight issue!!!Cons...The strap has 2 cables (stops cut & go theft) and it does get twisted now & then where it doesn\'t lay flay - easy fix, take off & put back on, could be improved with wider strap. It has 2 water bottle pockets on either end that un-zip with mesh - guess mesh supposed to stretch but doesn\'t (not a fan of the mesh) need to be careful when zipping it up. I could get 1 bottle in gently but 2nd bottle was too hard to deal with. I ended up using that one for my sunglasses. It was a bonus to have the bottle holder while walking around.Pros...Anti-theft & RFID but lighter weight! Plenty of space for long day trips & several pockets for organization but not overbearing. Like having the main compartment with open area & it zips up end to end. The big flap pocket has a latching zipper AND a magnet to keep the flap down, I found this very convenient for my phone since it was easy in/out all day. I used the ""credit card"" space for my hotel key-card & receipts (put small coin purse in this locking pocket too) Size was perfect size where I could keep on my lap while sitting too.Also, I purchased Travelon World Travel Essentials Set (RFID, 2 sizes zip ""coin purses"") small one for ID & credit cards, and used larger one put cash & earbuds. To carry small shopping bags hands free, I Attached a small carabiner to strap ring/hook. I was walking miles in 99 degree heat & wasn\'t uncomfortable with this nylon bag at all.

It works quite well for that. The nylon is nice and the shoulder strap gets plenty long enough to use as a cross body strap. There\'s a keeper for the looped end that makes it stay nicely. It is an attractive bag to wear and not huge for everyday use. Lots of interior pockets and an organizer make it good to keep things organized.The front pocket under the flap is a large single pocket with a zipper. The flap has a magnet on the long end that keeps in place when closed. The wallet organizer is on the back secured with a zipper and has a small wallet size pocket, a pen pocket and 8 card pockets in addition to the main pocket. Fits my aluminum wallet perfectly. A gusset on one side assists getting into it. My tablet with the keyboard attached slips in the center of the main compartment. I do have to move the interior pockets out of the way but it fits.It feels good on my body as the wide strap helps distribute weight and it isn\'t too wide to get in the way of movement. It will suit my uses pretty well. The side pockets are both the same to hold more stuff or a small water bottle. When zipped, tho they tuck completely out of the way for a slim and attractive fit.The anti-theft features are nice. Every zipper has a loop to secure it from adept thieves without some more action that probably could be felt. That said, it would be wise to wear it in front and not around the back in iffy situations. It is slim enuf to be comfortable wearing it in front.Things that could be better: The pockets and main entry are all a bit tight to access. Especially the back zipper wallet is tight. Altho it has a gusset on one side, it is a tight opening to access. Most purses have the zipper go down at least one side to help the access for this area.One side of the strap is looped thru a screw carbiner that is half in a sleeve. This is weird and I can\'t figure out what the purpose of it is. The other side is sewn so it isn\'t like you could detach the strap.It also isn\'t really a messenger bag.

The inner mesh pockets are nice and it includes a small zippered bag that is an added nice feature.Cons: The pocket to slip over a suitcase is too narrow to fit any of my Travelpro or LLBeam suitcases, so I don't think this bag is ideal for travel. It might suit your needs if you don't mind carrying it, but it would likely need to go in an overhead bin if stuffed full.

It's a light baby pink color, not too light or dark, a good shade. Makes it easy to find in bag as well as it looks good on a counter. Very pleasant neutral color for a pink shade.It arrived in a manufacturers box, sealed. Product was placed in an inside clear bag to protect it. There were no scratches or imperfections on this case. In the past, venders sent out items not wrapped which were made of the same material and had markings on it. This company took the time and care to properly package their item which I liked. Its very lightweight, super soft, and durableThis is a roomy holder. It's long also which I thought was a plus as I have several brushes and makeup tools that are on the longer side. There is a push button through hold closure which is great as you can adjust the closure width it you have alot of brushes or items inside. If you have a few, then the clasp can fit into a second hole that makes a tighter fit.Inside you can actually put makeup cleaner and scrub your brushes on the go. I have not used it in that capacity, but I have other silicone makeup cleaner pads that have similiar markings to help clean the brushes. This item as alot of markings to use for that, which go up the sides of holder half way. I bet this washes the brushes amazingly. Product dried quickly after initial washing and color stayed true.I can see this item being used for combs, small brushes, even hair scruchies. Its thickness is not chunky which is good, very streamlined for packing.

They do NOT leak just sitting on the counter, btw. However, leaking during a flight is NORMAL. The pressure changes within the plane and the liquids expand causing the leaks.However, I learned a simple trick that usually keeps liquids from seeping out. First, only fill the containers a maximum of 2/3 full. Then take a plastic bag and cut squares that will cover the threads where the tops screw on. (Any plastic will work, even grocery bags) Open the container and place this plastic square over the opening, covering all the threads. Then screw the lid over the plastic. This creates a better seal and usually keeps leaks from happening. In fact, I have never had a leak using this method.If you have a spray bottle, you simply remove the spray lid, and replace it with a regular lid.

The week prior, I had purchased the ""Travel Smart Travel Bottle Set‚Äù because it purported to ‚Äúconform with TSA guidelines‚Äù and be ‚Äúideal for shampoo, conditioners, hairspray, lotions, creams, etc.‚Äù Equally important is that it ‚Äúships from and sold by Amazon.com <http://amazon.com>.‚Äù I‚Äôve been an Amazon customer for over 15 years, and it has come to be my most trusted place to shop. And as an Amazon Prime member, I needed this kit to arrive fast as it was eligible for two day delivery, and so I chose this one. And boy do I regret it.I filled the bottles and jars with my liquids and gels and sealed them properly, placed them in the bag they came in, zipped it, and then placed my MacBook Pro laptop--which is my primary source of business and personal communication and work--in my carry-on backpack laptop sleeve. I then packed other important items, including this new travel bottle set, on top, so that I could take it out for TSA screening and it would not be crushed.I arrived in Miami and stayed at a friends‚Äô apartment on Miami Beach. The following morning, I woke up to start work on presentation that I was to give in a couple days, only to find that my computer screen was sticky and hard to open, and the computer was not on, which didn‚Äôt make sense, since the battery had been charged the day before. I tried to turn it on, and nothing happened‚Äîtotally dead. I showed it to my friends, and the husband discovered that there was something gooey in the outlets and portals, which smelled minty.This is when I realized that my new Conair toiletries bag, which I had removed the night before and noticed it was sticky on the inside, had leaked into the computer! I then inspected each container and noticed that my shampoo bottle, which I had properly sealed upon packing, had nonetheless leaked at least an inch of its contents, and one of the small containers with the twist-on cap, which had a liquid eye cream substance in it upon packing and closing, had almost completely drained out. These were the two most ‚Äúliquid‚Äù of my toiletries. The other creams seemed gooey enough to stay put in their jars, but not the actual liquids.This was a tragic but totally foreseeable incident on the companies part‚Äîthat is Amazon and Conair‚Äî where the toiletry bag is placed on top of everything else‚Äîwhere it should be--but the liquids leaked from their sealed containers, and then leaked through the zipped bag that nonetheless comes with gaps and small holes. This hole must have been situated exactly on top of my computer portals.So began an awful and expensive couple weeks of visits to the Apple Store in Miami Beach and the nearby Apple authorized dealer, Proatics, feeling too much pressure due to the extremely expensive diagnostic bill I‚Äôd been given to fix it ($1650 was the first estimate I received from the Apple authorized dealer, having diagnosed it as Stage 4 liquid damage that had fried everything but my hard drive, which he was thankfully able to extract before the shampoo reached it.) I gave my presentation as best I could, though was very stressed out and drained from this experience, having luckily emailed myself a draft of my presentation, which I was then able to do a cursory edit on a friend\'s computer. But beyond that I was not able to do other work throughout this time, and so have effectively lost three weeks in this mess.On Wednesday, April 11, I flew to the Twin Cities and made several visits to the Apple store there, trying to decide what was the best course of action. Their workers confirmed the stage 4 liquid damage from shampoo, but advised given the high cost of sending it to repair, that I replace the used and damaged machine with a new one.I contacted Amazon.com twice about this incident, including full documentation, and have received two cursory emails from their Executive Customer Relations person, Gabor Kiss, expressing sympathy but saying that it is not their responsibility, but Conair‚Äôs, and I must contact them. Kiss also refunded the $12 and change for the travel kit, and gave me a $30 (!) Amazon credit in response to my request for $2,417.58 of actual, documented expenses incurred to replace my computer. Kiss stated in his emails that to Amazon, ‚Äúproduct safety is extremely important‚Äù and they are ‚Äúreally sorry‚Äù to hear about this incident. But a $30 credit gives the lie to both those statements.I have since spoken with a corporate malpractice law firm, who looked at the case and advises me that given the well over 100 negative reviews that this product has ‚Äî which we have since gone back to read and I even sent them as attachments to Amazon ‚Äî that Amazon and Conair have been on notice for five years that this product ‚Äúleaks on the first time‚Äù, ‚Äúcracks‚Äù, ‚Äúran all over my bag‚Äù, ‚Äúopens in the air‚Äù, is ‚Äújunk‚Äù and ‚Äúothers be warned,‚Äù to quote just a few titles. Hundreds of customers have been diligent in documenting the dangers of this product, some even posting pictures.But what was Gabor Kiss and Amazon‚Äôs response? he wrote ""Reviews while helpful, may not speak towards the exact same manufacturing batch as your specific unit.‚Äù So in other words, it\'s a total crapshoot what you‚Äôre going to get with this product, despite it leaking over five years. Apparently Amazon feels no responsibility to pull a product that is clearly harming their customers, year after year, ruining their business trips and vacations, and putting their expensive electronics, important documents, clothes and other personal effects at risk each time we fly. Apparently Amazon (and Conair) have never heard of such a thing as quality control. Or products liability. And all the effort that we customers put into rating these products really doesnt matter to them, because nobody on their end is checking, or taking us seriously.Since this whole fiasco began, I and my family have refrained from purchasing anything from your company. They should pay for this well-documented damage, and yet they continue to dodge responsibility . Because of it, they have lost a very loyal customer, since I am now shopping online at Walmart, Barnes and Noble, iTunes, You Tube, etc. My family (and my lawyer) we surprised by their shady treatment. I have contacted Conair and we will see what they say. But Amazon buyers beware‚Äîthis company takes zero responsibility for the products it sells. Maybe they should have stuck to books, after all.A very disappointed, formerly loyal, ex-customer', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 7, 2018', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars The best for traveling', 'author': 'Amazon Customer', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'These Conair skin and scalp care travel bottles are perfect for your next trip or vacation.

It is as small as my other travel backpacks but it opens up to a really sturdy tote that's the perfect size and well-built enough for continued use. You would never guess a bag that gets as large as this one can become as compact as this can. Not only does it open into a nice-sized tote bag, but that tote bag also expands several more inches on the bottom! I'm SO happy with this! It has become my new weekender bag because it is constructed with enough quality for daily use. It has plenty of pockets and slots inside and out.

It was in its fully compact form, a 10x8x2 inch pack with an external zip area. The material of the bag is luxe, very sturdy. I got the green bag, it is a soft mint color, very pretty. I immediately opened the nylon zipper to reveal the largest size bag. Sturdy strap handles well sewn. Several storage options inside and out, and several zip areas. The outer pocket becomes an inner pocket on the other side with a flip and zip. A VERY inspired and unique design! I was excited to take this handy bag traveling or to markets or on trips... except for a fatal flaw.The zipper to transform this bag from the largest size to the smaller size is nylon. It is a LOT to zip, nearly twice around, and there is a lot of fabric to tuck away to keep it out of the zipper path. I zipped it about a third of the way around, and it would not go any further, and it wouldn\'t unzip either! I didn\'t want to force it and break the zipper, as my hands are not strong. So it was stuck, and I was frustrated. Husband was finally able to carefully free it, and I could zip it the rest of the way. Phew! A metal zipper, although it would add weight, would also add confidence in transforming the bag. Perhaps with use the extra fabric won\'t be a problem. But will the zipper hold up? The zipper becomes the bottom ""seam"", so it\'s taking all the weight of what you put in it at the smaller sizes. We shall see...You need the bag to be fully open to fold it back into its smallest form. So that zipper will get lots of use. It is a heavier nylon, but I think a metal zip would give more lifetime to the bag.Zipping it back into its smallest size is a bit confusing, and requires a lot of futzing to get everything folded and flipped and zipped. The photos help a little, but a video would be better, even if it\'s awkward and long.So if you are using this bag at its largest size only, I say it\'s amazing. At the next smaller size, only the zipper stands in your way. I didn\'t try the smallest bag size, I need to look at the photos again. It involves the snaps at the sides.Getting it back into compact travel square is a challenge that is worth it for travel.So although this bag needs a few changes, the basic design is incredible.

Arrives with the bottom already expanded to the larger size - when I tried to zip the bottom to shorten the bag, the zipper got stuck repeatedly and the whole process took me about ten minutes. As a result, I will not be expanding the bag again, but the shorter size works well for me. The stitching on the bag itself seems solid, and the material well made, with the exception of the handles, which look and feel rather cheap - thin and poorly stitched. The grip portion of the handles is just the handle doubled over itself, and they are not particularly comfortable to hold, but I don't have to carry it very far. The bag does not have a shoulder strap and the handles are a little short to be slipped over a shoulder. I do like the number of pockets, both inside and out - there is a spot for everything except for my water bottle. The bag was supposed to have separate wet and dry compartments, but the two compartments are starkly different in size and separated by only a thin divider that doesn't seem to be waterproof. To be on the safe side, I would line one compartment with a plastic bag for damp items.

Nice that it folds into it\'s own front pocket which then becomes a roomy front pocket when bag is unfolded. Note that with these type of bags, even though the base is wide, the top narrows near the zipper which limits capacity.What I don\'t like: The straps are too small to easily move the bag to hang on your shoulder (the more stuff in the bag, the shorter the strap length). I attached a photo showing the 6.75"" strap extension of this tote (measured from the top zipper when full) to the more generous 9.75"" of one of my favorite travel totes (blue print).

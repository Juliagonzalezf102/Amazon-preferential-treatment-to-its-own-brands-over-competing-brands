All the water is cleaned before it reaches the pump and has no place to gather and get nasty.This water fountain will be the last fountain I buy until I replace it with the same model. If it ever goes out of production I\'m going to buy 10 of them.The long version: I have 4 cats, 2 of which are very ""prissy"" cats. They would rather harass me for my glass of water than drink from a dirty fountain. The other 2 cats are sloppy drinkers and use the water fountain to clean their mouths out.I end up cleaning our water fountain every week, and other water fountains took different size nylon brushes and I would do so much scrubbing that I was worried about plastic in the water. I would also use 2 or 3 fountains to try and alleviate how quickly they would dirty.This Petkit water fountain comes apart in a few seconds, I use warm water and finger scrub, change the coconut filter as directed and all four cats love it as much the day before I clean it as the day after I clean it. They all drink healthy amounts and it keeps them from having expensive vet visits.Plus it\'s powered by an induction plate so I don\'t even have to unplug it to safely fill it or clean it. Just pick it up and carry it to the kitchen. And my cats get to play with the blinky light until I put the water fountain back so that\'s another win. 10/10, 5 stars', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 16, 2023', 'is_verified': True}]"

I'm Shocked How Good It Is!"", 'author': 'Ryan A. Leemhuis', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'A little background first. We had previously used the Crown Majestic feeder for our cat. It worked fairly well although it was a bit ugly, would occasionally jam and the portion sizes were very hit and miss. We used it until its power connection internally broke and it would only run off batteries which was difficult to keep up with.So that led me on my search for a replacement. There are a lot more options now than there used to be. My main features I was looking for were wifi control and reliability.I found it difficult to narrow down my choice as I found varying reviews and some claimed that a model was terrible and some said it was amazing. I eventually settled on the Petkit mini feeder from a cost and design perspective. First of all, it looks great. I love the thought that went into the design from the magnetically attached bowl to the jumper that allows the DC adapter to easily disconnect from the wall should you need. I was a little nervous about how much food could be stored but upon seeing the compartment this is a good amount for a cat. I find we need to fill it once every 2 weeks or so.That brings us to the worst part of the product. Lets just be clear here...the app is decent...but there are some language oddities and the setup did not go according to design. I am a techy and I initially tried pairing the feeder with my phone. It got fairly far into the setup but kept failing out during the wifi pairing process. I then tried my wife\'s phone and it did the same. I then happened to notice that the feeder was already showing on the app\'s dashboard and sure enough it had been paired even though the app claimed it had failed. I don\'t know why this occurred but be prepared for some setup issues.Once setup, however, the app is great. The food portion sizes are accurate and on demand feeds occur nearly immediately. The schedule is easy to setup and food is distributed on time. We use prescription ""disc-shaped"" food and other feeders claimed they weren\'t compatible. We have had ZERO issues with this machine getting jammed or having any issue with our food. It is actually very fun to watch the little door open on the machine and then the food dump out.For the cost, this feeder is a steal. It is so much better than our previous feeder it makes me wonder why I didn\'t upgrade earlier. My only suggestions for improvement would be to further improve the app and instructions translations. There are some real English oddities (which you can see in the product\'s amazon page as well. In addition, the setup process obviously needs some improvement too as it failed twice for me and some how magically appeared on my apps dashboard after this fail. Other than that, the feeder is perfect. It feels very high quality and the mechanics seem sound. HIGHLY recommended.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 29, 2019', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars PetKit Mini - Small Pet Feeder - Review', 'author': 'AirplaneCatBlue', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""The PetKit Mini feeder is attractively and elegantly designed. It looks like it belongs in an art museum.The PetKit Mini feeder is the ideal automatic feeder for my needs. What I like best is that it precisely delivers very small meals (as little as 1/20 of a cup or 5 grams) to my overweight cat up to 10 times per day. In my case I had been feeding my cat 20 grams of cat kibbles twice per day... or 40 grams. My cat was waking me up at 4 AM begging for more food. The PetKit Mini stopped the begging behavior! With the PetKit Mini I was able to schedule 8 feedings of 5 grams each... for a total of 40 grams per day... but spread out over the course of the day and night. This way my cat gets precisely fed her reduced ration and eliminates my tendency to give her a little extra when she begs.The PetKit Mini has improved my cat's relationship with me. She no longer relies on me for food. With the PetKit Mini she visits me often and regularly because she wants my company... not because she wants food. And it has improved my relationship with my cat since I am no longer irritated by her pestering behaviors at 4 AM when she gets hungry.The engineers who designed the PetKit Mini payed very close attention to critical details that separate this feeder from the pack. I studied them all before I made my purchase decision. The silicone rubber paddles that meter the kibbles into the rotary dosing cups are designed to flex so the kibbles don’t jam in the mechanism.The engineers used silicone rubber gaskets to seal out moisture at the feeding door and food reservoir lid. Then they provide a replaceable desiccant pack (those little packs that you often find in a box of new shoes) that absorb any moisture that might otherwise accumulate in your dried food. You can imagine that if your kibbles absorbed moisture from the air and swelled up like a sponge that they wouldn’t feed well in the mechanism. It also keeps the food fresher and prevents mold growth I would think.I found the PetKit Mini was easy to set up. It did help that I had an $8 electronic scale so I could better measure in grams how much I had been feeding my cat. I had been using a very small measuring cup. It was a lot easier to weigh the kibbles than to try to measure the volume of food.I measured the amount of food the PetKit Mini delivered with each feeding. I did this 8 times just to see how repeatable the feedings were. With my dry kibbles the average amount of each feeding was 4.97 grams. Pretty good if you were targeting 5 grams! (The standard deviation was 0.31 grams… who remembers what a standard deviation is???)Since I am only feeding my cat 40 grams per day the food reservoir is large enough for storing a 37 day supply. I can just check the food level once per month to be safe… but the PetKit Mini is designed with a monitor that will alert me when the food is low. What a great feature! It will also remind me every 30 days to replace the desiccant pack. I found some after-market desiccant packs on EBay that will fit the PetKit Mini because I couldn’t find any OEM packs online.This is a great automatic WiFI cat feeder! I liked it so much I bought a second PetKit Mini for my daughter for Christmas. She too has an overweight cat (though not for long).

Unboxing and putting everything together is easy, and so far the feeder has been reliable. That said, I think the app is a lot more complex than it needs to be, and while that can be updated and changed over time, it's important to know what you're getting into.When you go through setup of the feeder and app for the first time, I think the experience is a bit all over the place. There are instruction stickers on the feeder itself, there is a booklet of instructions, there are QR codes and links within the booklet to scan to get to videos that you have to watch for further steps, and then there's setup within the app itself... etc. I think it's just a few too many layers of info and could be pared down significantly. Once everything is setup and you're trying to actually use the app, those same issues of unnecessary layers/ complications continue. The app tries to get you to schedule meals based on feeding recommendations for your pet, so you have to setup a profile for each of your pets first. This sounds minor, but it's quite detailed, and includes a whole lot of information that isn't truly necessary just to make a recommendation for feeding quantity. In the end, a truly informed recommendation would really require nutrition information about your pet food itself, so the whole exercise is a bit silly. I was left feeling a bit unsure of how much of this information I *really* needed or wanted to complete. Once you have been asked about various details for your pet, then you need to schedule fixed meals for each, and again I do appreciate that they tried to include a lot of options for customization, but it's just too much. For one, how do they propose that you make sure the right pet eats the right meal, etc? I think it would be much easier to remove those options, or hide them behind an advanced mode, and just let you set a very simple schedule with set times and quantities. K.I.S.S. you know? Given that the app doesn't interface with bluetooth trackers or smart catboxes or anything like that, I'm not sure I see any need for the pet profiles at all! It just adds complexity for no discernible reason.Beyond the actual cumbersome data entry requirements, I found the interface to be not very intuitive. I had difficulty finding the settings that I actually wanted to look for and find out more about, such as the Alexa integration, and kept getting lost in layers of social media integrations and gamification... which, why? I was looking into trying out the Smart Home integration options, but do I need a community and messaging platform for my smart feeder? Maybe this is more of a cultural thing, I believe the company is based in China, but I just don't need this kind of fluff cluttering up the basic functions of the app. I'd really enjoy it more if they could pull back on these added features, or again, maybe just hide them all in one area of the app called 'Social' or similar, but they seemed to be behind every corner. For me, again it just took away from the experience of feeling like I could find the basic information and functions quickly and easily. Thankfully, apps can be can be improved and refined over time, so I feel that most of those concerns are somewhat secondary. If you plan to use it in a way where you can sit down and get through it, then basically 'set it and forget it', I think it will work well for you. But if you would plan to regularly make any tweaks to your meal plans, I think it would be a not-minor annoyance. I'll also mention that this is something my partner and I considered setting up for aging parents, just as a little convenience item to make their lives easier. After working with it, I don't know if I can comfortably go that direction. I definitely don't feel confident that they would have gotten through any of the initial setup themselves, but I also don't think they could make any on-the-fly changes to the configuration even if the initial steps were done for them. My advice to the developers would be: pare down to the basics and make sure they are quick and intuitive. THEN add extras, but remember they are extras and not your primary functions.Ok, so it seems like I'm coming down kind of harsh. All that said, I do think this product will work just fine for use in my own home. The feeder itself is sturdy and has so far been reliable. While I don't have direct experience with a lot of competing products, I had been taking note of some other design issues I'd noted in some of those competitors and waited to try something that seemed to address them. For one, I don't just appreciate the option for plug-in power and battery backup, for me that's an absolute requirement on something like this. The food storage compartment also seems secure, which was a concern I had because I have one cat that will get into ANYTHING edible that is left out. I'm impressed because he hasn't even tried with this, which also tells me the seals are probably decent and he's not being tempted by the smell of kibble. That also leads me to believe that bugs shouldn't be an issue, though time will tell. I also appreciate that the actual food bowl portion is easily removable, as it just snaps into place with a magnet. Being plastic based, it's important to clean something like that regularly and you and I both know that won't happen if it's a pain point. Ideally, I would really like to see this component and the food storage bin being made out of stainless steel, but maybe that's something that could be incorporated in a future revision as well.Let's wrap this up...On the whole, if you are patient and technologically competent enough to get through the configuration of the app itself, it's a good product that I think you'll be happy with."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 12, 2020', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '1.0 out of 5 stars The PetKit app is nearly useless for this feeder! Portion size is randomly variable....', 'author': 'D', 'rating': 1, 'content': ""The PETKIT app is poorly implemented and largely non-functional. I bought this Petkit Automatic Cat Feeder because it promised being able to identify my two cats and calculate their food requirements based on weight and metabolic needs. Using this info I wanted to program daily feedings customized for each cat. This product is another example of decent hardware with poor software implementation. Unfortunately, Petkit and Amazon failed to disclose that the app isn't ready for the hardware. I consider this failure to be a bait and switch scam and I'd return it but I already tossed the package because the delivery person left it in the rain without a plastic wrap for protection.Linking the app and feeder was easy. Connecting to my home router/wifi was easy. It even ran an automatic software upgrade so I know I have the latest, greatest app software. So far so good.Next task is to program my two cats into the Feeding Calculator. Entering the name is easy. Enter the weight? The app reverts to a default weight of 6.8 pounds every time. So it fails to update the cats's weights. FAIL! There isn't any obvious way to edit the cat information either. So another FAIL! Interesting is that I have the PetKit Puramax automatic litter box with my cats' weights entered correctly. The feeder links to the info but changes the weights without any input from me. Another FAIL?Next it asks me to enter their cat food. I feed Purina Indoor Cat Food, a very common dry cat food pellet available in any American grocery store. Instead of a simple-to-use barcode reader that searches online and enters the food analysis for me, I have to enter the analysis manually. Okay, needlessly complicated but okay.The app lets me program the feeding schedule but I'm unable to vary the portion size. I ran a few trials and the portion size isn't consistent.

I almost took off 1 star for the pain in the *** setup and user interface, bit in spite of the those annoyances, I like this feeder so much that I decided to give it the full 5. I\'m so happy that it can dispense portions in increments as small as 1/20th of a cup. I use this feeder to give my cat a small snack in between her normal meals, so that tiny portion size is greatly appreciated. It\'s so nice to be able to adjust the feeding from my phone. We used to go out to eat and hang out with friends until late at night all the time and we always worried about making our cat wait for dinner until we got home, but now (once we can finally go out again) we can just use our phone to give our cat some dinner as soon as we realize we won\'t be getting home until late.Another thing I like about this feeder is that the build quality is really nice. The food tray attaches magnetically so is easy to take off, clean, and re-attach. The food sits inside an inner basket within the feeder, so it keeps all the food crumbs contained. All the parts fit together very precisely so it feels sturdy and looks really nice.

A newer model and differences.', 'author': 'Nicholas Ortega', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""Unboxing this, I was at first unimpressed as I pulled the detached shell which felt flimsy and cheap. The knobs for the fan and LED device were very much plastic, despite looking metallic. But worst of all, the vents on the shell are made of a very cheap plastic that flexes under slight pressure. But once attached to the rest of the backpack, the whole thing felt much sturdier.The quality of the backpack half itself is quite good and very comfortable. I spent a few hours at the park the next day with it on and it was by far the most comfortable cat backpack I've worn. It felt quite sturdy with the weight of my pet inside of it. Most importantly, like other models I've used, it didn't flex upon wearing, giving my pet maximum room to move around. It is quite space and my cat is sort of big. I'm very happy with the window tinting and the ventilation seems to hold up. I'm even more happy only the top 70 percent of the shell is exposed by the plastic glass, giving my pet a sense of security when in need of a hiding place.THE FAN: This is the most important part. I can tell it started out as a gimmick, upon seeing other review pictures, the basic design and airflow of the fan seemed incredibly flawed. I can tell this was the main focus for improvement in this bag. The fan is much slimmer and without a vent for direct contact. I can certainly feel the airflow which is somewhat satisfactory for the size. It is certainly audibly quiet and I can feel the breeze easily from 6 inches away, More so if I stick my head in the far opposite corner. The LED is quite bright. I'm happy with this feature.POWER. No battery is included. You must have your own portable USB portable battery.

After doing research on cat backpacks, I finally bit the bullet and decided to purchase this Petkit bag. Needless to say that I am thoroughly impressed by the design and quality of this bag. My cat absolutely loved it as well and I have taken him on three walks since I unboxed it.-The quality of this bag is really impressive for the price. The front of the bag is a very sturdy plastic material and has enough ventilation for Pluto (my cat) to not feel like he is suffocating. The window is tinted and I’m sure that it will come in handy during the summer when the sun is extremely bright.-The back of the backpack is padded, and the straps as well. It’s super comfortable and I didn’t feel any tension on my back/shoulders. The back of the backpack doesn’t cave in, which is great because it optimizes the space for my cat. The bottom of the bag also holds his weight.-The net area is more of a rubber material so you wont need to worry about your cat scratching out of the bag if they do not like it.-The fan and light is really cool and makes this backpack more high-tech than other ones. The light isn’t blinding and the fan is perfect enough to make sure the bag enough is properly ventilated. It powers through USB.I am very happy with this purchase and the quality definitely justifies the price. I work from home so going on walks is important for me, and this bag is now allowing me to take Pluto with me.

As soon as we bring it out of the closet, she turns into a crotchety old lady, kind of like Jekyll and Hyde, but made entirely out of whiskers and lint. She doesn’t hesitate to let us know how she feels about it either, because she howls incessantly the ENTIRE TIME she’s in there, to the point that she “loses her voice” and her meow and purr are squeaky for day or so afterwards. Since she’s been a robustly healthy girl, the carrier situation wasn’t a huge problem, as she only needed to go to the vet for well visits. Unfortunately, as she entered her sunset years, she has taken up the mantle from the late Wilford Brimley and was recently diagnosed with the diabeetus. Her trips to the vet will be more frequent while we figure out to manage her diabetes with prescription food and insulin shots. Because I am a little extra and I love my cat, I decided that she should travel happy, and in style! She is an indoor cat, but she absolutely loves going outside with a harness and leash, which is how we know it’s the carrier itself that she hates. So as soon as her spaceship arrived, I unpacked it and left it out for a few days with the back open for her to get used to it. Today, I put her harness on (which she happily steps into because she knows it means we are going on an outside adventure!) and put her in the spaceship for a short walk outside. Not only did she *not* hate it (as evidenced by the absence of her singing the song of her people for all to hear) she actually seemed quite cozy and was purring! I gave her a treat as soon as I unzipped it to let her out and she is still my friend so I am calling this backpack a success! I haven’t tried the light or the fan yet because she was only in it very briefly. Also worth noting, is that Kimmy is quite small, weighing in at a whopping 9 pounds 3 ounces as of her last trip to the vet, so I can’t say for sure, but I HIGHLY doubt any of my other 3 cats - who happen to be fat, murder mitt wielding freeloaders - would fit in it. Overall, this backpack is reasonably priced, looks adorable, and Kimmy Katdashian definitely prefers it to her cat carrier, so I think this was a good purchase all around.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States April 26, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '3.0 out of 5 stars You have to buy a separate power source!', 'author': 'Living_Lime_Green', 'rating': 3, 'content': 'The backpack I received has clearly been used though it was sold as a new product. There are four ways I know the bag is not new. 1) The clear protective cover on the ‘window’ was simply Saran Wrap and didn’t even cover the entire window; 2) There are no tags or stickers on the bag that would indicate a new product; 3) One of the external ventilation plates has a mark that is not something that would come from shipping or storing- it’s similar to a rust spot; 4) There was dried organic ‘debris’ on the floor pad (definitely food or post-digestion material).The bag itself is fine. The zipper is awful (it’s plastic and I don’t see it lasting long) and there really should be a second set of zippers so that the bag can be zipped from both sides. I suspect that I’ll want/need to take the bag in to have a better zipper installed. You have to have a separate power source for the light/fan to work and I was not aware of that, so it’s disappointing (my fault- should have read the description better). You cannot charge the fan/light.So far, my assessment is that this bag is not worth the price paid. I paid $60 in a lightening deal and I believe the retail is $100. With no power source, I think $20 needs to be knocked off the price. Since I received a used bag, I also feel like I overpaid.**This is the third cat backpack I’ve ordered and received from Amazon in the past week. The first one was sold as new but was clearly a used bag, and it was not the product that was advertised/ordered. The first bag had no outer protective bag, no window covering film, no tags or stickers, no instructions. The second bag (replacement for the first) was identical to the first -still the wrong model, not what I ordered. The second bag had a protective film on the window, and a generic UPC code sticker on the outer plastic bag, so I’m not 100% certain it was used (sold as new), but it sure didn’t feel/look new. No instructions or tags. I decided to go with another bag and seller with this third backpack. Imagine my surprise when this one appears to be used as well.

First off, it's airline-approved, at least for Alaska Airlines in-cabin, on economy. I was worried this wouldn't fit underneath the seat, because Southwest (another reviewer) had larger under-seat margins. But this backpack fit snugly under the seat in front of me. It will slide about halfway underneath the window-side seat. It will NOT fit fully underneath the middle row seat, so you'll need to take note of that when booking your flights / seat assignment. Airport check-in and customs was fine as well - you can ask for a 'private screening room' if you don't want to take your pet out of the carrier.Now onto the fan and light functions: It's just beautiful.Some buyers don't read the short manual it comes with and then complain that the 'fan and light didn't work.' It explicitly states, in the manual (and I'm pretty sure on the box), that the fan and the light requires an external power bank / battery pack to run. That's it. Simply unzip the side pocket and plug your power bank to the USB cable (built into the backpack). The fan automatically turns on for your pet.My power bank is 4 x 3 inches (10cm x 8cm), but the pocket is big enough to house a power bank of 6 inches (15cm) in height. I thought the features sounded too good to be true online, but they're real! Changing the fan setting from 'Auto' is touch-screen enabled, and turning the light on/ off is just a press and hold. The fan power isn't the strongest, so I wouldn't advise relying on it too much. But it does provide a little extra breeze for kitty. And the light works well too.I think the backpack attracted just as much attention as the kitty. Several people commented on it and never seen such a 'high tech' backpack before.

Unfortunately, he was severely abused and neglected by his previous owner. As soon as I sat on the floor to meet him, he jumped in my lap and claimed me. I guess you could say it was love at first sight.He follows me everywhere and will not let me out of his sight, he cries (screams) and shakes when I leave the room and becomes very nervous. Since he has not fully bonded with the other members of the family yet, our vet recommended that I get a sling so I can carry him around with me while we bond and build trust.Getting him in the sling was a journey, but with lots of patience and praise (and a few little bites of boiled chicken) the minute he went in, he immediately became relaxed and within a couple of minutes he fell asleep.The material feels like a thick but soft and comfortable sweatshirt and it feels sturdy. And the quality (fabric, stitching etc.) is amazing!I love that it is reversible. (Honestly, it feels just as comfortable and the quality looks as good and is very similar to the $100 slings that I have tried on).I am 5\'1 (with my shoes on) and it doesn\'t feel too long (it would be nice if the strap was adjustable because if he sits a certain way, it feels like it may sag) and the wide strap is comfortable. Because of the material, I recommend treating it with a stain and waterproof spray and lining it with a washable potty pad (just in case).The pocket is nice, but it is kind of small, I couldn\'t fit my iPhone 11 Pro in it, but it\'s perfect for some treats or a place to put extra poop baggies.

Any squirming or need-to-wander? the pet will escape. On top of that, there are a few design flaws that make it harder to get the pet in the sling in the first place. And finally, although the strap is technically adjustable, it cannot be lengthened/shortened to a useful amount.I should note that I ended up returning it, even though I really like the quality — my cat struggled too much getting in, which makes it unsuitable for my needs (a quick sling for her to sleep in, when she wants to be held like a rugby ball).ProsThe quality is high: stitching is tight and secure, the material is strong (and yet comfortable to rest against pet and person), and things like straps and pockets are well made.Once my pet was inside, the weight was well distributed and there was enough room for her to turn around without getting tangled.Overall, I felt as if I could carry the pet comfortable for a few hours, if not longer.ConsI was hoping to be able to tighten the strap so that the cat could rest right below my shoulder (her favorite spot), but it's really designed for owners to carry the animal at tummy or waist level. Which is great if you're in the 60% of the population that is around average height, but not useful if you're very tall or very short.Less of an issue is that it takes a lot of effort to adjust the length. Most people are only going to adjust it once, to get it to the ideal length, and then leave it alone.Three other design flaws were a bigger problem for me. First, the drawstring is a great idea for tightening the opening if your animal is completely docile. If not, then you have to open the zipper and the drawstring, at which point the string gets in the way of putting the animal into the sling and zipping it up.The second problem is that the velcro tab to hold the zipper in place doesn't have any place to go while the sling is unzipped. So it keeps trying to close, which makes it harder than necessary, to zip back up. And finally, there's a snap-hook near the drawstring which could be useful if your animal has a collar, but just gets in the way if you don't. It also complicates getting a non-docile pet in and out."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States November 19, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect!', 'author': 'Happy in Hawaii', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I’m so glad I found something like this pet sling- with an opening for my little girls head.

So I ordered the YUDODOGetting a dog into this sling is kind of like fitting a baby into a pouch carrier -- except my babies were savvy enough to figure out what they needed to do to facilitate the process. That\'s not happening with my dog, who is ridiculously sweet but not the brightest, so it generally takes two people to get her settled and zipped up.What I quickly discovered: the sling, even at its tightest configuration, is too long for me (5\'4""). So unless I\'m using my left hand for picking out plums or something, I find myself holding dog plus sling. If I don\'t do that, my shoulders quickly start to ache.The sling is cute and seems to be well-made, and eventually I\'ll figure out a good way to shorten it (nothing so far has worked).

One of our Alaskan Klee Kai is absolutely *obsessed* with bags. It is the weirdest thing! Even reusable grocery bags have to be taken out of her reach or she\'ll spend all day digging pointlessly in her beloved bag. We have a great doggy tote that works really well for outings where I don\'t really need both hands free, but there are times & places that I want to bring my pup while being free to use my hands when a leash isn\'t an option. That is why we purchased this pup pack. Thankfully, it registers as ""bag"" enough to her that she\'s happy to hop inside!I picked this one in particular because of its cute design as well as its carrying capacity. Thankfully, this is as advertised on both counts. The marbled colour is unique & adorable. As for sizing, I followed the chart carefully and selected a ""large"" for my dogs, two of whom are small Alaskan Klee Kai (~12 lbs, one who is denser and the other longer) & another who is a 10 lb papillon (pictured). This has a certain amount of adjustability that makes it work for all 3. Even as small as they are, their weight does bear down on your shoulders, so I am glad the straps are crossable as it adds extra security (though I wish they were more padded). Without that I would worry about the straps slipping off my shoulders. However, even so, I wish this had an adjustable horizontal strap on the front side to help adjust this to my more narrow shoulders, so keep that in mind if you are a narrower person. The fabric was breathable enough that neither of us overheated when worn even in summer.The leg and tail holes were perfectly positioned for my dogs, and it is sturdy enough and padded enough to support them from the bottom without cutting into their legs. Best of all, my pups are content to be lugged around in this carrier. My papillon (pictured) is the most reluctant but also the best behaved, so he has to be strapped in the least often, but it\'s good to know it can work for him in a pinch. My Klee Kai are too rambunctious to sit next to me without being contained, however they are calm enough to hang out happily in their pup pack. I would feel even more secure if this had a clip for their collars but as long as you wear this facing forward you don\'t have to worry much about your pet slipping out.All in all, this works well for my dogs. It has already facilitated a few visits to pet-friendly stores, allowing me to manage two pups on my own and still have my hands free to shop!

He gets tired and wants me to carry him and it hurts my arm and I have to keep switching arms and it’s just a pain so this should make our walks longer and more enjoyable. I also have a female pit and she loves walks so having a big dog and a small dog one can walk longer than the other he takes more steps because he such a little dog. So I’m so excited to try this and I really hope that it helps. Overall the product is very good quality I love that it has zippers on both sides to make it easy to put your pet in it has extra room on the bottom so it won’t squish his private it also has a tail hole which he doesn’t have a really long tail so it always ends up going back in but for dogs who have long tails it will be good for. It also has two straps so you can strap it and then zipper so it makes it very easy. It feels very comfortable on my shoulders on my back which makes it very exciting to try because other bags tend to hurt your shoulder especially the ones that are like a shoulder bag. It has pads for your shoulders. crosses in the back and has large clips on size. Also has padding where your dog sits . I’m very happy with this.I’m not too sure if he likes it yet because I just put him in it to try it and he was kind of confused and kept trying to get out and was kind of shaking a little bit in a little bit nervous because he’s never been in one before. But I think once we’re out walking and he gets tired he’s going to love that he’s being carried in it I definitely have to work on making him comfortable being in it.

We’ve come a long way in the past 6.5 months and my older girl is all about going on walks! Unfortunately, the younger girl is not leash trained yet and is terrified to be outside with her feet on the ground (she was probably previously kept in a cage). Though we’re slowly working on it, I hated leaving her at home and knew I needed another solution in the meantime.In comes this carrier. I was pretty unsure, but it works great! My girl loves sitting in there and is very compliant putting her in and taking her out, because she’s so comfortable. There’s even a whole for her tail! I’m able to get her situated in the carrier and then wrangle my other dog into her harness while wearing the carrier and my dog stays calm and comfortable the whole time. I can easily carry her 5+ miles while walking at the park and going through trails or even just around the neighborhood. I love that both sides fully open up so it’s easy to get her in and make her comfortable. She looks a little weird with the way her legs stick out, but I assure you she’s happy and comfortable. People at the park get a kick out of seeing her and always ask about the carrier for their little pups. My girl is only about 10 pounds, so not sure how it would work with bigger/heavier dogs. My only wish is that there was a way to lock the shoulder pads in place -they very easily slide around, which is a little frustrating and causes some shoulder soreness at the end of a long day.

It was perfect to take her in the car and to go out and get her shots.Love the strap similar to a purse you can easily take with you, but recommended you also hold hand on bottom for extra support when holding and transferring so you can have full support since you can’t rely on straps completely on your growing pup.I also love the screen through the whole top and on both ends of the carrier so puppy can see out of both sides if needed. But since carrier is small you place them inside and they usually stay put in same direction and are unable to turn around since it’s very narrow inside. So how you place your dog inside is the position they will stay in. But since it’s a traveling case it’s more comfortable for your pup and they feel more secure since in small area.We did place a potty pad on the bottom while using and folded it 3 times to fit nicely for the car ride just in case they had an accident.The inside soft material will get soiled if they pee or poop and you will have to spot clean, plus wait for material to dry before using again. But I do recommend this case.I also recommend in investing in harder Plastic Carry Case Small Kennel that opens and Unclips on top side with swinging latch door for longer car rides and vacation traveling since it’s larger and they can move about in the car if puppy gets restless and needs to stretch.

We have no issues with checking her in the bag fit the restrictions, and she had enough room, she is still a kitten but not tiny so if you have a cat that’s got a little pudge this is probably not going to work that well for you. It fit under the seat just fine and it has two different openings one that is large to put the animal in, and the other side is a much smaller opening so you can pet them or give them a snack or let them get some fresh air (not on the plane of course). I found this super helpful to calm her down and sooth her. However there were several issues with the bag, when it arrived it smelled so badly like something from wish it was like toxic, so I left it outside fully open for a few days and it still kinda stunk so I wiped it with wet wash clothes and it was still a bit smelly. It’s also very flimsy so I had to hold the bottom so she wouldn’t get squished up in the bag, and when she was upset and wanted to scratch and kick since the bag was so flimsy it twisted and crumpled with her, often leaving her in uncomfortable positions.My biggest issue and this may not be a problem for you if your cat is more chill, mines a sweetheart and well behaved but just so stubborn, was the nettting. It’s strong and that’s great to keep the animal safely inside, however it’s a bit rough and after a full day of traveling in the carrier, she was upset and the landing was very aggressive and she started to claw trying to escape, she broke her poor claw, tearing part of it off, and she bled but not profusely, I recently landed and it seems to have already begun healing so it seems all is well.My point in all of this being the carrier is fine if you have to travel and fit restrictions however if they are extra stubborn like mine it may be a bit dangerous, and if you don’t have to travel maybe pick another one.

I can put her in it and do chores, walk around, put on makeup, etc., and she’s very content the whole time.

Have tried several times but either they were not the right size or too heavy. This is wonderful. I can actually call her and she could step right in once I get her to understand what it is because she loves going everywhere with me and this will make that easy and fun. It’s light weight but sturdy. Does not have all the bells and whistles that some advertise as having, but it’s a pet carrier not a car. It has a strap with a collar clip to discourage my kid from jumping out. It has easy closures to pull the sling safely closed . The sling has enough room inside that would permit my kid to actually lay down and stretch out as if she were laying on my lap or she can sit and watch the scenery. She has plenty of room and does not make a mummy out of her. I could put my wallet and phone in the sling or in the little pouch on the one end of the sling. I purchased pink lined with soft black and white gingham and everyone will know I’m carrying a princess not a prince. There are cheaper slings I’ve tried (but not by much) and certainly more expensive, but this was very reasonably priced and perfect. Honey weighs barely 9 pounds and will not be getting bigger. If we were so inclined , we could invite a poodle puppy along for the ride and there would be enough room for her guest. I am completely satisfied and would encourage anyone else to purchase this item. I have found that with all carriers, if your sweetheart is 1 pound less than the suggested weight limit suggested for the carrier, get the next bigger size ever though you might be afraid it will be too big. Otherwise you will likely have to get a shoe horn to get your baby in and that will cause your baby to avoid wanting to use the carrier.

My dog seemed comfortable in this one, rather than the fleece one from the store which retains heat. The padded strap is good. Compared to the fleece one, which cuts into your shoulder and cuts off circulation after a short while (though part of that is my dog isn’t exactly a “purse dog” size) I tested this new carrier taking my dog around for an hour. the store bought one would have turned my arm blue in 20 minutes, after an hour my shoulder was still comfortable carrying my dog. But again- time will tell, it’s not high grade padding it’s just foam. So I’m sure over time it will flatten and deteriorate inside the strap. But for now, it seems like a nice product. Some things to watch for- the breathability is great for the dogs, but possibly thin material- foam is great for your shoulder comfort, but depending on your dogs weight could possibly wear down over time.

This pet carrier is sturdy with good seams and strong zippers and a comfortable bedding pad--all for a little over $8.00 plus tax. I want to add, because there was a comment which stated that the carrier collapses when you unzip one of the openings, that opening the front compartment (the side with the velcro for bowl attachment) isn't necessary because there is a zippered opening within the main side opening.

One of the kittens does occasionaly take naps inside. Since I let them play and get used it, it makes it so easy for me to put him inside. I just open the door and call his name and he crawls right in. It zips up easily and I like that there are two ways to access the inside.

This bag is awesome! It is comfortable to wear, easy to get the pup in and out of, and safe for him to be in. We went on several hikes with this and none of us complained about wearing it. The bag itself is light weight and padded. The bag can adjust to your needs of where you want it to sit on you, and there are straps that go around your waist so the bag is more secure on you. Our 10 year old son even carried our 7 pound dog in it for about 3 miles. The straps did not hurt our shoulders at all. It is also very well ventilated so I felt comfortable have our pup in there for longer periods of time. Our puppy liked the lining on the bottom of it and would just curl up and sleep while we were out walking... I am actually going to be sad when he outgrows it haha!

It\'s well designed and well made. The material is nice quality. The construction of the materials is quite good. The pack has two mesh side panels that allow air flow and a view for the animal. There also is a mesh top panel that can be unzipped to allow the animal to stick her/his head out. It also includes a sewn-in strap with a clip that can be attached to the animal\'s collar/harness. I recommend using it, as 2 of the 3 dogs we\'ve used this for have jumped out. I also recommend having your animal in a harness as opposed to a collar in case they do jump out and get hung by the strap.The only drawback is that it is designed for short people (more below).

Dog 1: 15 lb Shi-Tzu - this is about the maximum recommended capacity for the pack. It works well.

She uses the side panels to look at her surroundings as opposed to sticking her head out of the top panel (like the dogs below).2. Dog 2: 8 lb Poodle - perfect for this dog. The dog has plenty of room to move around and change positions. This dog prefers to stand on his back feet and stick his head out of the top panel while hiking. Very happy pup. He loves it.3. Dog 3: 8 lb Jack Russell Terrier -- The pack is the right size for this dog. Situation is similar to that for the poodle. However, this dog does not have the temperament to stay in the pack. The dog crawls through the top opening (which we keep unzipped but can be zipped shut), puts his back paws on the top of the pack and his front paws on top of my head. This is where the strap that can attach to the collar is a good thing. This dog just prefers to keep hiking until he drops. He doesn\'t like the pack.Fit/Comfort for the Human:1. The pack is designed for a short (or very short person).2. Although I am too tall for the pack (5\'10"" tall), I do not find carrying the pack to be uncomfortable. This is because the maximum animal capacity is 15 lbs. Carrying 15 lbs + the weight of the pack (~2 lbs) is not very much weight, so the fit doesn\'t have to be perfect.3. The bottom of the pack hits me at the bottom of my thoracic spine/top of my lumbar spine. If the pack were heavier, that would be uncomfortable. However, the pack is well padded, so it doesn\'t bother me even with a 15 lb dog in it.4. The chest strap helps with pack comfort.5. The hip strap is absolutely worthless (unless you are very short). If the pack were heavier, you would need the hip strap to balance/distribute the pack weight. However, since you\'re only carrying 15 lbs, you can get by without the hip strap. To give you an idea, the ""hip"" strap hits me (5\'10"" tall) at the bottom of my rib cage and above my waist. So it\'s not even close to my hips. The ""hip"" strap hits my husband (6\'4"" tall) across his nipples! So it\'s worthless. But, again, you don\'t really need it.Overall it\'s a good product. I think it\'s the best option available on Amazon. If you\'re tall and do a lot of hiking, you may want to do further research for a Thule or REI model. I may do this eventually, but it\'s fine for now.To the manufacturer: if you\'re interested in making a model for taller people, I\'d be happy to provide feedback on fit.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 28, 2018', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Cat loves it', 'author': 'TL', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""As soon as I opened the package and set up the backpack, my kitten hopped in and made himself comfortable. He is now well on his way to becoming an Adventure Cat six months later! I didn't want to spend a lot on a backpack since I wasn't sure how well he would do with it. I'm so happy to have purchased this one. We've been using it regularly--2+ times a week--since we got it and so far the durability has been very good. I appreciate that it has the chest and waist straps to help stabilize and distribute the weight since I have back and neck problems (and the kitten is now a larger and heavier young adult). There is a reflective stripe on the mesh window, though I wish there were more on various areas of the pack to increase visibility in the dark. Each side has a large mesh pocket; I keep his retractable leash tucked in one for when he gets out to walk. The zippered pocket is large enough to stash a few necessities and extras.I'm starting to train him with the zippered window open so that he has the option of sitting on my shoulder while we walk. It's nice to have the short safety lead in the pack but I wish it were just a little bit longer so he could comfortable move up to rest his bottom on the pack and his front on my shoulder. It's just a little bit too short for him to be able to do that comfortably. One of the best things is the clips that lock the zippers closed. That helps me feel secure in knowing there won't be any accidents if one of the zippers starts working itself loose somehow; the clips only allow a small opening to form if that happens, barely big enough for him to stick a paw through.I leave the pack sitting on the floor near one of his cat towers with the zipper window open.

He is a big 11lb 14year old Maine Coon who is all bone and muscle- he has always been active and run thin.I picked this backpack because it seemed big enough for him to sit up if it was upright and stretch out a little when it was under the seat. He is nervous about new situations and loud noises and people, so I was worried about the flight. The bag came in what seemed like a tiny package, then unfolded and seemed impossibly large to fir under the seat, but it measured within the Alaska Air specified size, so I crossed my fingers, gave the cat a (vet prescribed) sedative, put him in the carrier, and headed to the airport.It wasn\'t hard to get him into the backpack. In spite of being soft sided, all the edges are stiff so it holds its shape well and I could put him in from the side with it standing up and quickly zip it closed. The zippers are all double-ended and have secure clips to keep them from unzipping, so when he scratched at them they slid on the tracks but didn\'t open at all.He was also reasonably comfortable in the bag once he resigned himself to his fate-- much more so than in his usual hard sided go-to the-vet carrier. When it was upright the bottom of the carrier was big enough that he could lie down snugly in the bottom and sleep, and after some protest that was what he did while we were walking through the airport and then waiting to board.When we got onto the plane the carrier slid right in place under the seat without collapsing. Mickey complained about the change of orientation but quickly settled and slept through most of the flight, only fussing when there was turbulence.The thing that surprised me most was that when we got to my new place I put the carrier on the floor and unzipped it for him, and it became his safe ""cave"" where he retreated and slept for the first couple days. This was completely unlike his attitude towards his hard-sided carrier, which gets peed on if I leave it out!My big, crotchety, old cat gives this carrier five stars.

Wide strap and lightweight makes it easy for me to wear the bag, and the pocket seems big enough for a wallet (not sure I\'d personally want to put a phone in it so close to my pup, but one would fit) and poop bags. The first time I put her in it, she wasn\'t so sure, but the bag does hold her close to my body, and I think she quickly enjoyed being snuggled and having a different view of everything. (I gave her lots of treats first ride in the bag!) This morning when she was snuggled up by my side on the sofa, I took the opportunity to put the sling down where she had already been lying, and it was easy when we were both sitting for me to put her in and put the strap over my shoulder and go into the bathroom where I took these pics. As you can see, she was pretty relaxed and this is only the second day.Rosabel, my long-haired chihuahua mutt, is 9 lbs or so, and this fits her well. I am 5\'5"" and like where it comes on my body (see photos). I do tend to support the bag with one arm/hand, but I also did dishes, took the photos, and made myself a sandwich using two hands while she just watched quietly, so hands-free is definitely doable and seems safe for brief periods if you dog is resting quietly. The bag seems sturdy, but it\'s only the second day and I will keep an eye on the stitching.I don\'t use the ""safety strap"" because I will feel her struggle long before she could jump out, and the safety strap and clasp just wouldn\'t hold a 9 lb dog in if she really was struggling. Maybe it would add safety for a tiny 3 lb dog, but I wonder if it is more false security? The bag wouldn\'t be safe if a dog doesn\'t want to be in it, and it would be a long fall. But as I said, my dog adjusted pretty quickly with treats and the view and the cuddliing. If your dog is a cuddler, I should think it will take to the bag pretty quickly if you\'re patient and positive.

Rosie is 6.5, almost 7 pounds and maybe a smaller dog wouldn’t do that, but I thought I’d mention it. I do love the outside pockets for my things and the fact that the carrier totally encloses her, as she tends to want to poke her nose out. I’ll have to find a solution for the uncomfortable straps if I carry her for long periods.So my main purpose of needing a purse for my 6.5 pound chihuahua is to carry her on errands with us in a way that keeps her secure but doesn’t look like an obvious dog carrier. One of the things hardest to find is one that also carries things that I would normally carry in my own purse. Usually I would have to put my wallet and keys in the compartment with Rosie, which is not comfortable for her. Or carry another purse which is not comfortable for me. This one has plenty of pockets for my stuff and plenty of room for her.It’s discreet enough that no one knows that she in there and it’s roomy enough that she’s comfortable. It has mesh on both ends as well as the top to give her lots of fresh air and it doesn’t collapse on her like other purses might.I was a little concerned that others stated it was too small, however, it’s perfect for Rosie who is 6.5 pounds and built like a typical chihuahua.Hope this helps!', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 25, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Nice bag, but had zipper problem…Update:', 'author': 'T.D.', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I had written a review before reaching the company.

A great bang for the buck! Thank you Johomviin! Store!!!(old review) When I opened the box and took the bag out, I assembled it, put my 5 lb chihuahua in it, and when I went to close the top, I noticed that I couldn’t close it because the mesh has a hold in the seam. When close, you can see the hole. I was so disappointed. Plus, yes as someone mentioned, the velcro that holds the handle gets in the way when trying to open the bag…takes a whole process. AND, I wish the front and back zippered mesh had velcro so the fold would hold.But the bag was the right size, big enough for my chi to turn around and a lot of pockets.Too bad it’s so cheaply made, bc I would otherwise love the bag. AND, it’s so light. But I have to return it because the zipper and mesh is so messed up.I’m going to try to get another one.

The bottom is both sturdy and surprisingly soft, making it comfortable for my fur baby during travels.

It's not the best for extended carrying sessions. A longer padded shoulder strap could have been a game-changer for those longer trips.Overall Verdict: 4/5All in all, this pet carrier gets the job done. It's sturdy, comfortable, and just the right size for my Chihuahua, and doesn't look cheap. The shoulder straps are a bit of a letdown for longer trips, but if you're looking for something reliable for shorter journeys, this could be a good fit.

The design would be better if the screen portion on the one end of the bag was from top to bottom instead of as small as it is.The other con - the top zips to the end side where. the screen is and fastens to a velcro tab. My dog poked her nose out and stuck her head out & the zippers moved back enough that she got out. Perhaps it could be modified be adding something that would make the glsp stay down like hook & loop as an example.I regretfully sent it back because it was a bit small for my dog.

I’ll be honest though I’m not a fan of the “do do pet” orange logo on the front but it’s small and it wouldn’t be noticed unless closely inspecting, so random people at the grocery store or at a restaurant or whatever will definitely think it’s a purse at first glance which is what I was going for. There are breathing wholes at the bottom. One side has mesh wholes at the top so your puppy can see out but still have privacy, and the other side has a Velcro opening in case you want to show off your fur baby and let them poke their head out. Otherwise you can close it and they still get plenty of air and can still see out through the mesh on the other side. There are two pockets in the front that are made to look like purse pockets, and on the back of the purse I was surprised/happy to see two additional pockets that are discreet. This was also the only bag I saw with a collapsible bowl and I couldn’t be happier with it. It’s rubber so it easily goes into one of the pockets when you flatten it and then you just pop it open when your baby gets thirsty or hungry.

This one has a wide strap that actually has velcro below so you you don't have to use it as a roller bag strap but as an extra pocket. It still spins around but no where near like the Sherpa. I think it would be helpful it wasn't so wide. Just monitor while using it and you will be fine.2. Love the peep hole on the side. It's just enough that he can poke his head out.

But it's a bit much to ask them to go the distance on their short, little legs, so we were looking for a way to comfortably carry them without cramping our style, either.It was really difficult to choose between all of the carriers out there, so we ordered a couple of different ones and tested them out before embarking on any outdoor adventure. Despite the really stupid name, Yudodo - really? - these were the most comfortable for both my husband and myself, and both of our Poms. The other choice, which shall remain nameless, went back.We next tried these out on a very snowy day of cross-country skiing through a forested area near Mt Hood, Oregon. Snow in this area tends to be heavy and wet and I tend to be clumsy and inept, especially this particular day. I wore my Yudodo pack on my chest, my husband wore his on his back, and we were both quite comfortable throughout the day. While not water or weather proof, the carriers did not sag with accumulated snow. Despite numerous spills on the trail, my Pom stayed securely and safely within her little cocoon. I was even able to carry my regular backpack on my back with the Yudodo on my chest - surprisingly comfortable!My only complaint would be that the outer pockets are too shallow/small for a Hydroflask, but they are fine for carrying poop bags and a very small bag of treats or collapsible, silicon water bowl. I enjoyed feeling like a Momma kangaroo on skis and look forward to some really good hikes this summer, spring, and fall without worrying about having to keep it short for my short-legged babies.Really impressed with the comfort, quality, and speed of shipping.

This product is very nicely made and has lasted strong through some pretty extreme adventures. Each summer I cross country road trip solo with my two dogs and was very limited to what I could and couldn’t do because of them… sometimes I couldn’t even run inside a store to quickly use the bathroom because the car would be too hot to leave the dogs inside for even a few minutes. This backpack changed our lives! It not only allowed me to take them into places they normally wouldn’t be able to walk into, but it also allowed me to start taking them on more adventurous expeditions. They have gone into grocery stores, retail stores, movie theaters, restaurants, museums, and much more, inside of this backpack! They have also gone boating, UTV off roading, jet skiing, snowmobiling, mountain biking, and snowboarding all on my back inside of this backpack!! I included lots of photos to see how convenient it is.It’s important to note that although most of my photos do have two dogs inside of it, it is most comfortable for them (and you) and best when using it with only one dog. But it’s nice to see it can be done with two if need be! I only put both of them inside when I am traveling alone and need to bring them somewhere pets are not allowed (many National park trails and indoor venues do not allow pets so I put them both inside there for those situations). But they are pretty squished when they are both in there, with no room to sit or turn around or anything like that, so I try not to do it too often and for too long. Both dogs are about 13 pounds each. I included a photo of me holding them so you can have a size reference for how big they are (I am 5’6”).The backpack is the PERFECT size for one of the 13 pound dogs inside. It gives them plenty of space to stand/sit/turn around to the other side and even lay down when curled up into a ball. I absolutely love the multiple window zippers! When I am only carrying one dog I alternate how I carry them, depending on the venue.. sometimes I have all three windows unzipped so he can stick his head out either side or the back, sometimes I close the big back one and just keep the two smaller sides open just to poke his head out, and sometimes I zip all of them up so he is fully contained if it’s a place they really really aren’t supposed to be. When I have both of them in there they can really only stand in that one position with one head out the left, one out the right and I wouldn’t be able to fully zip it all it up while both of them are in it.I love this product sooo much that I bought a second one so I could have a friend carry one of my two dogs sometimes. After some hardcore beatings, as the first two are starting to wear and tear, I just came back to buy two more a year later!It’s also important to note that having both of the dogs in it at the same time is about 26 pounds (plus all the waters I carry in the side pockets), and over time that has caused the top of the right shoulder strap to start to rip off on both of the backpacks. (It’s only the right strap because that’s the side I always instinctively put on first so that bears more weight over time). However, I do not blame the product itself for the ripping.. I am knowingly and willingly putting way more weight inside of it then it’s made for so that’s bound to happen. But even then, I have still been using these backpacks for months with the strap barely hanging on by a few threads at this point, with both dogs inside of it, and it’s still holding on strong!! I am extremely impressed! Out of desperation on the road I even poorly stitched up one of the backpack straps with some thread and a needle (I have no idea how to sew but just weaved in and out as many times as I could to hold it together) and that has helped me prolong the life of this thing.So I have used this product with double the amount of intended weight, doing extreme sports with it, for one whole year now, and even though one strap is ripping from the extra weight it is still holding in tack a year later… so when using this product correctly with only one dog I imagine it will last a very very long time without any issues!! And even using it incorrectly with all the extra weight, I have never had any issues with any of the zippers which is huge!!I bought this product originally just for our road trips.. but I now use it almost daily even when not vacationing. One dog is a homebody, the other a momma’s boy, so day to day one of my dogs comes literally EVERYWHERE with me inside of this backpack!! It’s something I wish I had earlier in their lives. Highly recommend!!!', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 22, 2022', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars A great option for carrying on a long hike', 'author': 'Brett', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'We took this backpack on a 5.5 mile hike up a mountain over rough terrain, steep inclines, and obstacles of all sorts.Our dog is a 9.5lb Pom, and it was pretty much perfect for him.The overall structure was rigid enough that it held its shape just fine even with all the top window screens unzipped, too.The shoulder straps aren’t like those you’d see on a nice hiking pack. They’re pretty basic in design a lack much padding, and may chafe a little if carrying a heavy dog a long distance. The chest strap and hip straps are thoughtful. The hip straps also leave some room for improvement and won’t fit perfectly for everyone, but they’re better than nothing and provide some help for a heavier load or long distance just to get some of the weight off the shoulders.The window design and placement is fantastic. The fact that every window can be unzipped was super helpful. We found our little guy liked to stick his head out the side windows exactly like many dogs do with a car.The top center window can be partially unzipped to not open up too low.The bottom center window can be unzipped when the pack is on the ground to make it easier for the dog to use it like a little den.The size is generous. It’s about as large as you’d want to have on your back.The side pockets are also nice. We put a bowl and some food in them.The strap to keep the dog from jumping out is not ideal in its placement. Our dog never tried to jump our once it was in the air, but I wouldn’t trust the strap if he did. On the one hand, if it were a buckle that wouldn’t come undone, that could be dangerous if the dog jumped, and maybe it’s more to give some resistance just suggest to the dog not to jump out, not fully restrain them inside.Also, putting this on and taking it off is sort of a two person operation. The weight of the dog will cause it to tilt/swing if doing it on your own.You probably want to get the straps onto your shoulder while crouching or kneeling. If the dog shifts its weight suddenly while you try to put it on your back, you could accidentally drop the pack with the dog inside. Safety-wise, I think it’s best to put it on and take it off while crouching to minimize the risk. And having someone else lift/hold it makes it much, much easier.The only things I’d change:1. Use more ergonomic and possibly padded straps like on better backpacks or hiking packs. This is carrying a non-trivial amount of weight pretty far from your back, so better straps would probably be appreciated, especially for heavier dogs.2. The internal velcro strap for the dog’s collar to keep the dog inside could be better. It should be attached at a lower and more central point and be just long enough to reach a collar at the window on either side or the back.3. It’s be nice if the bottom was made of a more durable and dirt resistant material and some rubberized edges or feet might keep it more secure when placed on the ground.Overall, I’d recommend this if your dog is an appropriate size/weight, is used to being carried in some capacity, and doesn’t mind small dens or kennels.I’d caution against letting kids use this with a dog.

My cat is 19.6 lbs and loves going out in a stroller. I’ve been wanting to get him out to go hiking with me but I haven’t really found a great way to carry him due to his size.First time in the backpack, as documented in photos, he did great! He fit in very comfortably and had room to sit and lay down. The base is very sturdy and has no problem supporting his weight. He loves that all the windows open and was rubbing himself all over the inside of the backpack. He didn’t like being put in from the side but totally accepted being put in through the top, which I think gave him more of a “getting into a box” feeling.The one think I think will be an issue with this is the bottom base of the bag rubbing on my back for long periods of time. Due to his weight I think it will cause a substantial amount of friction but I think this can probably be mitigated with some layers or tying something around my waist!

The bag was big enough for my 17 lbs pug to move around. The features like the backpack, waist reinforcement straps, multiple access points, locks, and the extended compartment are the reasons I purchased this product, hoping I could squeeze it under the seat based on another person‘s review, even though it exceeded recommended measurements. Luckily, the check in folks allowed us to pass through, but mentioned that the gate personnel could decide differently. We managed our way onto the plane. However after five flights on multiple Southwest planes I must share that we struggled to fit her underneath any seat, and it was challenging enough to just move her into the space between the edge of the seat and the tray tables to reach the floor. It also should be noted that it’s a bit tricky to reposition the dog from being on your back to flipping the bag sideways to put under the seat. And if your dog is on the bigger side, the bag feels heavy and puts pressure on the back. In fact, I ended up wearing the backpack on my front side so my arms could help support it, we could make eye contact, and I could easily talk to/feed her treats to make her more relaxed. Unfortunately the overall experience was stressful for both of us and am not sure that I’ll use this again on a plane even though we spent a few months training her to use this bag.

I put the sling on, put puppy in sling, grab my coffee, sit at my desk, and start work, he will fall asleep in the sling for hours. He will move around and stretch, change positions and I don't have to worry about him falling off my lap. Bonus, I know where he is at all times!

I didn't try to put him in it at first, I just introduced him to it. Next, I put it on the chair and pulled it up around him, but didn't carry him, just let him get the feel for being cocooned within the sling. After that it was just an easy move to being mobile.The only reason I did not give a full 5 stars is the bag had a terrible smell when it originally arrived, but after airring out that went away.

I decided to take him with me to the Los Angels AIDS Walk, 2019, which includes 5 miles of walking, so I bought this bag to put him in after he got tired. I figured it was ideal because it wasn’t hard to lug around when I wasn’t using it.To be honest, he is a little big for it, but it was so helpful that day that I’m not even mad. He doesn’t appear to be uncomfortable, just heavy! I introduced it to him at home in short intervals so that he wouldn’t be scared of it. He really seemed to like it, and on the day of the event, I was able to put him in it while I stood in the opening ceremonies crowd. That was an unexpected bonus, because I could watch the entertainment without worrying that someone would step on him (you do NOT want a drag queen to trip on your dachshund). He got tired on the walk as expected, and went happily into the bag. The downside, of course, is that a 25.5 lb bag is a bit uncomfortable to haul around, especially in the LA heat, but it beats holding him outright for 4 miles. Plus I could put my wallet and water bottle in it with him.Since then we have used it a few times to chill him out when he gets freaked out away from home.

Not great for cat pee.I washed the bottom cover panel on a gentle cycle, by itself, and used minimal detergent and it came out completely shredded.

You could set it on a suitcase or in my case, I held it with the shoulder strap around the back of my neck with the largest mesh side to my stomach (because she was way less anxious that way).The pocket on one side was a life saver and I was able to fit all of her treats, lysol wipes, extra pee pads, little trash bags, and even a zip lock bag of litter. I would recommend bringing a small blanket to cover the top mesh when in a busy part of the airport and to make your pet feel more safe/enclosed.The bottom has a bit of a soft insert, but it's definitely not plush.

This carrier is a bit smaller than the plastic carrier I had, but the mesh on all 4 sides and the top gives him a lot more to look at. I wasn't sure if that would be a good thing or not, but I think, in his case at least, that it helps. I think the smaller size can also be comforting - but I can only guess from his body language and meows what he actually thinks about it. Mostly he just would rather not. But for me, it's far easier to carry, fits better on my car seat, easier to put the seat belt around and makes me feel better when I can see him.

It worked fairly well although it was a bit ugly, would occasionally jam and the portion sizes were very hit and miss. We used it until its power connection internally broke and it would only run off batteries which was difficult to keep up with.So that led me on my search for a replacement. There are a lot more options now than there used to be. My main features I was looking for were wifi control and reliability.I found it difficult to narrow down my choice as I found varying reviews and some claimed that a model was terrible and some said it was amazing. I eventually settled on the Petkit mini feeder from a cost and design perspective. First of all, it looks great. I love the thought that went into the design from the magnetically attached bowl to the jumper that allows the DC adapter to easily disconnect from the wall should you need. I was a little nervous about how much food could be stored but upon seeing the compartment this is a good amount for a cat. I find we need to fill it once every 2 weeks or so.That brings us to the worst part of the product. Lets just be clear here...the app is decent...but there are some language oddities and the setup did not go according to design. I am a techy and I initially tried pairing the feeder with my phone. It got fairly far into the setup but kept failing out during the wifi pairing process. I then tried my wife\'s phone and it did the same. I then happened to notice that the feeder was already showing on the app\'s dashboard and sure enough it had been paired even though the app claimed it had failed. I don\'t know why this occurred but be prepared for some setup issues.Once setup, however, the app is great. The food portion sizes are accurate and on demand feeds occur nearly immediately. The schedule is easy to setup and food is distributed on time. We use prescription ""disc-shaped"" food and other feeders claimed they weren\'t compatible. We have had ZERO issues with this machine getting jammed or having any issue with our food. It is actually very fun to watch the little door open on the machine and then the food dump out.For the cost, this feeder is a steal. It is so much better than our previous feeder it makes me wonder why I didn\'t upgrade earlier. My only suggestions for improvement would be to further improve the app and instructions translations. There are some real English oddities (which you can see in the product\'s amazon page as well. In addition, the setup process obviously needs some improvement too as it failed twice for me and some how magically appeared on my apps dashboard after this fail. Other than that, the feeder is perfect. It feels very high quality and the mechanics seem sound. HIGHLY recommended.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 29, 2019', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars PetKit Mini - Small Pet Feeder - Review', 'author': 'AirplaneCatBlue', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""The PetKit Mini feeder is attractively and elegantly designed. It looks like it belongs in an art museum.The PetKit Mini feeder is the ideal automatic feeder for my needs. What I like best is that it precisely delivers very small meals (as little as 1/20 of a cup or 5 grams) to my overweight cat up to 10 times per day. In my case I had been feeding my cat 20 grams of cat kibbles twice per day... or 40 grams. My cat was waking me up at 4 AM begging for more food. The PetKit Mini stopped the begging behavior! With the PetKit Mini I was able to schedule 8 feedings of 5 grams each... for a total of 40 grams per day... but spread out over the course of the day and night. This way my cat gets precisely fed her reduced ration and eliminates my tendency to give her a little extra when she begs.The PetKit Mini has improved my cat's relationship with me. She no longer relies on me for food. With the PetKit Mini she visits me often and regularly because she wants my company... not because she wants food. And it has improved my relationship with my cat since I am no longer irritated by her pestering behaviors at 4 AM when she gets hungry.The engineers who designed the PetKit Mini payed very close attention to critical details that separate this feeder from the pack. I studied them all before I made my purchase decision. The silicone rubber paddles that meter the kibbles into the rotary dosing cups are designed to flex so the kibbles don’t jam in the mechanism.The engineers used silicone rubber gaskets to seal out moisture at the feeding door and food reservoir lid. Then they provide a replaceable desiccant pack (those little packs that you often find in a box of new shoes) that absorb any moisture that might otherwise accumulate in your dried food. You can imagine that if your kibbles absorbed moisture from the air and swelled up like a sponge that they wouldn’t feed well in the mechanism. It also keeps the food fresher and prevents mold growth I would think.I found the PetKit Mini was easy to set up. It did help that I had an $8 electronic scale so I could better measure in grams how much I had been feeding my cat. I had been using a very small measuring cup. It was a lot easier to weigh the kibbles than to try to measure the volume of food.I measured the amount of food the PetKit Mini delivered with each feeding. I did this 8 times just to see how repeatable the feedings were. With my dry kibbles the average amount of each feeding was 4.97 grams. Pretty good if you were targeting 5 grams! (The standard deviation was 0.31 grams… who remembers what a standard deviation is???)Since I am only feeding my cat 40 grams per day the food reservoir is large enough for storing a 37 day supply. I can just check the food level once per month to be safe… but the PetKit Mini is designed with a monitor that will alert me when the food is low. What a great feature! It will also remind me every 30 days to replace the desiccant pack. I found some after-market desiccant packs on EBay that will fit the PetKit Mini because I couldn’t find any OEM packs online.This is a great automatic WiFI cat feeder! I liked it so much I bought a second PetKit Mini for my daughter for Christmas. She too has an overweight cat (though not for long).

Unboxing and putting everything together is easy, and so far the feeder has been reliable. That said, I think the app is a lot more complex than it needs to be, and while that can be updated and changed over time, it's important to know what you're getting into.When you go through setup of the feeder and app for the first time, I think the experience is a bit all over the place. There are instruction stickers on the feeder itself, there is a booklet of instructions, there are QR codes and links within the booklet to scan to get to videos that you have to watch for further steps, and then there's setup within the app itself... etc. I think it's just a few too many layers of info and could be pared down significantly. Once everything is setup and you're trying to actually use the app, those same issues of unnecessary layers/ complications continue. The app tries to get you to schedule meals based on feeding recommendations for your pet, so you have to setup a profile for each of your pets first. This sounds minor, but it's quite detailed, and includes a whole lot of information that isn't truly necessary just to make a recommendation for feeding quantity. In the end, a truly informed recommendation would really require nutrition information about your pet food itself, so the whole exercise is a bit silly. I was left feeling a bit unsure of how much of this information I *really* needed or wanted to complete. Once you have been asked about various details for your pet, then you need to schedule fixed meals for each, and again I do appreciate that they tried to include a lot of options for customization, but it's just too much. For one, how do they propose that you make sure the right pet eats the right meal, etc? I think it would be much easier to remove those options, or hide them behind an advanced mode, and just let you set a very simple schedule with set times and quantities. K.I.S.S. you know? Given that the app doesn't interface with bluetooth trackers or smart catboxes or anything like that, I'm not sure I see any need for the pet profiles at all! It just adds complexity for no discernible reason.Beyond the actual cumbersome data entry requirements, I found the interface to be not very intuitive. I had difficulty finding the settings that I actually wanted to look for and find out more about, such as the Alexa integration, and kept getting lost in layers of social media integrations and gamification... which, why? I was looking into trying out the Smart Home integration options, but do I need a community and messaging platform for my smart feeder? Maybe this is more of a cultural thing, I believe the company is based in China, but I just don't need this kind of fluff cluttering up the basic functions of the app. I'd really enjoy it more if they could pull back on these added features, or again, maybe just hide them all in one area of the app called 'Social' or similar, but they seemed to be behind every corner. For me, again it just took away from the experience of feeling like I could find the basic information and functions quickly and easily. Thankfully, apps can be can be improved and refined over time, so I feel that most of those concerns are somewhat secondary. If you plan to use it in a way where you can sit down and get through it, then basically 'set it and forget it', I think it will work well for you. But if you would plan to regularly make any tweaks to your meal plans, I think it would be a not-minor annoyance. I'll also mention that this is something my partner and I considered setting up for aging parents, just as a little convenience item to make their lives easier. After working with it, I don't know if I can comfortably go that direction. I definitely don't feel confident that they would have gotten through any of the initial setup themselves, but I also don't think they could make any on-the-fly changes to the configuration even if the initial steps were done for them. My advice to the developers would be: pare down to the basics and make sure they are quick and intuitive. THEN add extras, but remember they are extras and not your primary functions.Ok, so it seems like I'm coming down kind of harsh. All that said, I do think this product will work just fine for use in my own home. The feeder itself is sturdy and has so far been reliable. While I don't have direct experience with a lot of competing products, I had been taking note of some other design issues I'd noted in some of those competitors and waited to try something that seemed to address them. For one, I don't just appreciate the option for plug-in power and battery backup, for me that's an absolute requirement on something like this. The food storage compartment also seems secure, which was a concern I had because I have one cat that will get into ANYTHING edible that is left out. I'm impressed because he hasn't even tried with this, which also tells me the seals are probably decent and he's not being tempted by the smell of kibble. That also leads me to believe that bugs shouldn't be an issue, though time will tell. I also appreciate that the actual food bowl portion is easily removable, as it just snaps into place with a magnet. Being plastic based, it's important to clean something like that regularly and you and I both know that won't happen if it's a pain point. Ideally, I would really like to see this component and the food storage bin being made out of stainless steel, but maybe that's something that could be incorporated in a future revision as well.Let's wrap this up...On the whole, if you are patient and technologically competent enough to get through the configuration of the app itself, it's a good product that I think you'll be happy with."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 12, 2020', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '1.0 out of 5 stars The PetKit app is nearly useless for this feeder!

I bought this Petkit Automatic Cat Feeder because it promised being able to identify my two cats and calculate their food requirements based on weight and metabolic needs. Using this info I wanted to program daily feedings customized for each cat. This product is another example of decent hardware with poor software implementation. Unfortunately, Petkit and Amazon failed to disclose that the app isn't ready for the hardware. I consider this failure to be a bait and switch scam and I'd return it but I already tossed the package because the delivery person left it in the rain without a plastic wrap for protection.Linking the app and feeder was easy. Connecting to my home router/wifi was easy. It even ran an automatic software upgrade so I know I have the latest, greatest app software. So far so good.Next task is to program my two cats into the Feeding Calculator. Entering the name is easy. Enter the weight? The app reverts to a default weight of 6.8 pounds every time. So it fails to update the cats's weights. FAIL! There isn't any obvious way to edit the cat information either. So another FAIL! Interesting is that I have the PetKit Puramax automatic litter box with my cats' weights entered correctly. The feeder links to the info but changes the weights without any input from me. Another FAIL?Next it asks me to enter their cat food. I feed Purina Indoor Cat Food, a very common dry cat food pellet available in any American grocery store. Instead of a simple-to-use barcode reader that searches online and enters the food analysis for me, I have to enter the analysis manually. Okay, needlessly complicated but okay.The app lets me program the feeding schedule but I'm unable to vary the portion size. I ran a few trials and the portion size isn't consistent.

I almost took off 1 star for the pain in the *** setup and user interface, bit in spite of the those annoyances, I like this feeder so much that I decided to give it the full 5. I\'m so happy that it can dispense portions in increments as small as 1/20th of a cup. I use this feeder to give my cat a small snack in between her normal meals, so that tiny portion size is greatly appreciated. It\'s so nice to be able to adjust the feeding from my phone. We used to go out to eat and hang out with friends until late at night all the time and we always worried about making our cat wait for dinner until we got home, but now (once we can finally go out again) we can just use our phone to give our cat some dinner as soon as we realize we won\'t be getting home until late.Another thing I like about this feeder is that the build quality is really nice. The food tray attaches magnetically so is easy to take off, clean, and re-attach. The food sits inside an inner basket within the feeder, so it keeps all the food crumbs contained. All the parts fit together very precisely so it feels sturdy and looks really nice.

The knobs for the fan and LED device were very much plastic, despite looking metallic. But worst of all, the vents on the shell are made of a very cheap plastic that flexes under slight pressure. But once attached to the rest of the backpack, the whole thing felt much sturdier.The quality of the backpack half itself is quite good and very comfortable. I spent a few hours at the park the next day with it on and it was by far the most comfortable cat backpack I've worn. It felt quite sturdy with the weight of my pet inside of it. Most importantly, like other models I've used, it didn't flex upon wearing, giving my pet maximum room to move around. It is quite space and my cat is sort of big. I'm very happy with the window tinting and the ventilation seems to hold up. I'm even more happy only the top 70 percent of the shell is exposed by the plastic glass, giving my pet a sense of security when in need of a hiding place.THE FAN: This is the most important part. I can tell it started out as a gimmick, upon seeing other review pictures, the basic design and airflow of the fan seemed incredibly flawed. I can tell this was the main focus for improvement in this bag. The fan is much slimmer and without a vent for direct contact. I can certainly feel the airflow which is somewhat satisfactory for the size. It is certainly audibly quiet and I can feel the breeze easily from 6 inches away, More so if I stick my head in the far opposite corner. The LED is quite bright. I'm happy with this feature.POWER. No battery is included. You must have your own portable USB portable battery. When using the fan on full speed for 3 straight hours, my 10350 MHZ battery pack didn't budge from having 4 power indicators on out of 4.COLOR: There is only ONE color. The blue and pink is pretty nice with the grey back half, it vertainly doesn't make me feel anymore masculine but it's nice. I really wish they had more color options.Make sure you choose the BREEZY DOME 2 in pink/blue for the newest model and I'm sure greater satisfaction.

As soon as we bring it out of the closet, she turns into a crotchety old lady, kind of like Jekyll and Hyde, but made entirely out of whiskers and lint. She doesn’t hesitate to let us know how she feels about it either, because she howls incessantly the ENTIRE TIME she’s in there, to the point that she “loses her voice” and her meow and purr are squeaky for day or so afterwards. Since she’s been a robustly healthy girl, the carrier situation wasn’t a huge problem, as she only needed to go to the vet for well visits. Unfortunately, as she entered her sunset years, she has taken up the mantle from the late Wilford Brimley and was recently diagnosed with the diabeetus. Her trips to the vet will be more frequent while we figure out to manage her diabetes with prescription food and insulin shots. Because I am a little extra and I love my cat, I decided that she should travel happy, and in style! She is an indoor cat, but she absolutely loves going outside with a harness and leash, which is how we know it’s the carrier itself that she hates. So as soon as her spaceship arrived, I unpacked it and left it out for a few days with the back open for her to get used to it. Today, I put her harness on (which she happily steps into because she knows it means we are going on an outside adventure!) and put her in the spaceship for a short walk outside. Not only did she *not* hate it (as evidenced by the absence of her singing the song of her people for all to hear) she actually seemed quite cozy and was purring! I gave her a treat as soon as I unzipped it to let her out and she is still my friend so I am calling this backpack a success! I haven’t tried the light or the fan yet because she was only in it very briefly. Also worth noting, is that Kimmy is quite small, weighing in at a whopping 9 pounds 3 ounces as of her last trip to the vet, so I can’t say for sure, but I HIGHLY doubt any of my other 3 cats - who happen to be fat, murder mitt wielding freeloaders - would fit in it.

First off, it's airline-approved, at least for Alaska Airlines in-cabin, on economy. I was worried this wouldn't fit underneath the seat, because Southwest (another reviewer) had larger under-seat margins. But this backpack fit snugly under the seat in front of me. It will slide about halfway underneath the window-side seat. It will NOT fit fully underneath the middle row seat, so you'll need to take note of that when booking your flights / seat assignment. Airport check-in and customs was fine as well - you can ask for a 'private screening room' if you don't want to take your pet out of the carrier.Now onto the fan and light functions: It's just beautiful.Some buyers don't read the short manual it comes with and then complain that the 'fan and light didn't work.' It explicitly states, in the manual (and I'm pretty sure on the box), that the fan and the light requires an external power bank / battery pack to run. That's it. Simply unzip the side pocket and plug your power bank to the USB cable (built into the backpack). The fan automatically turns on for your pet.My power bank is 4 x 3 inches (10cm x 8cm), but the pocket is big enough to house a power bank of 6 inches (15cm) in height. I thought the features sounded too good to be true online, but they're real! Changing the fan setting from 'Auto' is touch-screen enabled, and turning the light on/ off is just a press and hold. The fan power isn't the strongest, so I wouldn't advise relying on it too much. But it does provide a little extra breeze for kitty. And the light works well too.I think the backpack attracted just as much attention as the kitty. Several people commented on it and never seen such a 'high tech' backpack before. I love the aesthetic and everything about this backpack. It is pricey, but well worth it - did I mention I've had to carry my cat on 2 hour walks or so?

The one I have had was also collapsible. I had it for at least 12 years. The inside bottom floor was made of particle board and slipped into a vinyl sleeve. My biggest complaint with the carrier was that it was not a pee proof bottom. Particle board would get soaked and come apart. I had to cut cardboard to fit the bottom to replace it many times. Also the inside of the roof of my old carrier had a panel in it that if it slipped out of the casing would collapse on top of my cat randomly. This new carrier is awesome! The ends zip closed to assemble the entire carrier. When the ends are unzipped the whole thing will collapse flat. The back end and left side are solid flat material that is not see-through. The right side and front entrance as well as the roof entrance are heavy black mesh. There is a hand strap with a leather wrap for the handle as well as a shoulder strap. The clasps are of sturdy heavy plastic and metal. The zippers are well made and sturdy. The canvas outside seems waterproof. The very best part of the entire purchase for me is that the floor is made of plastic! A sheet of plastic with a plastic foam layer and the whole thing in a canvas and shirpa sleeve.I set the assembled carrier outside in the sun and the moment my cat stepped outside he walked right into it and lay down. He is about 8 lb and a small mini Maine coon. The medium size was very roomy and he seemed to be very comfortable. I especially like the closed off left side and back. Having the carrier open all the way around would offer great ventilation but no privacy or security. I only wish there was a way to make the top of it closed to protect from wind or rain. Having the top completely open all the time seems like it is begging for a more versatile option however draping a towel or blanket over the top is probably fine.

Plastic, not canvas (for those who rely on pics and rating).', 'author': 'Angry Bird', 'rating': 4, 'content': '6/19/19I’ll say right away that I did not spend enough time reading the reviews or the product details. I looked at the 4.8 average from of the 200+ reviews and thought it couldn’t be less than awesome. I was so surprised to be hit right in the face by an extremely strong chemical smell once I took these carriers out of the packages. My curious cat, even though she typically jumps inside of EVERYTHING to explore it, did not come closer than a couple of inches and squinted a lot as she sniffed the thing. She immediately got out and looked annoyed when I put her in through the top window. The other cat, who is more cautious, never let me put him inside of his, but he is really hard to coax into going into anything (excluding boxes).I did not expect the carriers to be made almost entirely of plastic; from the pictures and the reviews rating, I surmised it was going to be canvas. I washed the carriers and the pads (after removing the hard inside parts) with soap and LOTS of water; they’re drying now. Will see if the smell goes away partially or completely and update. Will also see if I have any issues such as other customers describe (the carrier breaking during transportation, or the cat opening the zipper - that’s just insane; I can’t believe anyone would rate it above three stars after an experience like that).Overall, I feel like I was mislead by the extremely high rating and would exchange these for a different model right away if it weren’t for the fact that I have to move my furry beasts to our new apartment the day after tomorrow, and I don’t want to risk not having carriers for them. Since my cats have grown out of their first soft carriers, I’ve been getting by with a gifted hard shell, and it was enough because I rarely have to carry both cats at the same time. However, they get VERY anxious inside it, and tend to hurt themselves when they’re putting their faces to the air holes because the edges are hard.I was really counting on these to be good. The smell was the first bad surprise, and then the alarming stories in the reviews. I will either bump the rating to four stars if they hold up for the move, or downgrade it to two if any horror story happens with me and mine. So far, this gets a star off for the smell, and a star off to help other customers avoid forgoing research simply due to this item’s high rating. To be fair, however, I’ve noticed that the construction is fairly precise, with all parts fitting together nicely. The zippers, given that you make sure to roll them to the right side over the rib and handle them carefully, seem very sturdy; the carriers keep their shape well if the bottom is inserted snugly (which I also appreciated because our old ones tended to fumble around all the time).Update 7/2/19We’ve moved and the carriers have survived it. There are slight changes in shape with the top, but the carriers are still usable. I can smell them as much as I’d expect to smell this kind of plastic, so the initial strong smell is gone after the wash but there’s definitely residual smell. I had the cats sedated during the move, and we did not have any escape stories, whether due to their good drugs or due to the carriers’ construction. I’m bumping the rating to 4 for now. Will let you know if anything changes with use.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States June 20, 2019', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Seems sturdy and easy to store', 'author': 'Breanne B.', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""This carrier arrived today, I haven't been able to use it yet since I bought it to go pick up my kittens next month, but on inspection it seems like quite a well built carrier!

I was delighted to see that there is two support beams along the top, one on each side, which has me optimistic it won't smoosh the kitty while carrying. The 'leather' handle is a little flimsy and hard to snap the second button. There is a zipper for the small screens on the ends, and another zipper that will open the whole end to be collapsed down. The screens that open also have two zippers so that you can zip from both directions. The bottom layer has a sherpa sleeve, with a foam pad and hard plastic corrugated plate inside; which unzips nicely for you to be able to toss in the washer, I assume. With both ends unzipped the whole carrier collapses easily and can be folded up for easy convenient storage. That's a really nice feature thar I'm pleased with!My only complaint so far is that the screen zippers are a little finicky going in one direction vs the other, but the big zippers for the ends zip smoothly.If I like this carrier a lot after using a few times, I'll definitely purchase a second one for when my two kittens need their own carriers!"", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 11, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Best carrier I ever got', 'author': 'Des', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I had to get a carrier for my kitty rather quickly, as I had to leave for a flight with her in a tight timeframe.

The pockets just fold over and aren't deep, which led to losing his collapsible water bowl before we ever even got through security. The worst part is that it's so flimsy, when using the shoulder strap alone, the sides smash in and basically leave your pet in a mesh net.

You can slip it over a bag! I had a Sherpa bag originally that was twice the price but junk when it came to slipping it over your roller bag. The strap was too thin and it kept spinning around. This one has a wide strap that actually has velcro below so you you don't have to use it as a roller bag strap but as an extra pocket. It still spins around but no where near like the Sherpa. I think it would be helpful it wasn't so wide. Just monitor while using it and you will be fine.2. Love the peep hole on the side. It's just enough that he can poke his head out. He loved it as well.3. Good height and soft enough that it still fits under an airplane seat.4. Just enough pockets to make it useful.5. Nice shoulder strap and carries well.6.

(Some tips, too.)', 'author': 'Kathryn Magendie', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'This BRAND NEW one I just bought - the strap broke in the airport after only carrying it 10 minutes - not happy! My old one lasted for years without doing that. I had to rig it to make it work so I could complete my journey. Though my old one is FIVE stars, I would take off 2 stars for the strap on this new one. I hope the company will make it right.--Update 3: I bought a new one (Original Deluxe) in black and lil Bear loves this one more than the original one. It has more mesh for air (not shown in these pics) but otherwise is very similar to the Delta Black one I had. He actually got in it and took a nap--I was surprised! Still a good buy for the money. Bear is about 15 pounds and is a long-haired chihuahua mix - stocky build - he JUST fits in it. I could go for a large but he is able to turn around, lie down comfortably, and walk in it just fine. I like this one even better than the first one.---------Update 2: Travel. Lil Bear and I did great together with this Sherpa Carrier. I hauled him around the airport easier than I thought, though it killed my shoulders and back to lug around his carrier and my other carry on, but that\'s travel. We went through the security line with no problems at all. And, the carrier fit under the seat perfectly. Lil Bear lay quietly the entire time (but he is a well-behaved awesome calm dog). The medium just fit - I mean JUST fit. I considered whether I should have bought a large but then that would have been too big. So measure your dog and look at the dimensions of the carriers and go from there.-----------Update: I just found the other pocket on the other side! So two pockets!This is a very well-made/constructed pet carrier that I bought for less than I thought I\'d have to pay for such a nice carrier! The \'canvas\' is made of quality material and the seams are firm and intact. There are handles so you can hold the carrier in your hands, or you can use the included strap to put it across your shoulder.There are two openings to the carrier: one on the front, and one on the top. The zippers are heavy-duty and well made. There are also air vents - one on the side, and one on each end that you can unvelcro the covering to provide that air vent.Inside on the ""floor"" of the carrier is a nice padding that will detach for laundering.On the side is a zippered pocket. That would be my only ""negative"" to this - I wish the pocket were a little bigger so I could fit a little more in it, but it would fit some treats and a regular leash. A bigger deeper pocket would be nice, but that\'s not a deal breaker at all.THE SIZE ISSUE: - Besides wanting the pocket to be a little bigger, finding the correct size can be a little confusing. I researched so many reviews before purchasing, and the sizes and poundage were all over the place for a medium carrier! Argh! I knew I didn\'t want a small, but deciding between a large and medium was daunting. I went with the medium and he fits, but it\'s close. It\'s why the 4 stars instead of five, though I\'m still tempted to give it 5 stars, but maybe some videos and pictures from the manufacturer would help. If you are confused about finding the correct size, I can only tell you that my dog is a long-haired chihuahua but mixed with something else - he\'s about 14 pounds, and about 10 inches high or so--measuring him from feet to shoulder/back height, length about 19-20 inches from nose to back (not including tail of course!)--these are approximate as it\'s more difficult to measure a dog than I thought (laugh). He fits inside the carrier with enough room to turn around but it\'s close - he can stand but it\'s very close - he\'ll be lying down 99% of the time and he should feel secure and comfortable. I have no idea about under the seat issues, yet, because this will be my first time to fly with a pet. The large may have been too large where he is kind of shuffled around in there - I felt the medium gave him some security from being ""knocked about."" I don\'t know if this helps, but I do suggest ordering early enough that you can not only train your dog to be comfortable with the idea, but also to gauge the size.My dog is a chihuahua-something-I-don\'t-know mix, and is about 14 pounds. He\'s about 10 inches high. He fits in it just fine. I didn\'t want him to have so much room that he was ""knocked about"" as I carry him, but he has enough room to stand--but just enough to stand, and he can turn around in it. The small would have been way too small, and the large would be too large. But he fits closely and I\'d not want it any smaller than this.Surprisingly, the weight when you carry him even if you use the shorter straps on your shoulder isn\'t bad at all.Some Tips for getting your dog used to the carrier:They include a little tag with some tips. I did my own thing, too. If your dog is not used to a carrier, some things you can do are:I did these things one or two times a day only:Make sure the carrier is associated with something good - way long before your trip is to come, you should start preparing your dog so he isn\'t scared of something new.I started early on by putting a treat inside the carrier and put the carrier by the side of his bed. I just let him go in and get it without me closing him up. I did this for several weeks, the only difference is that after a couple weeks of doing this, I gently nudged him in and closed the front ""gate"" but didn\'t zip it-I petted and praised him. Doing this a few times, whenever I\'d pick up the carrier to bring it over to his bed even before I opened the treat can to put in the treat, he\'d be excited, knowing he was going to get a treat.Then next stage I put the treat in there, but I closed him up. Did this a couple times, reaching my hand through the top part and petting and praising him.The next stage, I closed him up with the treat and carried him around my house, talking to him in a happy voice. This is the stage where I am now. By time my flight comes, he\'ll be very comfortable inside there. I\'m also going to take him in the car and drive around with him in it.He\'s a calm well-behaved dog, so I don\'t expect any problems at all. If I have problems once I do take my trip, I\'ll be back to report that.I do highly recommend.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States November 10, 2016', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great, easy to roll, light enough to carry', 'author': 'yuie', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Bought for our dog.

It would be nice to have a stopper so it won’t roll on its own such as on a moving tram.

I\'ve never done that before so I did not know where to start. In doing research I found the Sherpa Delta Pet Carriers and looked into them. This product which we bought fit the bill both in terms of cost, sizing and quality. And it was Delta approved!As I noted above we flew on Delta and had four flights. The bag easily went under the front seat in a 737 for all four flights. It also was very easy to carry slung over one of our shoulders as we made our way through the airport. It has adequate ventilation and fit our 9 pound or so dog fine. She seemed to be fine in it but I will speak to that a little later.If you are going to fly with your pet, this is what I recommend:1. Call your airline and confirm their restrictions/limitations on pets and carrier sizes. Do NOT skip this step!!! Make sure to do this for the specific flights you are looking at (or already booked) because the size of the aircraft does matter as to what carrier will fit or not. When you cal the airline make sure you have the dimensions of the carrier and provide that to the agent.2. Ideally before you book your flight make sure that it has ""room"" to accept pets in the cabin. I found, at least with Delta, is that they only allow a certain number of pets on-board any given flight (I believe it is four but don\'t quote me - confirm with the airline). If there is no room then you are out of luck. Better to find this out before you book than after.3. You may have confirmed before you booked, but you must make a pet reservation after you book your flights. I\'ll tell you I was so scared when I called to do this as I did not know I even had to make a pet reservation. Thankfully, and this SAVED me, the Sherpa carrier included a sheet with instructions on flying with your pet and recommended making a pet reservation with the airline. If this tip had not been included, I think I would have been sunk as I would not have done this.4. Condition your pet (dog or cat) to the carrier BEFORE you fly! I think you should start this weeks before to see how they adjust and acclimate to the carrier. I imagine some pets will be fine, but others, like our dog, will want to get out as soon as possible! She just does not like to be ""contained."" What we found though is that we could appease here by passing treats through the zipper on the top of the carrier. And once the flight got going it was a blessing but she settled down. Maybe the movement or noise of the engines; I\'m not sure but she did fine.5. Be ready to pay a fee to fly with your beloved pet. It is financially painful but something that they all require.6. We made sure our dog\'s vaccines were up to date and got a certificate from the vet for her to fly. We never had to show this to the airline agent and it appeared to not be required so you may not have to do this if they are in the cabin (you do if they are in cargo). Depends on how paranoid you are but this is an option if you want to have that ""just in case.""7. We did not have to remove our pet at security as some said they had to. I guess it depends on the agent or air carrier.One, one more ""tip"" is if you have a pet that is hyper or does not travel well is to speak to your vet about Dramamine for dogs (I\'m sure for cats also). We did not have to use it for this dog but have for another dog we have to for car sickness. It takes the edge off the dog and helps it to settle down. I\'m not for giving dogs medicine if they don\'t need it but I think to help the dog with anxiety it is well worth it and safe. And it will make your flight a lot more enjoyable as you don\'t want to be ""that"" person who everyone on the plane is whispering about :)Happy travels!', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States November 24, 2016', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Our cat was not happy about being in a cat duffel bag but it traveled well trans-Pacific', 'author': 'OhanaMamaMia!', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Our cat is more Onry than most, so halfway between Hawaii and the mainland he managed to break the board that offers the bottom support, mostly because he was scared and actively trying to destroy the bag from the inside out. He’s never flown on a plane before so he was pretty scared, most cats would not be able to break the board but he is a super strong cat. That was the only drawback to this cat carry case, which fit perfectly under the seat on Alaska airlines and had no trouble getting through security. A word of advice traveling TSA from Hawaii to the mainland they made me take the cat out of the bag at TSA and hold him to go through security, luckily he had his harness on and I had a leash in the cat carrier pocket so I was able to secure him in case he jumped out of my arms at security. There were a lot of jokes from bystanders about “letting the cat out of the bag“. 😂 In spite of his best efforts to destroy the bag from the inside out he was unsuccessful, this is a sturdy cat carry case that will stand up to the sharpest claws!We had a 5 1/2 hour flight from Hawaii to Seattle and another four hours from Seattle to New Mexico and by the second half of the trip he had settled down and seemed to enjoy his cat carrier. When we traveled by car after reaching our destination he went into the carrier without protest and rode quietly and calmly in the carrier. A word of advice on putting your cat in the carrier, if you hold him and fold his legs underneath him, and hold both his front legs with your hand as he put him in and zip it quickly, he doesn’t have time to scratch the heck out of you struggling to avoid going in the bag.When we had a two hour layover in Seattle I took him into a family bathroom in closed room, and let him out for a few moments to use his portable litter box and drink some water. He didn’t protest when I put him back in the carrier.He was not drugged with a kitty tranquilizer on the flight, and for the most part it was a smooth flight thanks to his cat carrier, I was very grateful that the carrier had just a quick glance from the ticket agent and was waived through as being approved.Our cat is a little larger than most, and he fit in this carrier just fine and was quite cozy. I didn’t have any trouble getting it under the seat in front of me, and the shoulder strap made it easy slung crosswise over my shoulder to carry him through the airports on layover.I was surprised that the carrier held up to his attempts to get out of the bag during landing, because of all the scary noises and fast dissent he was pretty scared and actively trying to destroy the bag from the inside out. The mesh held up just fine and so did all of the seams, and he was unsuccessful on trying to get the zippers open.I’ve attached a photo of him from our layover in Seattle when I let him out of the bag for a few moments in the family bathroom to stretch his legs. He’s just like, “What the heck mom??!”So if you have a very long plane trip coming up with your cat, I recommend this bag. Other than him breaking the board in the bottom, it held up to his claws and teeth for the entire trip and seemed to provide a safe cozy space where he eventually settled down and was calm.(I want to add that him breaking the board is not a huge drawback because this is the second cat carrier he has had and he also broke the board in the first one which was a different brand, he’s brutal!)', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 17, 2021', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Guaranteed On Board!', 'author': 'Amanda Mincolla', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Setting off on an adventure with my furry companion has never been easier or more stress-free, thanks to the Sherpa American Airlines Travel Pet Carrier.

Fits most USA airline requirements. I checked few other international ones and seems to go with those ones too if they allow pets on cabin.2. Has 4 mesh sides opening. Three o them allowing you to roll up or down a plastic screen to provide your pet with privacy. This may be beneficial to scaredy pets.3. It has locking zippers so pets don\'t open from the inside.4. The mesh is claw/tear resistant. BUT the warranty won\'t cover if your pet tears it. (Soft carriers makers could use the same pet-proof patio mesh screen that is more resistant)5. The carrier comes with a leak-proof travel tray, and the liner that also comes inside the tray has a water-proof backing. I will still put a pad somewhere6. The attached wheels are a plus but can also be a con. More to this below.CONS 1. Due to the attached wheels the inside dimensions of the carrier are JUST 8 inches in Height. My cat weighs 10.8lb but being a male he is taller than female cats. Therefore 8 inches is NOT tall enough for pets to feel comfortable on longer trips when they need to stretch. This brings the next main issue of the carrier.2. The inside does NOT have an collar tether clip to secure your pet to its collar or harness when the top area is partially or totally open. A master escapist cat can jump swiftly . Especially in moments like when TSA agents ask you to open the carrier to explore contents. The saying ""let the cat out of the bag"" will come true and this is when "" Sh*t hits the fan"". See video on YT called ""Loose cat holds up Delta flight from New York to Texas.3. The side openings do not come down completely. Just 2/3rds of the way when being pushed with your hand or 1/3 of the way with no downward external force . To me this means the best way to get your pet inside the carrier is via the top entry. I tried doing this with my Boots and he extended his legs farther than Simone Biles doing a split.4. The pull on for the wheels seems uncomfortable . I am only 5\'2 and feels bit short. I cant imagine someone taller trying to pull and not bending backwards and sideways to reach it.5. The only are way to store personal or pet belongings on this carrier are via the outside hanging harness clips. No zippered area. Perhaps this is why it has 4 mesh screens openings versus other carriers who just have 3.OTHER DETAILS1. Not all 4 wheels turn 360 degrees only the 2 front ones. This may give the carrier more stability as it is explained on their website. Or it may make it hard to make turns in some areas.2. Note the way you would push a pet under an airplane chair is through the BACK of the carrier since that area is not as sturdy as the front (where the pull handle is). The back area is one with mesh screen pull down.3. They makers say the seat belt can work as a luggage strap . Maybe yes maybe no . But it will be inconvenient to do this in airport . You would have to unlatch the pull handle to then latch it to luggage and roll. Then to use the wheels you would again remove the pull from luggage to roll it.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 6, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Traveled with this carrier with my cat safely and comfortably from florida to germany!', 'author': 'Cecilia', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'This is going to be the review of a lifetime, because i really tested this carrier to its limit! And I have some advice for people traveling extremely long ways on planes specifically with theirs pets if they’re in need of help! I recently moved from florida to germany and i of course needed to take my cat with me, so I got this carrier! Off the bat, i was shocked when my cat jumped into this carrier and took a nap VOLUNTARILY in it when it arrived! There are some photos of her in it, she’s about 13 pounds and average sized, couldn’t find any good photos of the carrier itself, looks exactly like the pictures though so hopefully the ones I provided will give you some more insight. The video is just showing what she looks like inside it. Our total trip was about 24 hours, from driving to Miami was 4 hours, the flight to Zurich swizterland was 9 hours, than the layover which was 4ish hours and our last flight was 1 hour and the drive home being another one. What I brought for my cat: health certificate needed to have for an animal in the EU, rabies vaccination, mircochip paperwork and paperwork my airline needed. Items I brought: pet safe wet wipes + wet wipes in general (for in case of accident), a pee pad, a travel litter box, lightweight litter with scooper, litter box liners, her medicine, portable water bowls, also don’t forget the collar, the harness and the lead! I actually only needed up using her medicine and water bowls other than her harness and everything but it felt good to be so prepared! ****Also huge huge tip from me: ask for a private room whenever you take your cat through security so they can come out of the carrier in a closed enviroment and the airline people can check the case that way, did not know this when i did the security and it was a bit embarrassing when my cat did not wanna out because of the loud noises and i held up the entire line🙈🙈**** I gave her no food the entire trip to avoid her having to go to the bathroom and cats can hold their pee in for 24-48 hours which is okay in emergency cases like this, only fed her when we got home,Just the medicine the doctor provided the morning of and of course as much water as possible! She did soo great, i also HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend the felineway calming spray and respray if you can every 4-5 hours. Expensive but worth every penny!!! She is a totally different kitty! onto the carrier! It worked great, it is totally sturdy and I love that there’s a hand held strap plus a on the shoulder strap. I never felt like it was going to break or that isn’t wasn’t made of solid material. It is very very small, once your cat is in there it can’t move or turn in the opposite direction it can only lay, however this size carrier was the requirement for my cat in the airline and it made through the inspection perfectly. The only thing is that theres not many windows, there are on the sides and one in the front but in the future from the same company I might get one with more windows because I was worried, and when I stuck my hand in there multipe times throughout the flights and journey she felt a bit hot but I’ve read other cats on flights getting hot being in the cabin so normal probably, that is truly my only complaint and I would open her window up on both sides a bit and try to fan with her an actual fan whenever i felt she was a bit hot and give her water, if she didn’t want it I would put some of her paws and neck and mouth anyways, however I felt good about her being in so i think it is totally fine and my kitty did just fine ! I took her out as much as possible, like in the car or during the layovers I took her to the family bathroom and let her run around. She was soo chill, no meows or anything which normally she is very energetic and vocal thank you felineway calming spray! So if you have any doubts, definitley buy this thing!

There is no solid bottom so it really is like your dog is sitting in a bag, but the bag is more the shape for his body. So it seems to work.The fabric at first seemed thin but I actually think it is pretty sturdy and it is comfortable to wear and the strap is well padded. If you live in a warm climate, it can be warm to both wear this and be in it for long periods. (I noticed both me and my dog seemed to heat up!)My dog was about 13 or 14 lb when he used this. He is a thinner body type so he was probably taller than most puppies that weight. Because of his height, I'd always keep one hand on him whenever possible when using this sling to make sure he stayed in place.My only criticisms would be that the seller photos make the sling look much deeper than it actually is. When folded in half flat into a front and back, the actual pouch is about 11 in deep. That is not allowing for the width of your dog. So once you leave about 4 or 5 inches for the width of a dog, the sides only go up six or seven inches. There is a generous mesh top that has a drawstring that goes all around the opening. It is about four to five inches deep. So, for my dog when I put him in this, I would draw up the mesh portion and tighten it around his shoulders. The fabric part of the bag would stop around his chest or tummy and then the rest would be just the mesh. (My dog is a rat terrier mix, but he has a thinner body and longer legs.). I will take a picture to try to show the depth. There is a small strap that comes from inside with a hook to help encourage keeping your dog in the sling.My other criticism is, it does have pockets, but none large enough for a phone. Thats not a huge deal, but it would just be convenient.Overall-- I liked this sling and now that my dog has a healed leg, I'm passing it on to my daughter for her cat.

When you walk with your dog in it, you have to compensate the weight applied on one shoulder (the one that holds the carrier) and your spine ends up not aligned, which puts pressure on your spinal cord and disks. I suppose the smaller the dog (10 lbs or less) the better. 2) the carrier is too bulky, the sling especially is too wide and too long.

There are lots of straps, so you'll want a friend to help buckle and align everything. Some of the straps could be bigger/wider/more padded to add comfort. It was OK to get him in while we were at base camp. Then we let pup down to walk midway through, only to put him back in after a few hundred yards and we completely missed the tail hole which left him side-saddle in the harness for the last leg of the trip. I'm sure this is just some things to try to figure out as we go.. For what it's worth, pup was content while he was in the pack, it just looked weird with legs forward :)"", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 7, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Game Changer ✨', 'author': 'Phoebe🤍', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'The media could not be loaded.

I could not get my black kitty out of it after setting it up, he was very comfortable for hours, so I take this as a good sign that when I pull it out, he will not freak out, he will calmly crawl in, I will zip it up and then we can go. This has everything I have in my first cat carrier that I love. I love that there are several ways to open the carrier, whether its better to do it from the top, the right side, left side, you have options. I also love that there are also zipper pockets so if you have treats, meds, leash that you need to take with you, you have a pocket to put it in. Last but not least I absolutely love the strap that comes with the case, it makes carrying so much easier if I can fling the weigh onto my shoulder rather than my forearms.

My cat is within the weight range - 14 lbs. - but he's long. Just looking at him standing alongside this carrier he may be too big for this.However, we fly Southwest and the ad says it will fit under the seat which is why I ordered it. I like that this can be laid on its side to slide under the seat. The soft floor pad is on the bottom and one side, which will give a little cushion should the side become the floor.Tonight Hunter explored it from the outside and went in to get a few snacks. He likes his hard-sided carrier so I'm sure he'll get used to this one for travel.There are lots of zippers, pockets, and openings so you ought to be able to get a reassuring hand on your pet no matter how the carrier is positioned. It is very light weight (at least until my big boy is inside). It also has a short leash sown to the carrier that we could clip to his halter. Might be a good idea, but also might be a danger. We'll see what makes sense as we get closer to traveling.UPDATEHe hopped in through the top this morning after the snacks I put inside. It's snug, but he was able to turn around. In the meatloaf position, which he sleeps in for hours, he ought to be ok for a short plane ride.Packing it up again I found some other features that make this carrier very nice:- The two end pieces have strong wire frames, giving shape and structure to the whole thing when they're zipped up.- The fuzzy fabric, which securely attaches with velcro to the bottom and side, also gives structure to the carrier. The fabric has a hard bottom inside so when you're carrying your pet, they have a firm foundation under them. The portion of the fabric that goes up the side doesn't have that hard piece.- When the ends were unzipped and the fabric removed, the carrier easily folded up flat like it came. Adding the fabric and shoulder strap within the folds and wrapping the handles around it, it slid back into the plastic bag it came in. Very happy with this - won't take up much space in storage or a suitcase if necessary.The photos document Hunter exploring the carrier. He will do anything for snacks so I never force him. He would not go into the carrier from the end - it's really close quarters. He just grabbed the snacks but resisted a gentle push from behind.This morning he hopped in from the top to get snacks and you can see he turned around. He's too tall to fully stand if it's zipped, but meatloaf is good. The photos of him popping out the top and looking back in were after he'd already been inside, so he wasn't averse to calling it his.The last series of Hunter measuring the bag for himself should also give you a size comparison. Look at the one in the plastic bag and the size of the cat that actually fit in there. There won't be any stretching out, but hopefully the time in the carrier will be minimal.

It is well-made although the strap could use a little more padding where it sits on the shoulder. Second (and most important), my cat explored the carrier voluntarily after getting used to its presence. When we had an 11-hour road trip, she fit cozily in the carrier (I put in her through the roof access).

This carrier met my chunky monkey's needs during our multiple flights from Tampa to Maui.Here's the tea: I chose this carrier because expandable sides are rectangular vs. theaccordion styles. My biggest concern was that there wasn't enough ventilation due to having solid sides for the expandable flaps and butterfly-like bedding inside the carrier. The bedding also doesnt give much room inside the carrier (when more room is needed). It also insulated the carrier making it too hot for my dog.My solution: swap the bedding with our old sherpa bedding that my dog really likes and forego the butterfly-like bedding. OR just tuck in the butterfly flat under itself to make one bedding. This way, the side flaps is able to partially open for more ventilation.2 things that needs improvement:#1. Add a velcro flap to hug and secure the carrier on to the wheeled handle. It wasn't fun towing the carrier behind me nor having to balance the handle for the carrier to be on my side, like you would with a regular luggage.2. The leash clasp inside the carrier is flimsy.

He is 3 months old and about 10 lbs. I can easily carry him for 30-40 minutes with no problem. He loves to sit in the sling and watch the world go by as momma does all the leg work :) when he gets tired he can curl up and take a nap.One of the best uses I have found for this sling is how it has helped us bond and kept me sane while working from home and trying to manage a new puppy. I put the sling on, put puppy in sling, grab my coffee, sit at my desk, and start work, he will fall asleep in the sling for hours. He will move around and stretch, change positions and I don't have to worry about him falling off my lap. Bonus, I know where he is at all times! Really it has been a lifesaver with the whole Covid-19 and trying to work.I introduced him to the sling by placing it on the chair next to me and putting him on top of it. I didn't try to put him in it at first, I just introduced him to it. Next, I put it on the chair and pulled it up around him, but didn't carry him, just let him get the feel for being cocooned within the sling. After that it was just an easy move to being mobile.The only reason I did not give a full 5 stars is the bag had a terrible smell when it originally arrived, but after airring out that went away.

He generally walks everywhere, but gets tired after a mile or so. I decided to take him with me to the Los Angels AIDS Walk, 2019, which includes 5 miles of walking, so I bought this bag to put him in after he got tired. I figured it was ideal because it wasn’t hard to lug around when I wasn’t using it.To be honest, he is a little big for it, but it was so helpful that day that I’m not even mad. He doesn’t appear to be uncomfortable, just heavy! I introduced it to him at home in short intervals so that he wouldn’t be scared of it. He really seemed to like it, and on the day of the event, I was able to put him in it while I stood in the opening ceremonies crowd. That was an unexpected bonus, because I could watch the entertainment without worrying that someone would step on him (you do NOT want a drag queen to trip on your dachshund). He got tired on the walk as expected, and went happily into the bag. The downside, of course, is that a 25.5 lb bag is a bit uncomfortable to haul around, especially in the LA heat, but it beats holding him outright for 4 miles. Plus I could put my wallet and water bottle in it with him.Since then we have used it a few times to chill him out when he gets freaked out away from home. Like at Christmas when he could not stop fighting with our cousin’s pit bull.... we just shoved him in the bag and he calmed down.

I love that it's reversible and it includes two button closures on top if you want to lock the pups head in place so they aren't trying to escape or turn around too much. Also includes a cell phone pocket on the strap, I use a wallet case for my phone so the pocket is a little small for my phone, but I think it would fit most standard Apple/Samsung-style smartphones without issue. There is a clip loop as well to connect to your dogs collar or harness so there are no escape artists.Our dog is 8 pounds and the strap on this did not cut into my shoulder and feels like it would be really comfy for a long time without issue. The strap length is adjustable so for those worried about the buckle mentioned in the reviews, for me this sits mid-back, because of how I adjusted it (I am also plus size and this fits me without issue). I honestly don't notice it at all, so if you are worried about this cutting into your shoulder, simply adjust it to a different length, problem solved. Really happy with this especially for the unbeatable price. No complaints when I was really expecting a poorer quality than we got.

I do have to help him get in and basically put him in it since there's not as much room for him to step in and turn around into position like he's used to. I like that it keeps him closer to my body so it's easier to get up and walk around with him in it and it doesn't disturb him as much if he's in the sling pouch that hangs loose.It washed well and I was glad it came with a storage bag since it' is so long"", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 27, 2023', 'is_verified': False}]"

Because she\'s already so big, I wanted something that would mostly ease the burden of carrying her until then, maybe give me a free arm for short periods. She\'s a bit big for it, even though I don\'t believe she\'s 20lbs yet - her front arms can get out pretty easily, and if she really decided to get out, if I didn\'t stop her, she\'d definitely be able to.Considering how big she is, I\'m quite impressed with how sturdy this is. It\'s really just a long piece of cloth that you wear a specific way, but it\'s pretty cool. The way you tie it up (following the video) I could even untie the back completely and it held her (I wouldn\'t do that - but if it came untied for some reason, I don\'t think you\'d lose your dog before you noticed). I definitely think it would be more effective with smaller dogs, but it definitely can hold her.I got another dog \'backpack\' that is quite large, both for her to grow into, this was actually the back up in case that one was too large still (which it is), and while the other supports her better and she seems happier with, my shoulders quite prefer this one.

It has a wonderful design with vented sides and a storage pocket. A great feature is the extenable handle and wheels. However, the assembly of the wheels is problematic. The stem of the wheel has a notch near the top. A piece of metal in the insertion hole is supposed to slide back as the stem is pushed in and then click into the notched area. Unfortunately the metal piece basically refuses to yeild to the stem and it was increadibly difficult to get the stem inserted and seated as designed. Two of the wheels don't swivel when inserted and the two nearest the extendable handle do swivel. After a rather extended amount of time and effort (I used a flat head screwdriver to push the metal piece back while pushing the wheel stem in) I was so glad to have all four inserted. Then it was pointed out to me that one of the non swivel wheels pointed toward the back of the carrier while the other pointed the opposite direction. This meant that the non swivel wheel pointed out the front of the carrier needed to be removed and re-inserted 180 degrees the other way. I had to wait until the following day for this challenge. When I felt brave enough to try, it didn't matter what I did, that silly wheel whould not come out. So I had to remove the face plate overlying the insertion area and disengage the metal strike piece. What a major pain was all of this. Now that all of that is behind me I like the carrier and see it as a helpful item for our feline fur babies.

It took me two uses to figure out how to get the straps adjusted and learned to strap in my dog. Which turns out to be very important! The first time I used it, my dog leaned forward, tried to climb out the head hole and almost fell out, while on my back!! There is a hook to attach to your dog\'s collar, inside the backpack, make sure you use it! Next it took time to figure out the straps. The padded straps are very nice. The only downside to the backpack is that you can feel the heat transferring from your dog to you. I got really warm carrying my dog wearing a sweatshirt. If your dog is warm, you will be warm!!! Sweaty almost!! I bought the backpack for hiking with my dog and for taking him inside shopping stores. There is a large sign out front of one of those stores I ""tested"" now that says ""absolutely no dogs allowed."" He never even caused any problems inside any of the stores. And he is a registered service dog, so that rule cannot apply anyway. Please think about your dog if he or she is protective in their kennel....their head sticks out the top of the backpack, while the rest of their body is inside. If your dog doesn\'t like being pet in their kennel, they might not like to be pet while inside the backpack. There is not much room to lay down in while inside the backpack, but a toy size dog might be able to. So, give your small to medium size dog a walk or rest break after sitting inside the backpack for awhile. I love the colors of the one I bought! The fabric is well made. The backpack is easy to use. I recommend using treats and slowly introduce your dog to getting inside the backpack. Sticking my dog directly inside was a struggle. So I tried laying the backpack down, making a trail of treats and letting my dog go inside of it and sniff around. Then i started scooping him into the backpack. After a few tries, with lots of treats with this, he was ready to sit inside. I also recommend setting the backpack on a table or a tailgate to put it on your back. Sounds silly, but makes it easy to just put your arms into the straps and go! My dog is about 7 pounds, but I\'m weak at lifting up and had some trouble with it. If you have strong arms, might not be an issue. I found I could carry my dog for about 2 hours, then we took a break.

I'm Shocked How Good It Is!"", 'author': 'Ryan A. Leemhuis', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'A little background first. We had previously used the Crown Majestic feeder for our cat. It worked fairly well although it was a bit ugly, would occasionally jam and the portion sizes were very hit and miss. We used it until its power connection internally broke and it would only run off batteries which was difficult to keep up with.So that led me on my search for a replacement. There are a lot more options now than there used to be. My main features I was looking for were wifi control and reliability.I found it difficult to narrow down my choice as I found varying reviews and some claimed that a model was terrible and some said it was amazing. I eventually settled on the Petkit mini feeder from a cost and design perspective. First of all, it looks great. I love the thought that went into the design from the magnetically attached bowl to the jumper that allows the DC adapter to easily disconnect from the wall should you need. I was a little nervous about how much food could be stored but upon seeing the compartment this is a good amount for a cat. I find we need to fill it once every 2 weeks or so.That brings us to the worst part of the product. Lets just be clear here...the app is decent...but there are some language oddities and the setup did not go according to design. I am a techy and I initially tried pairing the feeder with my phone. It got fairly far into the setup but kept failing out during the wifi pairing process. I then tried my wife\'s phone and it did the same. I then happened to notice that the feeder was already showing on the app\'s dashboard and sure enough it had been paired even though the app claimed it had failed. I don\'t know why this occurred but be prepared for some setup issues.Once setup, however, the app is great. The food portion sizes are accurate and on demand feeds occur nearly immediately. The schedule is easy to setup and food is distributed on time. We use prescription ""disc-shaped"" food and other feeders claimed they weren\'t compatible. We have had ZERO issues with this machine getting jammed or having any issue with our food. It is actually very fun to watch the little door open on the machine and then the food dump out.For the cost, this feeder is a steal. It is so much better than our previous feeder it makes me wonder why I didn\'t upgrade earlier. My only suggestions for improvement would be to further improve the app and instructions translations. There are some real English oddities (which you can see in the product\'s amazon page as well. In addition, the setup process obviously needs some improvement too as it failed twice for me and some how magically appeared on my apps dashboard after this fail. Other than that, the feeder is perfect. It feels very high quality and the mechanics seem sound. HIGHLY recommended.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 29, 2019', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars PetKit Mini - Small Pet Feeder - Review', 'author': 'AirplaneCatBlue', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""The PetKit Mini feeder is attractively and elegantly designed. It looks like it belongs in an art museum.The PetKit Mini feeder is the ideal automatic feeder for my needs. What I like best is that it precisely delivers very small meals (as little as 1/20 of a cup or 5 grams) to my overweight cat up to 10 times per day. In my case I had been feeding my cat 20 grams of cat kibbles twice per day... or 40 grams. My cat was waking me up at 4 AM begging for more food. The PetKit Mini stopped the begging behavior! With the PetKit Mini I was able to schedule 8 feedings of 5 grams each... for a total of 40 grams per day... but spread out over the course of the day and night. This way my cat gets precisely fed her reduced ration and eliminates my tendency to give her a little extra when she begs.The PetKit Mini has improved my cat's relationship with me. She no longer relies on me for food. With the PetKit Mini she visits me often and regularly because she wants my company... not because she wants food. And it has improved my relationship with my cat since I am no longer irritated by her pestering behaviors at 4 AM when she gets hungry.The engineers who designed the PetKit Mini payed very close attention to critical details that separate this feeder from the pack. I studied them all before I made my purchase decision. The silicone rubber paddles that meter the kibbles into the rotary dosing cups are designed to flex so the kibbles don’t jam in the mechanism.The engineers used silicone rubber gaskets to seal out moisture at the feeding door and food reservoir lid. Then they provide a replaceable desiccant pack (those little packs that you often find in a box of new shoes) that absorb any moisture that might otherwise accumulate in your dried food. You can imagine that if your kibbles absorbed moisture from the air and swelled up like a sponge that they wouldn’t feed well in the mechanism. It also keeps the food fresher and prevents mold growth I would think.I found the PetKit Mini was easy to set up. It did help that I had an $8 electronic scale so I could better measure in grams how much I had been feeding my cat. I had been using a very small measuring cup. It was a lot easier to weigh the kibbles than to try to measure the volume of food.I measured the amount of food the PetKit Mini delivered with each feeding. I did this 8 times just to see how repeatable the feedings were. With my dry kibbles the average amount of each feeding was 4.97 grams. Pretty good if you were targeting 5 grams! (The standard deviation was 0.31 grams… who remembers what a standard deviation is???)Since I am only feeding my cat 40 grams per day the food reservoir is large enough for storing a 37 day supply. I can just check the food level once per month to be safe… but the PetKit Mini is designed with a monitor that will alert me when the food is low. What a great feature! It will also remind me every 30 days to replace the desiccant pack. I found some after-market desiccant packs on EBay that will fit the PetKit Mini because I couldn’t find any OEM packs online.This is a great automatic WiFI cat feeder! I liked it so much I bought a second PetKit Mini for my daughter for Christmas. She too has an overweight cat (though not for long).

Unboxing and putting everything together is easy, and so far the feeder has been reliable. That said, I think the app is a lot more complex than it needs to be, and while that can be updated and changed over time, it's important to know what you're getting into.When you go through setup of the feeder and app for the first time, I think the experience is a bit all over the place. There are instruction stickers on the feeder itself, there is a booklet of instructions, there are QR codes and links within the booklet to scan to get to videos that you have to watch for further steps, and then there's setup within the app itself... etc. I think it's just a few too many layers of info and could be pared down significantly. Once everything is setup and you're trying to actually use the app, those same issues of unnecessary layers/ complications continue. The app tries to get you to schedule meals based on feeding recommendations for your pet, so you have to setup a profile for each of your pets first. This sounds minor, but it's quite detailed, and includes a whole lot of information that isn't truly necessary just to make a recommendation for feeding quantity. In the end, a truly informed recommendation would really require nutrition information about your pet food itself, so the whole exercise is a bit silly. I was left feeling a bit unsure of how much of this information I *really* needed or wanted to complete. Once you have been asked about various details for your pet, then you need to schedule fixed meals for each, and again I do appreciate that they tried to include a lot of options for customization, but it's just too much. For one, how do they propose that you make sure the right pet eats the right meal, etc? I think it would be much easier to remove those options, or hide them behind an advanced mode, and just let you set a very simple schedule with set times and quantities. K.I.S.S. you know? Given that the app doesn't interface with bluetooth trackers or smart catboxes or anything like that, I'm not sure I see any need for the pet profiles at all! It just adds complexity for no discernible reason.Beyond the actual cumbersome data entry requirements, I found the interface to be not very intuitive. I had difficulty finding the settings that I actually wanted to look for and find out more about, such as the Alexa integration, and kept getting lost in layers of social media integrations and gamification... which, why? I was looking into trying out the Smart Home integration options, but do I need a community and messaging platform for my smart feeder? Maybe this is more of a cultural thing, I believe the company is based in China, but I just don't need this kind of fluff cluttering up the basic functions of the app. I'd really enjoy it more if they could pull back on these added features, or again, maybe just hide them all in one area of the app called 'Social' or similar, but they seemed to be behind every corner. For me, again it just took away from the experience of feeling like I could find the basic information and functions quickly and easily. Thankfully, apps can be can be improved and refined over time, so I feel that most of those concerns are somewhat secondary. If you plan to use it in a way where you can sit down and get through it, then basically 'set it and forget it', I think it will work well for you. But if you would plan to regularly make any tweaks to your meal plans, I think it would be a not-minor annoyance. I'll also mention that this is something my partner and I considered setting up for aging parents, just as a little convenience item to make their lives easier. After working with it, I don't know if I can comfortably go that direction. I definitely don't feel confident that they would have gotten through any of the initial setup themselves, but I also don't think they could make any on-the-fly changes to the configuration even if the initial steps were done for them. My advice to the developers would be: pare down to the basics and make sure they are quick and intuitive. THEN add extras, but remember they are extras and not your primary functions.Ok, so it seems like I'm coming down kind of harsh. All that said, I do think this product will work just fine for use in my own home. The feeder itself is sturdy and has so far been reliable. While I don't have direct experience with a lot of competing products, I had been taking note of some other design issues I'd noted in some of those competitors and waited to try something that seemed to address them. For one, I don't just appreciate the option for plug-in power and battery backup, for me that's an absolute requirement on something like this. The food storage compartment also seems secure, which was a concern I had because I have one cat that will get into ANYTHING edible that is left out. I'm impressed because he hasn't even tried with this, which also tells me the seals are probably decent and he's not being tempted by the smell of kibble. That also leads me to believe that bugs shouldn't be an issue, though time will tell. I also appreciate that the actual food bowl portion is easily removable, as it just snaps into place with a magnet. Being plastic based, it's important to clean something like that regularly and you and I both know that won't happen if it's a pain point. Ideally, I would really like to see this component and the food storage bin being made out of stainless steel, but maybe that's something that could be incorporated in a future revision as well.Let's wrap this up...On the whole, if you are patient and technologically competent enough to get through the configuration of the app itself, it's a good product that I think you'll be happy with."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 12, 2020', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '1.0 out of 5 stars The PetKit app is nearly useless for this feeder!

I bought this Petkit Automatic Cat Feeder because it promised being able to identify my two cats and calculate their food requirements based on weight and metabolic needs. Using this info I wanted to program daily feedings customized for each cat. This product is another example of decent hardware with poor software implementation. Unfortunately, Petkit and Amazon failed to disclose that the app isn't ready for the hardware. I consider this failure to be a bait and switch scam and I'd return it but I already tossed the package because the delivery person left it in the rain without a plastic wrap for protection.Linking the app and feeder was easy.

So far so good.Next task is to program my two cats into the Feeding Calculator. Entering the name is easy. Enter the weight? The app reverts to a default weight of 6.8 pounds every time. So it fails to update the cats's weights. FAIL! There isn't any obvious way to edit the cat information either. So another FAIL! Interesting is that I have the PetKit Puramax automatic litter box with my cats' weights entered correctly. The feeder links to the info but changes the weights without any input from me. Another FAIL?Next it asks me to enter their cat food. I feed Purina Indoor Cat Food, a very common dry cat food pellet available in any American grocery store. Instead of a simple-to-use barcode reader that searches online and enters the food analysis for me, I have to enter the analysis manually. Okay, needlessly complicated but okay.The app lets me program the feeding schedule but I'm unable to vary the portion size. I ran a few trials and the portion size isn't consistent.

The food tray attaches magnetically so is easy to take off, clean, and re-attach. The food sits inside an inner basket within the feeder, so it keeps all the food crumbs contained.

No. But I’ve been using it for several weeks, occasionally measuring the output, and it feel it is close enough. I also like the built-in camera so I can see the food going into the bowl. I would love for it to be more precise, but it’s the best product I have tried so far.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 19, 2024', 'is_verified': True}]"

A newer model and differences.', 'author': 'Nicholas Ortega', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""Unboxing this, I was at first unimpressed as I pulled the detached shell which felt flimsy and cheap. The knobs for the fan and LED device were very much plastic, despite looking metallic. But worst of all, the vents on the shell are made of a very cheap plastic that flexes under slight pressure. But once attached to the rest of the backpack, the whole thing felt much sturdier.The quality of the backpack half itself is quite good and very comfortable. I spent a few hours at the park the next day with it on and it was by far the most comfortable cat backpack I've worn. It felt quite sturdy with the weight of my pet inside of it. Most importantly, like other models I've used, it didn't flex upon wearing, giving my pet maximum room to move around. It is quite space and my cat is sort of big. I'm very happy with the window tinting and the ventilation seems to hold up. I'm even more happy only the top 70 percent of the shell is exposed by the plastic glass, giving my pet a sense of security when in need of a hiding place.THE FAN: This is the most important part. I can tell it started out as a gimmick, upon seeing other review pictures, the basic design and airflow of the fan seemed incredibly flawed. I can tell this was the main focus for improvement in this bag. The fan is much slimmer and without a vent for direct contact. I can certainly feel the airflow which is somewhat satisfactory for the size. It is certainly audibly quiet and I can feel the breeze easily from 6 inches away, More so if I stick my head in the far opposite corner. The LED is quite bright. I'm happy with this feature.POWER. No battery is included. You must have your own portable USB portable battery. When using the fan on full speed for 3 straight hours, my 10350 MHZ battery pack didn't budge from having 4 power indicators on out of 4.COLOR: There is only ONE color. The blue and pink is pretty nice with the grey back half, it vertainly doesn't make me feel anymore masculine but it's nice. I really wish they had more color options.Make sure you choose the BREEZY DOME 2 in pink/blue for the newest model and I'm sure greater satisfaction. I'm pretty happy with it for the price of 70 USD.I noticed NOBODY had a review of the newer model so I'm going to be that good Samaritan.QUALITY: 4.1/5COMFORT: 4.5/5VALUE: 4.5/5"", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 25, 2022', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars I absolutely love this bag!!', 'author': 'Kelvin M.', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'The media could not be loaded. After doing research on cat backpacks, I finally bit the bullet and decided to purchase this Petkit bag. Needless to say that I am thoroughly impressed by the design and quality of this bag. My cat absolutely loved it as well and I have taken him on three walks since I unboxed it.-The quality of this bag is really impressive for the price. The front of the bag is a very sturdy plastic material and has enough ventilation for Pluto (my cat) to not feel like he is suffocating. The window is tinted and I’m sure that it will come in handy during the summer when the sun is extremely bright.-The back of the backpack is padded, and the straps as well. It’s super comfortable and I didn’t feel any tension on my back/shoulders. The back of the backpack doesn’t cave in, which is great because it optimizes the space for my cat. The bottom of the bag also holds his weight.-The net area is more of a rubber material so you wont need to worry about your cat scratching out of the bag if they do not like it.-The fan and light is really cool and makes this backpack more high-tech than other ones. The light isn’t blinding and the fan is perfect enough to make sure the bag enough is properly ventilated. It powers through USB.I am very happy with this purchase and the quality definitely justifies the price. I work from home so going on walks is important for me, and this bag is now allowing me to take Pluto with me. Hopefully in the future they can offer a variety of colors, but so far I still think this is the best backpack in the market. I purchased two bags before this one which I had to return for a variety of reasons, but I am definitely going to keep this one.

It also has a little pocket where you can store your battery pack. (It does not come with one). The fan has multiple speeds which circulates the air well enough without being too noisy that it will disturb It your kitty’s adventures, and a dimmable light which I haven’t had to use yet. The backpack has a zipper closure, a little washable pad and a loop inside where you could possibly tether a leash. The front is tinted so it won’t get too hot, the straps are sturdy and comfortable.

It's super comfortable to wear. It has a hidden pocket in the back, that I can fit their leashes/harnesses, and a small bag of food. And a side pocket meant for a portable charger. But the fan doesn't work very well so I use it to hold my travel size cleaning stuff incase I need to wipe down the inside. Also the removable bottom didn't hold very well, nor fit well in the first place. so I just took it out and put towels down in its place. But the most important part is that it's so durable that there's absolutely no way they can rip a whole through anything and escape. Other bags have a fabric mesh. But in this bag the mesh is made of a thicker plastic material so it's impossible to claw through. And the whole thing is pretty big. I even used it to bring my puppy to the vet once.TL/DR : comfortable to wear, ferret escape proof, hidden pockets, good sized with lots of room to move about.

As soon as we bring it out of the closet, she turns into a crotchety old lady, kind of like Jekyll and Hyde, but made entirely out of whiskers and lint. She doesn’t hesitate to let us know how she feels about it either, because she howls incessantly the ENTIRE TIME she’s in there, to the point that she “loses her voice” and her meow and purr are squeaky for day or so afterwards. Since she’s been a robustly healthy girl, the carrier situation wasn’t a huge problem, as she only needed to go to the vet for well visits. Unfortunately, as she entered her sunset years, she has taken up the mantle from the late Wilford Brimley and was recently diagnosed with the diabeetus. Her trips to the vet will be more frequent while we figure out to manage her diabetes with prescription food and insulin shots. Because I am a little extra and I love my cat, I decided that she should travel happy, and in style! She is an indoor cat, but she absolutely loves going outside with a harness and leash, which is how we know it’s the carrier itself that she hates. So as soon as her spaceship arrived, I unpacked it and left it out for a few days with the back open for her to get used to it. Today, I put her harness on (which she happily steps into because she knows it means we are going on an outside adventure!) and put her in the spaceship for a short walk outside. Not only did she *not* hate it (as evidenced by the absence of her singing the song of her people for all to hear) she actually seemed quite cozy and was purring! I gave her a treat as soon as I unzipped it to let her out and she is still my friend so I am calling this backpack a success! I haven’t tried the light or the fan yet because she was only in it very briefly. Also worth noting, is that Kimmy is quite small, weighing in at a whopping 9 pounds 3 ounces as of her last trip to the vet, so I can’t say for sure, but I HIGHLY doubt any of my other 3 cats - who happen to be fat, murder mitt wielding freeloaders - would fit in it. Overall, this backpack is reasonably priced, looks adorable, and Kimmy Katdashian definitely prefers it to her cat carrier, so I think this was a good purchase all around.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States April 26, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '3.0 out of 5 stars You have to buy a separate power source!', 'author': 'Living_Lime_Green', 'rating': 3, 'content': 'The backpack I received has clearly been used though it was sold as a new product. There are four ways I know the bag is not new. 1) The clear protective cover on the ‘window’ was simply Saran Wrap and didn’t even cover the entire window; 2) There are no tags or stickers on the bag that would indicate a new product; 3) One of the external ventilation plates has a mark that is not something that would come from shipping or storing- it’s similar to a rust spot; 4) There was dried organic ‘debris’ on the floor pad (definitely food or post-digestion material).The bag itself is fine. The zipper is awful (it’s plastic and I don’t see it lasting long) and there really should be a second set of zippers so that the bag can be zipped from both sides. I suspect that I’ll want/need to take the bag in to have a better zipper installed. You have to have a separate power source for the light/fan to work and I was not aware of that, so it’s disappointing (my fault- should have read the description better). You cannot charge the fan/light.So far, my assessment is that this bag is not worth the price paid. I paid $60 in a lightening deal and I believe the retail is $100. With no power source, I think $20 needs to be knocked off the price. Since I received a used bag, I also feel like I overpaid.**This is the third cat backpack I’ve ordered and received from Amazon in the past week. The first one was sold as new but was clearly a used bag, and it was not the product that was advertised/ordered. The first bag had no outer protective bag, no window covering film, no tags or stickers, no instructions. The second bag (replacement for the first) was identical to the first -still the wrong model, not what I ordered. The second bag had a protective film on the window, and a generic UPC code sticker on the outer plastic bag, so I’m not 100% certain it was used (sold as new), but it sure didn’t feel/look new. No instructions or tags. I decided to go with another bag and seller with this third backpack. Imagine my surprise when this one appears to be used as well.

First off, it's airline-approved, at least for Alaska Airlines in-cabin, on economy. I was worried this wouldn't fit underneath the seat, because Southwest (another reviewer) had larger under-seat margins. But this backpack fit snugly under the seat in front of me. It will slide about halfway underneath the window-side seat. It will NOT fit fully underneath the middle row seat, so you'll need to take note of that when booking your flights / seat assignment. Airport check-in and customs was fine as well - you can ask for a 'private screening room' if you don't want to take your pet out of the carrier.Now onto the fan and light functions: It's just beautiful.Some buyers don't read the short manual it comes with and then complain that the 'fan and light didn't work.' It explicitly states, in the manual (and I'm pretty sure on the box), that the fan and the light requires an external power bank / battery pack to run. That's it. Simply unzip the side pocket and plug your power bank to the USB cable (built into the backpack). The fan automatically turns on for your pet.My power bank is 4 x 3 inches (10cm x 8cm), but the pocket is big enough to house a power bank of 6 inches (15cm) in height. I thought the features sounded too good to be true online, but they're real! Changing the fan setting from 'Auto' is touch-screen enabled, and turning the light on/ off is just a press and hold. The fan power isn't the strongest, so I wouldn't advise relying on it too much. But it does provide a little extra breeze for kitty. And the light works well too.I think the backpack attracted just as much attention as the kitty. Several people commented on it and never seen such a 'high tech' backpack before. I love the aesthetic and everything about this backpack. It is pricey, but well worth it - did I mention I've had to carry my cat on 2 hour walks or so?

They all drink healthy amounts and it keeps them from having expensive vet visits.Plus it\'s powered by an induction plate so I don\'t even have to unplug it to safely fill it or clean it.

I'm Shocked How Good It Is!"", 'author': 'Ryan A. Leemhuis', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'A little background first. We had previously used the Crown Majestic feeder for our cat. It worked fairly well although it was a bit ugly, would occasionally jam and the portion sizes were very hit and miss. We used it until its power connection internally broke and it would only run off batteries which was difficult to keep up with.So that led me on my search for a replacement. There are a lot more options now than there used to be. My main features I was looking for were wifi control and reliability.I found it difficult to narrow down my choice as I found varying reviews and some claimed that a model was terrible and some said it was amazing. I eventually settled on the Petkit mini feeder from a cost and design perspective. First of all, it looks great. I love the thought that went into the design from the magnetically attached bowl to the jumper that allows the DC adapter to easily disconnect from the wall should you need. I was a little nervous about how much food could be stored but upon seeing the compartment this is a good amount for a cat. I find we need to fill it once every 2 weeks or so.That brings us to the worst part of the product. Lets just be clear here...the app is decent...but there are some language oddities and the setup did not go according to design. I am a techy and I initially tried pairing the feeder with my phone. It got fairly far into the setup but kept failing out during the wifi pairing process. I then tried my wife\'s phone and it did the same. I then happened to notice that the feeder was already showing on the app\'s dashboard and sure enough it had been paired even though the app claimed it had failed. I don\'t know why this occurred but be prepared for some setup issues.Once setup, however, the app is great. The food portion sizes are accurate and on demand feeds occur nearly immediately. The schedule is easy to setup and food is distributed on time. We use prescription ""disc-shaped"" food and other feeders claimed they weren\'t compatible. We have had ZERO issues with this machine getting jammed or having any issue with our food. It is actually very fun to watch the little door open on the machine and then the food dump out.For the cost, this feeder is a steal. It is so much better than our previous feeder it makes me wonder why I didn\'t upgrade earlier. My only suggestions for improvement would be to further improve the app and instructions translations. There are some real English oddities (which you can see in the product\'s amazon page as well. In addition, the setup process obviously needs some improvement too as it failed twice for me and some how magically appeared on my apps dashboard after this fail. Other than that, the feeder is perfect. It feels very high quality and the mechanics seem sound. HIGHLY recommended.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 29, 2019', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars PetKit Mini - Small Pet Feeder - Review', 'author': 'AirplaneCatBlue', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""The PetKit Mini feeder is attractively and elegantly designed. It looks like it belongs in an art museum.The PetKit Mini feeder is the ideal automatic feeder for my needs. What I like best is that it precisely delivers very small meals (as little as 1/20 of a cup or 5 grams) to my overweight cat up to 10 times per day. In my case I had been feeding my cat 20 grams of cat kibbles twice per day... or 40 grams. My cat was waking me up at 4 AM begging for more food. The PetKit Mini stopped the begging behavior! With the PetKit Mini I was able to schedule 8 feedings of 5 grams each... for a total of 40 grams per day... but spread out over the course of the day and night. This way my cat gets precisely fed her reduced ration and eliminates my tendency to give her a little extra when she begs.The PetKit Mini has improved my cat's relationship with me. She no longer relies on me for food. With the PetKit Mini she visits me often and regularly because she wants my company... not because she wants food. And it has improved my relationship with my cat since I am no longer irritated by her pestering behaviors at 4 AM when she gets hungry.The engineers who designed the PetKit Mini payed very close attention to critical details that separate this feeder from the pack. I studied them all before I made my purchase decision. The silicone rubber paddles that meter the kibbles into the rotary dosing cups are designed to flex so the kibbles don’t jam in the mechanism.The engineers used silicone rubber gaskets to seal out moisture at the feeding door and food reservoir lid. Then they provide a replaceable desiccant pack (those little packs that you often find in a box of new shoes) that absorb any moisture that might otherwise accumulate in your dried food. You can imagine that if your kibbles absorbed moisture from the air and swelled up like a sponge that they wouldn’t feed well in the mechanism. It also keeps the food fresher and prevents mold growth I would think.I found the PetKit Mini was easy to set up. It did help that I had an $8 electronic scale so I could better measure in grams how much I had been feeding my cat. I had been using a very small measuring cup. It was a lot easier to weigh the kibbles than to try to measure the volume of food.I measured the amount of food the PetKit Mini delivered with each feeding. I did this 8 times just to see how repeatable the feedings were. With my dry kibbles the average amount of each feeding was 4.97 grams. Pretty good if you were targeting 5 grams! (The standard deviation was 0.31 grams… who remembers what a standard deviation is???)Since I am only feeding my cat 40 grams per day the food reservoir is large enough for storing a 37 day supply. I can just check the food level once per month to be safe… but the PetKit Mini is designed with a monitor that will alert me when the food is low. What a great feature! It will also remind me every 30 days to replace the desiccant pack. I found some after-market desiccant packs on EBay that will fit the PetKit Mini because I couldn’t find any OEM packs online.This is a great automatic WiFI cat feeder! I liked it so much I bought a second PetKit Mini for my daughter for Christmas. She too has an overweight cat (though not for long).

Unboxing and putting everything together is easy, and so far the feeder has been reliable. That said, I think the app is a lot more complex than it needs to be, and while that can be updated and changed over time, it's important to know what you're getting into.When you go through setup of the feeder and app for the first time, I think the experience is a bit all over the place. There are instruction stickers on the feeder itself, there is a booklet of instructions, there are QR codes and links within the booklet to scan to get to videos that you have to watch for further steps, and then there's setup within the app itself... etc. I think it's just a few too many layers of info and could be pared down significantly. Once everything is setup and you're trying to actually use the app, those same issues of unnecessary layers/ complications continue. The app tries to get you to schedule meals based on feeding recommendations for your pet, so you have to setup a profile for each of your pets first. This sounds minor, but it's quite detailed, and includes a whole lot of information that isn't truly necessary just to make a recommendation for feeding quantity. In the end, a truly informed recommendation would really require nutrition information about your pet food itself, so the whole exercise is a bit silly. I was left feeling a bit unsure of how much of this information I *really* needed or wanted to complete. Once you have been asked about various details for your pet, then you need to schedule fixed meals for each, and again I do appreciate that they tried to include a lot of options for customization, but it's just too much. For one, how do they propose that you make sure the right pet eats the right meal, etc? I think it would be much easier to remove those options, or hide them behind an advanced mode, and just let you set a very simple schedule with set times and quantities. K.I.S.S. you know? Given that the app doesn't interface with bluetooth trackers or smart catboxes or anything like that, I'm not sure I see any need for the pet profiles at all! It just adds complexity for no discernible reason.Beyond the actual cumbersome data entry requirements, I found the interface to be not very intuitive. I had difficulty finding the settings that I actually wanted to look for and find out more about, such as the Alexa integration, and kept getting lost in layers of social media integrations and gamification... which, why? I was looking into trying out the Smart Home integration options, but do I need a community and messaging platform for my smart feeder? Maybe this is more of a cultural thing, I believe the company is based in China, but I just don't need this kind of fluff cluttering up the basic functions of the app. I'd really enjoy it more if they could pull back on these added features, or again, maybe just hide them all in one area of the app called 'Social' or similar, but they seemed to be behind every corner. For me, again it just took away from the experience of feeling like I could find the basic information and functions quickly and easily. Thankfully, apps can be can be improved and refined over time, so I feel that most of those concerns are somewhat secondary. If you plan to use it in a way where you can sit down and get through it, then basically 'set it and forget it', I think it will work well for you. But if you would plan to regularly make any tweaks to your meal plans, I think it would be a not-minor annoyance. I'll also mention that this is something my partner and I considered setting up for aging parents, just as a little convenience item to make their lives easier. After working with it, I don't know if I can comfortably go that direction. I definitely don't feel confident that they would have gotten through any of the initial setup themselves, but I also don't think they could make any on-the-fly changes to the configuration even if the initial steps were done for them. My advice to the developers would be: pare down to the basics and make sure they are quick and intuitive. THEN add extras, but remember they are extras and not your primary functions.Ok, so it seems like I'm coming down kind of harsh. All that said, I do think this product will work just fine for use in my own home. The feeder itself is sturdy and has so far been reliable. While I don't have direct experience with a lot of competing products, I had been taking note of some other design issues I'd noted in some of those competitors and waited to try something that seemed to address them. For one, I don't just appreciate the option for plug-in power and battery backup, for me that's an absolute requirement on something like this. The food storage compartment also seems secure, which was a concern I had because I have one cat that will get into ANYTHING edible that is left out. I'm impressed because he hasn't even tried with this, which also tells me the seals are probably decent and he's not being tempted by the smell of kibble. That also leads me to believe that bugs shouldn't be an issue, though time will tell. I also appreciate that the actual food bowl portion is easily removable, as it just snaps into place with a magnet. Being plastic based, it's important to clean something like that regularly and you and I both know that won't happen if it's a pain point. Ideally, I would really like to see this component and the food storage bin being made out of stainless steel, but maybe that's something that could be incorporated in a future revision as well.Let's wrap this up...On the whole, if you are patient and technologically competent enough to get through the configuration of the app itself, it's a good product that I think you'll be happy with."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 12, 2020', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '1.0 out of 5 stars The PetKit app is nearly useless for this feeder!

I bought this Petkit Automatic Cat Feeder because it promised being able to identify my two cats and calculate their food requirements based on weight and metabolic needs. Using this info I wanted to program daily feedings customized for each cat. This product is another example of decent hardware with poor software implementation. Unfortunately, Petkit and Amazon failed to disclose that the app isn't ready for the hardware. I consider this failure to be a bait and switch scam and I'd return it but I already tossed the package because the delivery person left it in the rain without a plastic wrap for protection.Linking the app and feeder was easy. Connecting to my home router/wifi was easy. It even ran an automatic software upgrade so I know I have the latest, greatest app software. So far so good.Next task is to program my two cats into the Feeding Calculator. Entering the name is easy. Enter the weight? The app reverts to a default weight of 6.8 pounds every time. So it fails to update the cats's weights. FAIL! There isn't any obvious way to edit the cat information either. So another FAIL! Interesting is that I have the PetKit Puramax automatic litter box with my cats' weights entered correctly. The feeder links to the info but changes the weights without any input from me. Another FAIL?Next it asks me to enter their cat food. I feed Purina Indoor Cat Food, a very common dry cat food pellet available in any American grocery store. Instead of a simple-to-use barcode reader that searches online and enters the food analysis for me, I have to enter the analysis manually. Okay, needlessly complicated but okay.The app lets me program the feeding schedule but I'm unable to vary the portion size. I ran a few trials and the portion size isn't consistent.

The food tray attaches magnetically so is easy to take off, clean, and re-attach. The food sits inside an inner basket within the feeder, so it keeps all the food crumbs contained.

It even has a dessicant (oxygen absorber) you can add to keep food fresh in the feeder. I ended up buying some replacements that you can heat up to reuse as a cost saving measure. This pet kit feeder includes a HD camera and a speaker and microphone if you want to talk to your cats or set recorded messages during feeding times. You can set detailed feeding times and has an easy way to stop a feeding in case you want to feed them wet food. The app can be somewhat buggy at times but never for more than a minute since it fixes itself.

A newer model and differences.', 'author': 'Nicholas Ortega', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""Unboxing this, I was at first unimpressed as I pulled the detached shell which felt flimsy and cheap. The knobs for the fan and LED device were very much plastic, despite looking metallic. But worst of all, the vents on the shell are made of a very cheap plastic that flexes under slight pressure. But once attached to the rest of the backpack, the whole thing felt much sturdier.The quality of the backpack half itself is quite good and very comfortable. I spent a few hours at the park the next day with it on and it was by far the most comfortable cat backpack I've worn. It felt quite sturdy with the weight of my pet inside of it. Most importantly, like other models I've used, it didn't flex upon wearing, giving my pet maximum room to move around. It is quite space and my cat is sort of big. I'm very happy with the window tinting and the ventilation seems to hold up. I'm even more happy only the top 70 percent of the shell is exposed by the plastic glass, giving my pet a sense of security when in need of a hiding place.THE FAN: This is the most important part. I can tell it started out as a gimmick, upon seeing other review pictures, the basic design and airflow of the fan seemed incredibly flawed. I can tell this was the main focus for improvement in this bag. The fan is much slimmer and without a vent for direct contact. I can certainly feel the airflow which is somewhat satisfactory for the size. It is certainly audibly quiet and I can feel the breeze easily from 6 inches away, More so if I stick my head in the far opposite corner. The LED is quite bright. I'm happy with this feature.POWER. No battery is included. You must have your own portable USB portable battery. When using the fan on full speed for 3 straight hours, my 10350 MHZ battery pack didn't budge from having 4 power indicators on out of 4.COLOR: There is only ONE color. The blue and pink is pretty nice with the grey back half, it vertainly doesn't make me feel anymore masculine but it's nice. I really wish they had more color options.Make sure you choose the BREEZY DOME 2 in pink/blue for the newest model and I'm sure greater satisfaction.

The front of the bag is a very sturdy plastic material and has enough ventilation for Pluto (my cat) to not feel like he is suffocating. The window is tinted and I’m sure that it will come in handy during the summer when the sun is extremely bright.-The back of the backpack is padded, and the straps as well.

The bottom of the bag also holds his weight.-The net area is more of a rubber material so you wont need to worry about your cat scratching out of the bag if they do not like it.-The fan and light is really cool and makes this backpack more high-tech than other ones.

As soon as we bring it out of the closet, she turns into a crotchety old lady, kind of like Jekyll and Hyde, but made entirely out of whiskers and lint. She doesn’t hesitate to let us know how she feels about it either, because she howls incessantly the ENTIRE TIME she’s in there, to the point that she “loses her voice” and her meow and purr are squeaky for day or so afterwards. Since she’s been a robustly healthy girl, the carrier situation wasn’t a huge problem, as she only needed to go to the vet for well visits. Unfortunately, as she entered her sunset years, she has taken up the mantle from the late Wilford Brimley and was recently diagnosed with the diabeetus. Her trips to the vet will be more frequent while we figure out to manage her diabetes with prescription food and insulin shots. Because I am a little extra and I love my cat, I decided that she should travel happy, and in style! She is an indoor cat, but she absolutely loves going outside with a harness and leash, which is how we know it’s the carrier itself that she hates. So as soon as her spaceship arrived, I unpacked it and left it out for a few days with the back open for her to get used to it. Today, I put her harness on (which she happily steps into because she knows it means we are going on an outside adventure!) and put her in the spaceship for a short walk outside. Not only did she *not* hate it (as evidenced by the absence of her singing the song of her people for all to hear) she actually seemed quite cozy and was purring! I gave her a treat as soon as I unzipped it to let her out and she is still my friend so I am calling this backpack a success! I haven’t tried the light or the fan yet because she was only in it very briefly. Also worth noting, is that Kimmy is quite small, weighing in at a whopping 9 pounds 3 ounces as of her last trip to the vet, so I can’t say for sure, but I HIGHLY doubt any of my other 3 cats - who happen to be fat, murder mitt wielding freeloaders - would fit in it. Overall, this backpack is reasonably priced, looks adorable, and Kimmy Katdashian definitely prefers it to her cat carrier, so I think this was a good purchase all around.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States April 26, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '3.0 out of 5 stars You have to buy a separate power source!', 'author': 'Living_Lime_Green', 'rating': 3, 'content': 'The backpack I received has clearly been used though it was sold as a new product. There are four ways I know the bag is not new. 1) The clear protective cover on the ‘window’ was simply Saran Wrap and didn’t even cover the entire window; 2) There are no tags or stickers on the bag that would indicate a new product; 3) One of the external ventilation plates has a mark that is not something that would come from shipping or storing- it’s similar to a rust spot; 4) There was dried organic ‘debris’ on the floor pad (definitely food or post-digestion material).The bag itself is fine. The zipper is awful (it’s plastic and I don’t see it lasting long) and there really should be a second set of zippers so that the bag can be zipped from both sides. I suspect that I’ll want/need to take the bag in to have a better zipper installed. You have to have a separate power source for the light/fan to work and I was not aware of that, so it’s disappointing (my fault- should have read the description better). You cannot charge the fan/light.So far, my assessment is that this bag is not worth the price paid. I paid $60 in a lightening deal and I believe the retail is $100. With no power source, I think $20 needs to be knocked off the price. Since I received a used bag, I also feel like I overpaid.**This is the third cat backpack I’ve ordered and received from Amazon in the past week. The first one was sold as new but was clearly a used bag, and it was not the product that was advertised/ordered. The first bag had no outer protective bag, no window covering film, no tags or stickers, no instructions. The second bag (replacement for the first) was identical to the first -still the wrong model, not what I ordered. The second bag had a protective film on the window, and a generic UPC code sticker on the outer plastic bag, so I’m not 100% certain it was used (sold as new), but it sure didn’t feel/look new. No instructions or tags. I decided to go with another bag and seller with this third backpack. Imagine my surprise when this one appears to be used as well.

First off, it's airline-approved, at least for Alaska Airlines in-cabin, on economy. I was worried this wouldn't fit underneath the seat, because Southwest (another reviewer) had larger under-seat margins. But this backpack fit snugly under the seat in front of me. It will slide about halfway underneath the window-side seat. It will NOT fit fully underneath the middle row seat, so you'll need to take note of that when booking your flights / seat assignment. Airport check-in and customs was fine as well - you can ask for a 'private screening room' if you don't want to take your pet out of the carrier.Now onto the fan and light functions: It's just beautiful.Some buyers don't read the short manual it comes with and then complain that the 'fan and light didn't work.' It explicitly states, in the manual (and I'm pretty sure on the box), that the fan and the light requires an external power bank / battery pack to run. That's it. Simply unzip the side pocket and plug your power bank to the USB cable (built into the backpack). The fan automatically turns on for your pet.My power bank is 4 x 3 inches (10cm x 8cm), but the pocket is big enough to house a power bank of 6 inches (15cm) in height. I thought the features sounded too good to be true online, but they're real! Changing the fan setting from 'Auto' is touch-screen enabled, and turning the light on/ off is just a press and hold. The fan power isn't the strongest, so I wouldn't advise relying on it too much. But it does provide a little extra breeze for kitty. And the light works well too.I think the backpack attracted just as much attention as the kitty. Several people commented on it and never seen such a 'high tech' backpack before.

I purchased a size medium, and my dog is 12 pounds and she is very slender and tall. I would say that if your dog also is tall I would not recommend this carrier because it is wide and short. When my dog stands up a good part of her body sticks out of the top. She can fit in it much better when she laying down. My dog is very cuddly and enjoys being with me at all times. She loves it so far, but I have not had her in it for anytime longer than an hour.It is made very well, and I like the design of the straps. There are 2 straps like a backpack would have, one strap that goes around your stomach.This carrier was surprisingly sturdy. It has a flat bottom, and if the straps are tightened properly the carrier will not wobble or move too much. There is a hook inside the carrier that you can hook onto your dog\'s collar or harness to keep them from jumping out. There is a draw string at the top of the bag that can be tighten to secure your dog at the top. Without the draw strings being tightened there isn\'t anything other than the hook attached to your dogs collar stopping the dog from jumping out. There is not much cushion to the carrier, so I do not believe that the carrier is supposed to be used for long periods of time. If your dog is small enough there may be room to add a blanket or towel too add some comfort.I really like the color of the blue carrier, it is much more pretty that the color blue that is in the picture. The carrier is blue and gray where in the picture it is black and gray. The little pockets are great for treats or poop bags.Overall, I think this is a great little carrier that can be used for shorter amounts of time. It is a great price. My dog loves this carrier because she isn\'t ""zipped in."" It is very open, so she does not feel like she is being put in a crate. If you have a dog that LIKES being in close quarters with you and likes to be carried, I would recommend this. I think a carrier working out for your pet definitely depends on your pets personality.So I would recommend this if: you have a small dog (around 10lbs or less and has shorter legs), if your dog likes to be carried and to be close to you, if you don\'t plan on using this for several hours at a time, and if you are okay with it having an open top (as in if you leaned over, your dog could jump or fall out of it).', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 27, 2016', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Outward Hound PupPak Dog Front Carrier: A Comfortable and Convenient Solution for Pet Parents', 'author': 'Morgan', 'rating': 4, 'content': ""The Outward Hound PupPak Dog Front Carrier in Medium, Grey, is an excellent choice for pet owners seeking a comfortable and secure way to carry their furry friends. This front carrier is designed with both the pet's and owner's comfort in mind, making it ideal for walks, hikes, or any adventure where you want to keep your dog close.One of the key features of this carrier is its ergonomic design.

Faulkner', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I think there's a lot of confusion over this product, what its function is, and how to wear it.Background: I have a 5.8 lb poodle (with fluff, collar, and ID tag) that's a Stage V Clinger. He wants to be wherever I am, and I also enjoy taking him places. I've been wanting a front style carrier so he can see out and so I can see him. Enter this carrier.Fit: I ordered a medium and a small, based on the reviews, even though my Tiny Tyrant is less than 6 lbs. Medium: We received the medium first, and I felt like it was too big. Puppers couldn't lay down (not the point of this carrier, anyway), and the pouch came up to just below his chin, because once he's off those long legs, he's normal sized (for a tiny dog), so he didn't really want to sit down in the carrier. The straps also felt oddly loose, and my dude just looked uncomfy. Small: We received the small a few days later, and BINGO. Puppers gladly sat down in the carrier. The pouch came up to his chest, so he wasn't trying to keep it out of his face. He looked infinitely more comfortable in the small than he did in the medium. I read the instructions and, guess what? YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO CROSS THE STRAPS BEHIND YOUR BACK!!!! This made the carrier feel secure on my body, and the stability helped puppers relax and be comfortable that he wasn't going to slip off into the ether world at any given moment. Success. I wore it around the house while I picked up for about half an hour. When I finally sat down, he didn't hop out like he did with the medium. I'd call this a success.Cliff notes: A small is appropriate for a less than 10lb dog. Cross the straps behind your back. Doggie should sit, not lay down.

The stretchy cord on the bag\'s opening is not even attached to the bag. It was in the 2 opening holes with the part that is supposed to tighten, but it is detached. When I pulled on the cord with the plastic part to tighten the top of the bag, it just detached from the bag, I couldn\'t tighten the bag at all to make sure my dog is secure. There is no harness clip or anything inside the bottom of the bag to make sure your dog won\'t squirm out or jump. There is a little bit of padding at the bottom but it is not fleece or similar softer material like other carriers.Obviously you would ideally pay attention while the dog is in. But if you\'re using it as a backpack like advertised, as opposed to forward facing, you won\'t see your pup. If they move or squirm around, this stretchy cord at the top that bunches the backpack around the dog\'s neck could come right off. Your dog would fall off from above your waist height if you use it like a backpack. I feel lucky that I found out about this design flaw and the poor construction before my dog and I went outside of the house.Second, the way your dog gets in the backpack. You will have to pick up your dog and set them in there. If you are thinking of purchasing this item to help a potentially older dog or any pet with mobility problems, you should know with the bucket design, they will have to be carried into it and there is a good chance they will be kind of squished until they settle into a comfortable position. Both my dogs hated trying to get in this. I\'ve seen others with the design where the dog / cat just walks into the carrier / backpack and you just zip it once they\'re in.Also, this bag is for dogs that are ""XS"" or ""extra small"". We have 2 chihuahua mixes, the smaller one who is 7 lbs can just about fit in it. The bigger one has a ""small"" sized harness (rather than an extra small, and he absolutely would not fit.

He's a long slender fellow with lots of energy, the NEED to explore the outdoor world, and the will to do so on his own terms. I also have the will to do things on my own terms so things have come to a head with the two of us. I want him to be as compliant as my aussiedoodle on hikes without having to expend the hours and hours to teach him to heel, he wants to do the danger things without the inhibition of an ever insistent leash to pull him in a safer direction/keep him from hightailing it away from strangers on the trail and scampering away at 30 miles away to his impending doom (think coyote bait). I thought this would be a good solution to our battle of wills. He could enjoy the glory of the outdoors while simultaneously remaining safe from predators and I could hike without being beholden to Percy. When it arrived, I thought it would work out well for us. Percy Circus and his littermate, Pogues jumped in and out of it when I set it on the floor, and when I tried it on, it felt comfortable and sturdy. I think it's important to note here that while this is advertised as a front carrier, it can also be worn as a backpack just as easily. This is the configuration I opted for, but I tried both methods out. The first time I tried it out, however, he jumped from the top of the carrier before I had managed to leave the property by way of back gate and hung by his harness from the harness attachment outside of the carrier until I was able to trot inside (while trying to contort my body to support his weight with my arm while he dangled behind me) and readjust. I placed him back in the carrier (which felt a bit like trying to squeeze a wet bar of soap without losing control) pulled the drawstring as tight as I could around his shoulders, hoisted the pack back on my shoulders, and voila, out he went again, dangling like before. I tried to press his whole body down into the carrier and pull the drawstring completely closed so there would be no chance of escaping. Cats are amazing in their ability to defy the odds you try to put in their way. The critter dangled on the outside of the carrier for the third and final time. I returned the carrier. The bottom line I think is that this is a good carrier for small animals who aren't likely to leap out at the first chance they get.

Your puppy or adult has to be able to lay down in the carrier to prevent back injuries with those long backs. Carriers where they have to sit up are just not very comfortable or safe for a long back puppy. Now, finding carriers that allow this is not as easy as one would think. Not many carriers actually allow them to lie down like this. When I saw this carrier, I knew it was one I would need to try. My puppy is only 13 weeks old (9 weeks when I got her) so I could not put her on a leash and just walk her as she was not fully vaccinated and our vet said not until she is 22 weeks old. This means, a lot of carrying puppy in my future. I needed a carrier. This one works and is comfortable for both of us!I put a blanket inside to give her something soft to lay on, and throw a couple of her favorite toys inside and she is happy.PROS:The carrier has a collar/harness clip inside to hook to her harness to keep her safe and prevent her from jumping out.There is a very nice, large pocket on it where you could keep training treats, your keys, or wallet. My phone fits perfectly in this pocket which is very convenient.When she is in the carrier, the shoulder strap is very comfortable for me.The sides are adjustable to make sure she can see, get in and out, and keep her level on my hip.There are nice side vents to allow for air flow through the carrier, not just over it.CONS:I do wish that the adjustable side straps were on the opposite end as the collar/harness clip because she thinks it is a great chew toy but that is the only thing I would see as a con.Overall, I do see it as a great carrier for any puppy but very useful for my mini dachshund and any other long back puppers out there.Would be great if they made it in other colors as well, but the grey is very nice and I cannot complain.

And it might be that, except for the poor construction techniques used. The photo I uploaded shows the start of my repair effort. The carrier failed within 10 minutes of receiving its occupant. The drawstring is supposed to be securely fastened and drawn closed to keep the animal safely inside. But...the method used to secure the drawstring on the left side failed, rendering the carrier useless. I opted to make my own repairs and avoid a replacement, which likely would have the same shoddy workmanship. I cut the frayed end of the loose drawstring and used a small torch to melt the nylon. Next I shall install a metal grommet on the far left side of the carrier, similar to the ones at the front of the carrier. Then I'll slit the nylon to allow the drawstring to be passed through the grommet, and secure the drawstring on that side with a small button or keeper.It is obvious that whoever designed this product never tried to use it. Burying the securing end of the drawstring inside the fabric and somehow attaching it where the attachment can (will) fail is sloppy design, and shows very poor engineering.

I will get a better sense of this once we are out hiking and will update my review. Just a suggestion – before you order one of these for larger dog, try on a regular knapsack filled with something that approximates his weight.

We flew US Airways and despite the large size being slightly bigger than required dimensions, we had zero problems whatsoever. Here are a few answers to questions I had before flying that may help ease your concerns:1. US Air did not check that he could stand up or turn around2. It was tight, but he could, in fact, stand up and turn around3. US Air did not check any health certificates- all I had to do each way was sign a short form that the person at the counter filled out on my behalf. Although I was very nervous about getting turned away due to the size of the carrier, I acted like we had done this a million times (unlike the woman in line next to me with a dog that did not stop barking/squealing for the entire 15 min I was next to her). We both had a large Sherpa carrier and we both got through.4. The strap is extremely sturdy and my dog felt comfortable with me holding him through the airport5. I brought a blanket with me to cover the carrier in case it didn\'t fit completely under the seat. The carrier DID fit with a little squishing and maneuvering, but since the flight atttendants on some of the flights were very strict, I used it to be able to pull the carrier out from under the seat mid-flight and give my little guy some reassuring pats on the head. The blanket was also helpful when my late night flight had all the lights on- I wanted my dog to sleep and be relaxed, so I covered the holes. When it got very warm mid-flight, I threw him a few ice cubes to rehydrate.6. TRAINING: To get my Westie ready for his first flight, I bought the carrier about 2 weeks before. The first day or two, I motioned with treats and he walked in himself. I left the top open so he wouldn\'t feel claustrophobic. Once he was comfortable with the ""box"" (as we called it), I started closing the front door and placing him in the top hole (again, always with treats). I didn\'t let him walk out on his own after this part of the training; I wanted him to know that once he was in his box, he couldn\'t leave without me taking him out. Once he became comfortable sitting in the box, I put a treat on the bottom and as soon as he put his head down to get it, I zipped the lid and let him enjoy his treat in there. I expected him to freak out the first time (my dog is not well-trained by any means; he will not even sit on command most days), but he stayed calm, so after about 5 minutes of me sitting by his box, I picked it up, did a few laps around the apartment, went down the elevator, loaded him up in the car and took a short drive to the pet store. He didn\'t mind at all. After I saw that, we toned down the training to every couple of days. Some nights after work, I would put him in his box (always through the top and always with a treat before the lid was closed) and put him at my feet while I watched TV for an hour or two. I would never walk away from the box and occasionally gave him reassuring pats or words of encouragement every 30 mins or so. Due to time constraints, we never trained for staying in the box longer than 2 hours, despite us having about a 7 hour trip time with the layovers. A few training tips: buy soft treats and use VERY tiny pieces. Especially at the beginning, you will likely be going through quite a few treats, so the smaller, the better. You don\'t want your dog throwing up in there (or expecting large treats on the plane!) Also, never give in to your dog if he/she tries to bite its way out of the bag. Stop the behavior and do not let it out of the carrier until the behavior has stopped and some time has passed. This is not fun to deal with mid-flight, so stop the behavior before you get in the air.7. To help with his ears popping, I brought several nylabones on the plane (the pocket on the carrier is perfect for a few treats, a collapsible water bowl, a potty pad for layovers if you don\'t have time to take your dog out between flights, and a Kindle for yourself). During takeoff, I handed him a bone (I put PB on them so he would lick and bite) as I pet him. He\'s used to car rides, so this didn\'t phase him much.8. Every so often throughout the flight, I would unzip a tiny hole (he did want to escape, so I had to be careful) and give him a small piece of treat to check on him.9. The mesh on this carrier is STURDY. My dog has a bite similar to a pitbull, and the determination of a 6 year old trying to reach a giant piece of candy that was put just out of reach, so when he started trying to eat his way out of the carrier during the last 30 mins of the flight, every scenario of him running through the aisles like a mad man started running through my head. Luckily, however, the mesh held up and we landed safely shortly thereafter. I was left with a bruised hand due to the struggle, but the bag was just fine.10. Day of flight: check in with plenty of time to spare. This is not the time to add stress. Once your bags are checked in and your dog has the ""ok"" to fly, check out the security line. If it\'s short, I recommend walking out of the airport and giving your dog some last-minute fresh air, one last bathroom stop, and a moment for the vet-recommended Benadryl to kick in. When the time comes to go through security, you\'ll put the carrier through (I also had a backpack with the blanket tied to it and a large coat) and carry your dog through the x-ray machine. I put my dog back in the carrier at this point, but if your dog\'s leash is easily accessible, you could probably get away with walking it on its leash to the gate (at least that seemed to be the case at SAN, PHX & MKE). You\'ll want to be one of the last to board (you won\'t have luggage, so carry on space won\'t be a concern). If you have a layover, check out potty areas ahead of time. Few airports have potty areas behind security (SAN is one), so you\'ll need to know what your options are and if you\'ll have time. During our short layover, I had planned to take my dog to the bathroom stall and lay out a potty pad. Since he had just gone about 90 min prior however, we spent our 20 mins between flights with his head poking out of the carrier while he observed the craziness of Thanksgiving travel. If I could do this again, I would have taken him on a quick walk in the airport to burn off some energy.All in all, flying with my Westie was much less stressful for him than boarding. The large Sherpa was great and I would highly recommend it.

I found this carrier in a local feed store, and it was the only one that had the features I was looking for--manageable size (big enough for cats, small enough to carry), structured enough to not envelope an animal, but with the flexibility to get squished a bit to fit in unyielding spaces.I bought this (for substantially more than they sell on Amazon) and have been happy with the purchase. More to the point, the cats are happy with the carrier. I leave it open in the living room in a place they associate with play, and I often find them resting or sleeping in the carriers.I have three cats, and the two smaller (10 lbs each) cats have made vet trips in one carrier. The sturdy clip-on strap hooks over the headrest in the car, and I clip the seat belt around the strap (not the carrier body).The base has a velcro'd-in, removable fabric-covered board that can be taken out to clean, and a soft sherpa-covered removable pad for washing. I bought a two-pack of spare pads. These are machine washable, but come out a bit roughened up--I'd recommend giving them a hand wash unless they get dire. And the replacements are inexpensive enough to dispose of a badly-soiled pad if that seems necessary.These collapse flat for storage if desired. I'm just leaving them out for the girls to hang in so that a trip is less traumatic. Seems to work. I didn't hear a peep out of them during the last trip in. (Getting two cats in one carrier, however, was a bit of a clown act. I recommend getting both cats and the carrier in a small room with doors shut before you begin.I think my earlier shopping difficulty was trying to find something that would meet all my possible carrier needs, trying to find something convenience for a vet run AND comfortable for international travel with long layovers. Necessity taught me that the reality is we'll need this for short local runs much more often than longer trips, and if I need to, I can get something different. For today, this ticks all the boxes.If you're in the same quandary I was in, I can tell you that these are well-made, seem very affordable, and the cats are so comfortable in them they hang out there.

The box for this medium carrier states that the carrier actually measures 17"" L, 11""W, 10.5""H (not 18""L), NOT 18"" L as described in Amazon ad. Hey, an inch is an inch when stuck under a seat for hours. That said, the medium carrier is acceptable to airlines (I verified by phone and by checking in advance with a United agent.) The Sherpa medium size appears OK for my rather tall 13 lb cat. When zipped up, she is able to change positions and lie down ok but not able to sit-up or stand up. [I\'m unaware of any acceptable in-cabin airline carrier that would allow her to sit up or standup while stuck under a standard airline seat]. Compared with a similar carrier made by Petmate, this Sherpa is well designed, has firm and comfy, and is made of better materials (outer material and netting are thicker, zippers are more substantial, and flooring firmer). Like the Petmate, it has good venting on three sides, two ways to enter or open carrier on top and one end, good shoulder and hand straps, and pocket for treats etc. Caution: it stinks when removed from box and requires at least 3 days on my deck to air out so give yourself plenty of time before using it. As other reviews suggest, I\'m leaving it out so cat can get used to seeing it. I also am playing kitty games with it at least once a day for several weeks before flying. My somewhat shy cat is responding well as she jumps in and out of the open carrier to retrieve her favorite treats that I toss into the carrier. I also have zipped her into it and started walking around the house so she gets familiar with being inside and moving around airport --when we get to that stage. NOW...to the stage that I have been fretting about -- how to get through TSA security screening without getting my eyes scratched out AND without losing my cat who simply hates being picked up and held for more than two seconds in her own home without any strangers or commotion. Add to this potential disaster, how do I keep her calm while I oversee the same process with my second cat who will be traveling with me and my companion? After losing a lot of sleep, I finally went to local airport and talked with a TSA rep who explained their procedures if we want private screening or feel that cannot safely hold each cat and walk with them in our arms. First, the TSA rep emphasized that anyone can obtain a private TSA screening in a nearby room for that purpose. Second, he explained that the humans (me and my human companion) may go through the usual screening while a TSA rep takes the two cat carriers (with cats safely zipped in them) to the private screening room where we must remove each cat so TSA can check the carriers. What a relief! The process sounds appropriate and doable, especially if I place a light blanket in each carrier and use the blanket to gently hold and sooth the cat while they check the carriers. I hope all this detail is helpful to others who need to fly with a small pet in the cabin for the first time. Since this carrier seems acceptable to airlines and my cat, I just order a second carrier for her sister who is sucker for treats and is not frightened by it. I\'ll post an update after our October trip, which includes one 2.5 hour flight to Denver with a plane change and then a second flight into Tucson.

I had to get it from another pet products website to get the original price of less than $30. So if you\'re looking at this for the first time, beware. It\'s a really nice carrier, but for $80, look elsewhere.This is a great carrier! It\'s large enough for a big male Ragdoll cat. Even has a little ring inside which I figured was to hang a toy from and a zippered compartment in the back for medicine or anything else your pet may need during the trip. It folds ""semi"" flat for storage which is nice too. It looks like a black leather carrier, very chic! The handles snap together at the top and are comfortable to carry and the longer strap is a nice plus, especially if you want to hang it around your back car seat headrests for extra security.

It comes with a hard covered board to make it stiff on the bottom, plus a comfy pad for your kitty to lay on which is washable (just in case)! Has mesh screens around both sides and front so kitty can see watch everything but still feel safe inside it (top/back are covered). Most important, it opens with zippers from the top or front for those picky kitties that don\'t like to walk into a carrier because they know they are going to the vet (and you can lock the zippers if needed). We don\'t use it for airplane travel (our kitties fend for themselves when we\'re away on weekend trips) but I believe this one can be used, especially since it will ""squish"" a little at the top to fit under airline seats.

It has a soft fleecy fake sheepskin floor mounted on a 1/8"" or 3/16"" rigid board, so your pet has a solid floor. I have used it on three flights so far, seems to hold up well. Zipper fits tight, zips tight. Small flat pocket on the side for treats, poop bags and I fit in some flat folded paper towels in case there is a leak (from my dog).

The middle seat has the most foot room with slightly more generous width between the bench seat support. The window seat has the least room due to the curvature of the fuselage eating back into the floor space.

I wear size 9 shoes, 145 lbs and 5\'8"" so not that big, your mileage, as they say, may vary, especially if you have a big guy sitting next to you. I believe the aisle seat also offers the best ventilation / air circulation.

The large size does not fall under Sherpa’s “Guaranteed On Board” program either because Sherpa says some airlines may not allow the large bags on. I tried the medium size, but my dogs looked way too squished with how small they were. The large size gave my dogs so much more room, and I even put some blankets and a small pillow in there. The large sized bags fit easily on a small Alaska Airlines plane, E-175 (see 3rd pic). They fit both the long and wide way. We had premium seats with more leg room so I’m not sure about economy seating. They also fit easily under a Southwest flight and slid right under a window and aisle seat (2nd pic). We flew ANOTHER Alaska Airlines flight FIRST CLASS — this time on a regular Boeing plane — and the carrier slid right under on the aisle side but with the window seat, the carrier had to be squished down a little to fit under (1st pic).

It’s all one piece and unzips to fold flat which makes it so easy to store. The front and back both unzip on three sides to fold flat. The only frame is in those panels that unzipped to fold flat, which is a great idea. When these panels are zipped in place, it gives the carrier plenty of shape and support. But if you unzip the whole front panel, the front loses its shape. That part is meant to stay zipped when in use. The front does have a separate door that unzips so you can leave the frame in place while accessing the cat. Makes it so easy to use and to store. I love this idea.The self locking zippers are wonderful. They look and act just like ordinary zippers but when zipped closed, there’s a little catch right before it gets started opening which is exactly what I need. My 12 pound male, he has figured out how to unzip his carriers. I normally have to keep carabiners on all his zippers. My vet calls him Houdini.I love the extra strap. It can be adjusted to use as a shoulder strap or more importantly to hook over the headrest in the car. I always use the seatbelt to buckle the carriers in, this will be much easier.Very good size. I have two 13-year-old cats that weigh 12 pounds each and there’s plenty of room for either. There’s also plenty of room for my two 5 month old kittens to travel together.There’s a matching food bowl that Velcro to the front door. It looks pretty deep for a cat, she has to put her whole head in, but that’s okay because my cats never want to eat when they’re in the carrier anyway.

While the carrier doesn't hold its shape as well as my other one, it is fine when one end is zipped up to provide more support. I put my cat in a bathroom with the door closed, which she hates, and then placed the carrier entrance against the door opening so that she had to enter the carrier if she wanted to leave the bathroom. That is my usual technique and it worked fine with this carrier.2) The manufacturer messaged me after my original review offering a full refund if I was unsatisfied with the carrier. I am impressed when a brand stands by its products and provides good customer care. I opted to keep this carrier because it is a definite improvement over the hard case carrier it replaced. While not quite as nice as my other soft side carrier, this AT1NTN carrier works fine and is a good value at this price point.Original Review: This carrier seems good enough to serve the purpose of taking my large ragdoll cats to the vet. However, when one entrance is unzipped, it doesn’t hold its shape as well as my other soft carrier, which may make it a bit harder to get my nervous cat inside and the carrier zipped up. The mesh and canvas fabric seems strong enough but not as durable as on other carriers that I have owned. The side straps to carry the bag seem very secure and the zippers seem good although they were initially a bit hard to zip based on the shape of the fabric curves; the zippers were much easier to open and close after the first time. I would not trust the plastic clips holding the long strap to carrier this like a shoulder bag, but I wouldn’t use that strap regardless. I also would never use the cloth food cup provided with the carrier, which is oddly sized for a cat. That said, the carrier has a fluffy fabric covered, rigid bottom piece that slips inside and Velcros in place, and it also includes a cheap feeling but fluffy bed that can either be used instead of the rigid bottom piece with Velcro to attach it to the carrier bottom, or it can be placed on top of the other rigid piece like I chose to do,I am not usually sensitive to smell but this carrier definitely has a strong chemical smell when first removed from its plastic packing material. I am letting it air out in my garage in hopes the smell will disapate in a few days. (Uodate: The smell was gone within two days.)Bottom line, this is an okay mid-level cat carrier but not as nice as the one I already own. I will keep it as a spare since I have two cats.

It did not specify any certain type of cat or size of cat. I liked how this carrier looked and performed but it was much too small for my cat. And he isn\'t even full grown yet. So, when I saw this cat carrier that clearly said it is for large cats I wanted to see if I can use it and if what they say is true. When it arrived, I was happy to see that it is plenty big for my kitty. And will be still down the road when he is older and bigger. He looks like he is going to be a pretty big cat, so I have to think about these things. However, even though it is plenty large enough for an adult cat, even if that cat was a fluffy overweight cat, I don\'t see it being big enough for two adult cats like it states in their listing. At least not if you want them to be comfortable and be able to turn around. This carrier to my surprise had two different soft carpet like lining for it.

I don\'t care about the fact that if you unzip one of the zippers it starts to fold down immediately. There is nothing holding this carrier up but the two zippers on each side being zipped up. So, no frame at all. I guess that is why it is called a ""soft sided"" cat carrier. If you look at the listing photo though of where they have a picture of the cat carrier and there are 4 numbered squares with pictures. It shows in the first and second numbered picture the cat carrier standing upright and stiff on its own while both sides are completely unzipped. This is misleading and false. This cannot happen. The reason they have this collapsible ""soft sided"" type of carrier is because of the storage feature of being able to easily fold it down and put it away somewhere indoors without taking up much space. And this is a nice feature, but I think personally I would rather have a cat carrier that had some kind of frame and can stay upright on its own whether or not a zipper is unzipped.

When you unzip the front the entire thing is collapsible, which is normal, but the supports to hold the entire carriers shape is in the front flap portion of the carrier. You zip the larger section of the front flap up, then UNZIP the smaller door section on the same flap and it holds up fine. Additionally if you zip everything up and use the top flap to put your furry friend in it's even more stable.I personally didn't find the pet feeder thing useful but thats only because my cat doesnt like to stick his head in things even if food is involved. It does hold a bit of foot and can attach to the inside of the carrier to feet a pet in transit somewhere.There was also a pet bed and soft pet mat included in the carrier as well as a shoulder strap (like if you were holding a duffel bag) or your tradition two straps together to carry it by hand.

My pics show the smaller opening. Don't unzip the wider part around the edge and don't unzip the back and it will keep its shape perfectly. Use the small front opening or the top. I only put my cats inside via the top so I don't care about the side entries anyway.CONS:- Arrives stinky and you'll need to air it out. Something like a new car smell related to the materials or packaging, idk. Mine was fine after sitting out for a few days.- More colors, please. I would have preferred more color options, like blue and green.- Base mats should be hand washed. It comes with two removable mats made of fleece on top. One is flat and the other has sides and is a little more cozy and bed-like. I love them but they aren't very practical for vet visits because your cat could be in panic mode and may have an accident. You want something that can be easily cleaned and washed if this is solely for vet visits or if your cats are never outside. I would not put either of these mats in the wash. The flat one is stiff with Velcro on the bottom- definitely not. The one with sides has a zipper/Velcro and you can remove the hard mat inside but the fleece is still attached to different material with a zipper and Velcro. We've decided they would best be cleaned via hand washing only. We're going to clean them with the hose in the backyard if there are any pet accidents in there.- There is a cup-shaped bag for pet food that can stick to the inside via Velcro. I only use this for vet visits so this is useless for me. My cats freak on vet days and they aren't going to be eating. No way.I would recommend this. I might buy another if they get more color options. At the very least, I will keep the measurements because it is a very comfortable size for my cats.Measurement: 17.7” L x 11.8” W x 12.6” HMax load: 22 lbs (no more than 18 lbs recommended)"", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 8, 2024', 'is_verified': False}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars This will be much better for vet trips than the plastic hard carriers!', 'author': 'Candice', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I have two cats - one is a 17 pound huge tomcat, and the other a petite female, probably around 10-12 pounds.

If I sat down, he would find a way to get in my lap. I bought this so he could be close to me, yet still comfortable. I carried him into the office with me, where he slept on my desk or in my lap all day. Sometimes I also carried him around the house in it. He loved this little sling.

My dog was about 8 pounds by the time I used this for him, and I felt like he was supported adequately. I didn\'t feel like the sling was going to fall apart on me. And it was soft to snuggle into. I did put a pee pad on the bottom of it to catch some slight incontinence problems. I felt silly purchasing a dog carrier, but I\'m so glad I did.

And yes, it was far too long. With my 7 lb kitten, the sling was about to my crotch. At this length, I\'d end up kicking my cat as I walked. Then I put my 13 lb dog in, and her weight unfortunately popped one of the seams.That was alright though, because I was planning on shortening the strap anyway! I first folded the strap on itself on the end where the seam popped (opposite that cute embroidery so I wouldn\'t be cutting that off). Then I safety-pinned it in place, and wore it with my kitten inside to make sure I had it where I wanted it to be. It ended up being right at the top of my hip, which seems much better than sagging at my thighs. I then cut off the excess length, which ended up being 9 inches. The leftover fabric makes a cute scarf for your small kittens or puppies! I then sewed the two ends together with a pretty terrible whip stitch, and went around twice to make sure it would be strong. Then I did the ultimate test, and put my 12 lb dog back in, and the still the sewing held!I even went as far as to put my kitten in with my dog and it held, so this sling can hold at least 20 lbs. After doing this bit of cosmetic work, I am very pleased with the sling. My kitten and dog are both very comfortable in it, and it is also very comfortable to wear.

I got this for my daughter to put her hamster in, but a baby hamster is little, and I worry it might be able to squeeze through the holes. To be honest, I've never had a hamster, so maybe it can't squeeze out, but that is a bit concerning. I have seen reviews and can see how the mess on the side could be concerning as rodents are known to chew on things, but I haven't seen any animals having made it through. The base pad is hard, which is, again, good for stability. I will probably get another carrier for longer periods of travel or keeping her hamster in, but will keep this for when she wants to carry her hamster around the house, which I know she will. At least if it gets out, it'll be in the house and she can hopefully get it before it gets somewhere she can't.

It is also a little too tall for her to pop her head out comfortably, which I guess doesn’t matter since there is no tether so I could never allow her to do that.

I've found that - now that airlines won't accept Emotional Support Animals - they tend to be more lenient with carrier size. Ideally, our dog will sleep through most of the flight any way. We don't fully enclose her until the last possible second and then let her out as soon as we arrive. Being in a cramped carrier as a small dog is no different than me (a human) being in a cramped airline seat - it's OK for the short trips but no way would it work for, like, a 12 hour flight.

A small half-moon zippered mesh panel on one side is just right for being able to reach in to deliver treats, medications, or just being able to touch your pet for comfort, but the opening isn't big enough for them to escape out of. That's a nice touch. There are two pockets for storage of supplies and a clear windowed pouch on one end for a business-card sized ID card.

The other is quite unpleasant and is going back, but this one, oh how I (and Boo) LOVE this one! I got the black option and the fabric is DREAMY soft and I expect her fur to brush off easily. There are darts that make it very roomy for her to be in any position she wants, but in no way too large. There is also an ample place for my phone and driver's license that securely zips closed! Awesome! She's happily sleeping in the sling as I type. Don't hesitate, you will love this!UPDATE: We have had this treasure almost two years now and it has been used almost daily and often for most of the day. It is still something I thank God for. It is WONDERFUL! It launders well too and is still so soft. The only less than perfect issue is the phone pouch. I have an iPhone6 and though it fits in great, but the zipper made it a bit difficult to remove. About half a year ago the zipper tore out. It was nice to be able to zip it closed for rain and just to be sure it didn't fall out when bending over, but I still use it just fine. I love this sling and so does my Baby Boo! I'm so very grateful for it. I would recommend EVERYONE with a little fur baby to buy one.

Thought I was going crazy trying to put this thing together… but in looking back thru the photos in the listing, I finally realized that they did not have the same features though they look very similar!Mine has several parts that still have me somewhat confused as to what they’re for… but it dies appear nice enough for vet visits… not so sure about a trip on an airline with your furbaby!! Maybe it’ll prove me wrong but it seems pretty wobbly and the material somewhat questionable…? Has an area on one end that seems almost scuffed?! Few strings here and there too but nothing you can’t trim up.As far as differences:First off the sides are different as you can see in my photos and video- I’m good with that part!😉 it’s half covered w/solid material and half window… so there are no roll up covers over total window side- and considering that is one of the materials I’m questioning the longevity of- that’s good to have less of it! 😉There is a tiny clip that goes around the top on one end- zippers can meet right at it and it’s small so not a problem but have NO idea what it’s for! (Other than frustrating me that it def takes two hands for me to get it unclipped!!🤣)In looking back at the listing it looks like it’s supposed to have a food or supply pouch that clicks on what looks like this clip so not sure if that’s just missing or if I’m missing what this is for… either way it truly isn’t a big deal- just worth mentioning so you’ll know!Biggest difference is the connection and piece that has the retractable handle and the wheels. Mine came with 4 wheels in a baggie and they connected easily enough to the four “feet” on bottom of connection piece- (not so easy to get back off but possible!😉) honestly I’m not sure what the purpose of the wheels being removable even is as you couldn’t use this with that piece connected and wheels off!! You’d be scratching and dragging those permanent protrusions across whatever flooring, etc. as the entire piece must be removed to use without wheels and handle.In the photos, I see the same handle top sticking out from the underside..?? and it has two Velcro strips that simply line up to put carrier on piece with wheels… but what I got had a piece with two flaps along edges that have one part of Velcro and you have to line it up- make sure the handle is on correct end so you can use another unexplained clip set to hold it up when pushed down- even though as you can also see in a photo it’s not held flush or tight- just kinda wobbles around. (It’s the only way I could figure out to hold the handle and handle “flap” upright!)The handle is connected to a second piece of solid board that looks pretty weird when held out as a handle… see my loud video 🤣🫣 … forget how great these speakers are and should mute TV!!Writing all this, it may seem nuts to even give it 3 stars but it does have solid zippers with three different ways to put in or get out your pet and if you have a nervous pet- you know it’s usually good if they can see you thru the windows and you can even put a hand in one of those openings safely to calm them… each zipper set clips together for even more security and there is an attached line with a clip on the end to attach (I assume😉) to your pet’s collar for a final line of safety if you have an escape artist! 👀🐾So -all in all not a total bust as it is lightweight and has the positive attributes above with decent padded strap if carried vs using wheels (depending on your pet’s wt/ this helps!!) …. but honestly, I think I’d be considering returning had I had to pay what they’re asking! Sorry… but I’d want to know!😏Fyi-for comparison sake- last carrier I got was quite a few yrs ago and is by the “Dog Whisperer” so it’s pretty nice- still! So, maybe it’s an unfair comparison!?

I'm Shocked How Good It Is!"", 'author': 'Ryan A. Leemhuis', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'A little background first. We had previously used the Crown Majestic feeder for our cat. It worked fairly well although it was a bit ugly, would occasionally jam and the portion sizes were very hit and miss. We used it until its power connection internally broke and it would only run off batteries which was difficult to keep up with.So that led me on my search for a replacement. There are a lot more options now than there used to be. My main features I was looking for were wifi control and reliability.I found it difficult to narrow down my choice as I found varying reviews and some claimed that a model was terrible and some said it was amazing. I eventually settled on the Petkit mini feeder from a cost and design perspective. First of all, it looks great. I love the thought that went into the design from the magnetically attached bowl to the jumper that allows the DC adapter to easily disconnect from the wall should you need. I was a little nervous about how much food could be stored but upon seeing the compartment this is a good amount for a cat. I find we need to fill it once every 2 weeks or so.That brings us to the worst part of the product. Lets just be clear here...the app is decent...but there are some language oddities and the setup did not go according to design. I am a techy and I initially tried pairing the feeder with my phone. It got fairly far into the setup but kept failing out during the wifi pairing process. I then tried my wife\'s phone and it did the same. I then happened to notice that the feeder was already showing on the app\'s dashboard and sure enough it had been paired even though the app claimed it had failed. I don\'t know why this occurred but be prepared for some setup issues.Once setup, however, the app is great. The food portion sizes are accurate and on demand feeds occur nearly immediately. The schedule is easy to setup and food is distributed on time. We use prescription ""disc-shaped"" food and other feeders claimed they weren\'t compatible. We have had ZERO issues with this machine getting jammed or having any issue with our food. It is actually very fun to watch the little door open on the machine and then the food dump out.For the cost, this feeder is a steal. It is so much better than our previous feeder it makes me wonder why I didn\'t upgrade earlier. My only suggestions for improvement would be to further improve the app and instructions translations. There are some real English oddities (which you can see in the product\'s amazon page as well. In addition, the setup process obviously needs some improvement too as it failed twice for me and some how magically appeared on my apps dashboard after this fail. Other than that, the feeder is perfect. It feels very high quality and the mechanics seem sound.

It looks like it belongs in an art museum.The PetKit Mini feeder is the ideal automatic feeder for my needs. What I like best is that it precisely delivers very small meals (as little as 1/20 of a cup or 5 grams) to my overweight cat up to 10 times per day. In my case I had been feeding my cat 20 grams of cat kibbles twice per day... or 40 grams. My cat was waking me up at 4 AM begging for more food. The PetKit Mini stopped the begging behavior! With the PetKit Mini I was able to schedule 8 feedings of 5 grams each... for a total of 40 grams per day... but spread out over the course of the day and night. This way my cat gets precisely fed her reduced ration and eliminates my tendency to give her a little extra when she begs.The PetKit Mini has improved my cat's relationship with me. She no longer relies on me for food. With the PetKit Mini she visits me often and regularly because she wants my company... not because she wants food. And it has improved my relationship with my cat since I am no longer irritated by her pestering behaviors at 4 AM when she gets hungry.The engineers who designed the PetKit Mini payed very close attention to critical details that separate this feeder from the pack. I studied them all before I made my purchase decision. The silicone rubber paddles that meter the kibbles into the rotary dosing cups are designed to flex so the kibbles don’t jam in the mechanism.The engineers used silicone rubber gaskets to seal out moisture at the feeding door and food reservoir lid. Then they provide a replaceable desiccant pack (those little packs that you often find in a box of new shoes) that absorb any moisture that might otherwise accumulate in your dried food. You can imagine that if your kibbles absorbed moisture from the air and swelled up like a sponge that they wouldn’t feed well in the mechanism. It also keeps the food fresher and prevents mold growth I would think.I found the PetKit Mini was easy to set up. It did help that I had an $8 electronic scale so I could better measure in grams how much I had been feeding my cat. I had been using a very small measuring cup. It was a lot easier to weigh the kibbles than to try to measure the volume of food.I measured the amount of food the PetKit Mini delivered with each feeding. I did this 8 times just to see how repeatable the feedings were. With my dry kibbles the average amount of each feeding was 4.97 grams. Pretty good if you were targeting 5 grams! (The standard deviation was 0.31 grams… who remembers what a standard deviation is???)Since I am only feeding my cat 40 grams per day the food reservoir is large enough for storing a 37 day supply. I can just check the food level once per month to be safe… but the PetKit Mini is designed with a monitor that will alert me when the food is low. What a great feature! It will also remind me every 30 days to replace the desiccant pack. I found some after-market desiccant packs on EBay that will fit the PetKit Mini because I couldn’t find any OEM packs online.This is a great automatic WiFI cat feeder! I liked it so much I bought a second PetKit Mini for my daughter for Christmas. She too has an overweight cat (though not for long).

Unboxing and putting everything together is easy, and so far the feeder has been reliable. That said, I think the app is a lot more complex than it needs to be, and while that can be updated and changed over time, it's important to know what you're getting into.When you go through setup of the feeder and app for the first time, I think the experience is a bit all over the place. There are instruction stickers on the feeder itself, there is a booklet of instructions, there are QR codes and links within the booklet to scan to get to videos that you have to watch for further steps, and then there's setup within the app itself... etc. I think it's just a few too many layers of info and could be pared down significantly. Once everything is setup and you're trying to actually use the app, those same issues of unnecessary layers/ complications continue. The app tries to get you to schedule meals based on feeding recommendations for your pet, so you have to setup a profile for each of your pets first. This sounds minor, but it's quite detailed, and includes a whole lot of information that isn't truly necessary just to make a recommendation for feeding quantity. In the end, a truly informed recommendation would really require nutrition information about your pet food itself, so the whole exercise is a bit silly. I was left feeling a bit unsure of how much of this information I *really* needed or wanted to complete. Once you have been asked about various details for your pet, then you need to schedule fixed meals for each, and again I do appreciate that they tried to include a lot of options for customization, but it's just too much. For one, how do they propose that you make sure the right pet eats the right meal, etc? I think it would be much easier to remove those options, or hide them behind an advanced mode, and just let you set a very simple schedule with set times and quantities. K.I.S.S. you know? Given that the app doesn't interface with bluetooth trackers or smart catboxes or anything like that, I'm not sure I see any need for the pet profiles at all! It just adds complexity for no discernible reason.Beyond the actual cumbersome data entry requirements, I found the interface to be not very intuitive. I had difficulty finding the settings that I actually wanted to look for and find out more about, such as the Alexa integration, and kept getting lost in layers of social media integrations and gamification... which, why? I was looking into trying out the Smart Home integration options, but do I need a community and messaging platform for my smart feeder? Maybe this is more of a cultural thing, I believe the company is based in China, but I just don't need this kind of fluff cluttering up the basic functions of the app. I'd really enjoy it more if they could pull back on these added features, or again, maybe just hide them all in one area of the app called 'Social' or similar, but they seemed to be behind every corner. For me, again it just took away from the experience of feeling like I could find the basic information and functions quickly and easily. Thankfully, apps can be can be improved and refined over time, so I feel that most of those concerns are somewhat secondary. If you plan to use it in a way where you can sit down and get through it, then basically 'set it and forget it', I think it will work well for you. But if you would plan to regularly make any tweaks to your meal plans, I think it would be a not-minor annoyance. I'll also mention that this is something my partner and I considered setting up for aging parents, just as a little convenience item to make their lives easier. After working with it, I don't know if I can comfortably go that direction. I definitely don't feel confident that they would have gotten through any of the initial setup themselves, but I also don't think they could make any on-the-fly changes to the configuration even if the initial steps were done for them. My advice to the developers would be: pare down to the basics and make sure they are quick and intuitive. THEN add extras, but remember they are extras and not your primary functions.Ok, so it seems like I'm coming down kind of harsh. All that said, I do think this product will work just fine for use in my own home. The feeder itself is sturdy and has so far been reliable. While I don't have direct experience with a lot of competing products, I had been taking note of some other design issues I'd noted in some of those competitors and waited to try something that seemed to address them. For one, I don't just appreciate the option for plug-in power and battery backup, for me that's an absolute requirement on something like this. The food storage compartment also seems secure, which was a concern I had because I have one cat that will get into ANYTHING edible that is left out. I'm impressed because he hasn't even tried with this, which also tells me the seals are probably decent and he's not being tempted by the smell of kibble. That also leads me to believe that bugs shouldn't be an issue, though time will tell. I also appreciate that the actual food bowl portion is easily removable, as it just snaps into place with a magnet. Being plastic based, it's important to clean something like that regularly and you and I both know that won't happen if it's a pain point. Ideally, I would really like to see this component and the food storage bin being made out of stainless steel, but maybe that's something that could be incorporated in a future revision as well.Let's wrap this up...On the whole, if you are patient and technologically competent enough to get through the configuration of the app itself, it's a good product that I think you'll be happy with."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 12, 2020', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '1.0 out of 5 stars The PetKit app is nearly useless for this feeder!

Unfortunately, Petkit and Amazon failed to disclose that the app isn't ready for the hardware. I consider this failure to be a bait and switch scam and I'd return it but I already tossed the package because the delivery person left it in the rain without a plastic wrap for protection.Linking the app and feeder was easy.

So far so good.Next task is to program my two cats into the Feeding Calculator. Entering the name is easy. Enter the weight? The app reverts to a default weight of 6.8 pounds every time. So it fails to update the cats's weights. FAIL! There isn't any obvious way to edit the cat information either. So another FAIL! Interesting is that I have the PetKit Puramax automatic litter box with my cats' weights entered correctly. The feeder links to the info but changes the weights without any input from me. Another FAIL?Next it asks me to enter their cat food. I feed Purina Indoor Cat Food, a very common dry cat food pellet available in any American grocery store. Instead of a simple-to-use barcode reader that searches online and enters the food analysis for me, I have to enter the analysis manually. Okay, needlessly complicated but okay.The app lets me program the feeding schedule but I'm unable to vary the portion size. I ran a few trials and the portion size isn't consistent.

It's a stockier feeder so it's hard to knock over. It's feed buttons are on the side and requires you to hold them to dispense food manually. Also the cat can't reach a impeller to vend food. It even has a dessicant (oxygen absorber) you can add to keep food fresh in the feeder. I ended up buying some replacements that you can heat up to reuse as a cost saving measure. This pet kit feeder includes a HD camera and a speaker and microphone if you want to talk to your cats or set recorded messages during feeding times. You can set detailed feeding times and has an easy way to stop a feeding in case you want to feed them wet food. The app can be somewhat buggy at times but never for more than a minute since it fixes itself. It will bother you about signing up for the petkit+ service to see video recordings and make vlogs to music of their activities in front of the camera.

A newer model and differences.', 'author': 'Nicholas Ortega', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""Unboxing this, I was at first unimpressed as I pulled the detached shell which felt flimsy and cheap. The knobs for the fan and LED device were very much plastic, despite looking metallic. But worst of all, the vents on the shell are made of a very cheap plastic that flexes under slight pressure. But once attached to the rest of the backpack, the whole thing felt much sturdier.The quality of the backpack half itself is quite good and very comfortable. I spent a few hours at the park the next day with it on and it was by far the most comfortable cat backpack I've worn. It felt quite sturdy with the weight of my pet inside of it. Most importantly, like other models I've used, it didn't flex upon wearing, giving my pet maximum room to move around. It is quite space and my cat is sort of big. I'm very happy with the window tinting and the ventilation seems to hold up. I'm even more happy only the top 70 percent of the shell is exposed by the plastic glass, giving my pet a sense of security when in need of a hiding place.THE FAN: This is the most important part. I can tell it started out as a gimmick, upon seeing other review pictures, the basic design and airflow of the fan seemed incredibly flawed. I can tell this was the main focus for improvement in this bag. The fan is much slimmer and without a vent for direct contact. I can certainly feel the airflow which is somewhat satisfactory for the size. It is certainly audibly quiet and I can feel the breeze easily from 6 inches away, More so if I stick my head in the far opposite corner. The LED is quite bright. I'm happy with this feature.POWER. No battery is included. You must have your own portable USB portable battery. When using the fan on full speed for 3 straight hours, my 10350 MHZ battery pack didn't budge from having 4 power indicators on out of 4.COLOR: There is only ONE color. The blue and pink is pretty nice with the grey back half, it vertainly doesn't make me feel anymore masculine but it's nice. I really wish they had more color options.Make sure you choose the BREEZY DOME 2 in pink/blue for the newest model and I'm sure greater satisfaction. I'm pretty happy with it for the price of 70 USD.I noticed NOBODY had a review of the newer model so I'm going to be that good Samaritan.QUALITY: 4.1/5COMFORT: 4.5/5VALUE: 4.5/5"", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 25, 2022', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars I absolutely love this bag!!', 'author': 'Kelvin M.', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'The media could not be loaded. After doing research on cat backpacks, I finally bit the bullet and decided to purchase this Petkit bag. Needless to say that I am thoroughly impressed by the design and quality of this bag. My cat absolutely loved it as well and I have taken him on three walks since I unboxed it.-The quality of this bag is really impressive for the price. The front of the bag is a very sturdy plastic material and has enough ventilation for Pluto (my cat) to not feel like he is suffocating. The window is tinted and I’m sure that it will come in handy during the summer when the sun is extremely bright.-The back of the backpack is padded, and the straps as well. It’s super comfortable and I didn’t feel any tension on my back/shoulders. The back of the backpack doesn’t cave in, which is great because it optimizes the space for my cat. The bottom of the bag also holds his weight.-The net area is more of a rubber material so you wont need to worry about your cat scratching out of the bag if they do not like it.-The fan and light is really cool and makes this backpack more high-tech than other ones. The light isn’t blinding and the fan is perfect enough to make sure the bag enough is properly ventilated. It powers through USB.I am very happy with this purchase and the quality definitely justifies the price. I work from home so going on walks is important for me, and this bag is now allowing me to take Pluto with me.

But the most important part is that it's so durable that there's absolutely no way they can rip a whole through anything and escape. Other bags have a fabric mesh. But in this bag the mesh is made of a thicker plastic material so it's impossible to claw through. And the whole thing is pretty big.

As soon as we bring it out of the closet, she turns into a crotchety old lady, kind of like Jekyll and Hyde, but made entirely out of whiskers and lint. She doesn’t hesitate to let us know how she feels about it either, because she howls incessantly the ENTIRE TIME she’s in there, to the point that she “loses her voice” and her meow and purr are squeaky for day or so afterwards. Since she’s been a robustly healthy girl, the carrier situation wasn’t a huge problem, as she only needed to go to the vet for well visits. Unfortunately, as she entered her sunset years, she has taken up the mantle from the late Wilford Brimley and was recently diagnosed with the diabeetus. Her trips to the vet will be more frequent while we figure out to manage her diabetes with prescription food and insulin shots. Because I am a little extra and I love my cat, I decided that she should travel happy, and in style! She is an indoor cat, but she absolutely loves going outside with a harness and leash, which is how we know it’s the carrier itself that she hates. So as soon as her spaceship arrived, I unpacked it and left it out for a few days with the back open for her to get used to it. Today, I put her harness on (which she happily steps into because she knows it means we are going on an outside adventure!) and put her in the spaceship for a short walk outside. Not only did she *not* hate it (as evidenced by the absence of her singing the song of her people for all to hear) she actually seemed quite cozy and was purring! I gave her a treat as soon as I unzipped it to let her out and she is still my friend so I am calling this backpack a success! I haven’t tried the light or the fan yet because she was only in it very briefly. Also worth noting, is that Kimmy is quite small, weighing in at a whopping 9 pounds 3 ounces as of her last trip to the vet, so I can’t say for sure, but I HIGHLY doubt any of my other 3 cats - who happen to be fat, murder mitt wielding freeloaders - would fit in it. Overall, this backpack is reasonably priced, looks adorable, and Kimmy Katdashian definitely prefers it to her cat carrier, so I think this was a good purchase all around.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States April 26, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '3.0 out of 5 stars You have to buy a separate power source!', 'author': 'Living_Lime_Green', 'rating': 3, 'content': 'The backpack I received has clearly been used though it was sold as a new product. There are four ways I know the bag is not new. 1) The clear protective cover on the ‘window’ was simply Saran Wrap and didn’t even cover the entire window; 2) There are no tags or stickers on the bag that would indicate a new product; 3) One of the external ventilation plates has a mark that is not something that would come from shipping or storing- it’s similar to a rust spot; 4) There was dried organic ‘debris’ on the floor pad (definitely food or post-digestion material).The bag itself is fine. The zipper is awful (it’s plastic and I don’t see it lasting long) and there really should be a second set of zippers so that the bag can be zipped from both sides. I suspect that I’ll want/need to take the bag in to have a better zipper installed. You have to have a separate power source for the light/fan to work and I was not aware of that, so it’s disappointing (my fault- should have read the description better). You cannot charge the fan/light.So far, my assessment is that this bag is not worth the price paid. I paid $60 in a lightening deal and I believe the retail is $100. With no power source, I think $20 needs to be knocked off the price. Since I received a used bag, I also feel like I overpaid.**This is the third cat backpack I’ve ordered and received from Amazon in the past week. The first one was sold as new but was clearly a used bag, and it was not the product that was advertised/ordered. The first bag had no outer protective bag, no window covering film, no tags or stickers, no instructions. The second bag (replacement for the first) was identical to the first -still the wrong model, not what I ordered. The second bag had a protective film on the window, and a generic UPC code sticker on the outer plastic bag, so I’m not 100% certain it was used (sold as new), but it sure didn’t feel/look new. No instructions or tags. I decided to go with another bag and seller with this third backpack. Imagine my surprise when this one appears to be used as well.

First off, it's airline-approved, at least for Alaska Airlines in-cabin, on economy. I was worried this wouldn't fit underneath the seat, because Southwest (another reviewer) had larger under-seat margins. But this backpack fit snugly under the seat in front of me. It will slide about halfway underneath the window-side seat. It will NOT fit fully underneath the middle row seat, so you'll need to take note of that when booking your flights / seat assignment. Airport check-in and customs was fine as well - you can ask for a 'private screening room' if you don't want to take your pet out of the carrier.Now onto the fan and light functions: It's just beautiful.Some buyers don't read the short manual it comes with and then complain that the 'fan and light didn't work.' It explicitly states, in the manual (and I'm pretty sure on the box), that the fan and the light requires an external power bank / battery pack to run. That's it. Simply unzip the side pocket and plug your power bank to the USB cable (built into the backpack). The fan automatically turns on for your pet.My power bank is 4 x 3 inches (10cm x 8cm), but the pocket is big enough to house a power bank of 6 inches (15cm) in height. I thought the features sounded too good to be true online, but they're real! Changing the fan setting from 'Auto' is touch-screen enabled, and turning the light on/ off is just a press and hold. The fan power isn't the strongest, so I wouldn't advise relying on it too much. But it does provide a little extra breeze for kitty. And the light works well too.I think the backpack attracted just as much attention as the kitty. Several people commented on it and never seen such a 'high tech' backpack before.

The side panels do not make it easy for me to stick my hand in to check on him or comfort him. The side panels are structural, so I can’t unzip it just a little and stick my hand in. I have to unzip it all the way and open the side panel like a door, which causes the top of the bag to collapse on that side and also does not keep the puppy contained if I have to open the door.

All of the mesh on the case is thick so your pet can't scratch it's way out. The base is a PP board. It covered with a pad that is reversible. One side is plush and fluffy for comfort. I am not sure what the other side is made of but it is a soft weaved fabric that is supposed to be cooling and breathable. It unzips easily for machine washing.This carrier is really nice and practical. I think that it is a well thought out product. The only thing that I wasn't fully happy with was that if you have one of the sides unzipped, the top droops a tiny bit on one side. However, it is completely sturdy when both sides are zipped.

Happy with purchase', 'author': 'Dblmms', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'This crate works very well for my needs - I wanted something for my cat for traveling with enough space for a small litter box. He took to the crate right away when I set it up in the house for him to become familiar with it. He is older and suddenly suffered severe vision impairment so I wanted something where he could feel and be reasonably secure if around other animals in other homes etc. This serves this purpose well - unless the other animal would behave more aggressively or in an overly enthusiastic way. Since the ""windows"" are not as large on 3 sides - I feel this gives him more security and protection without needing to cover the crate with a towel or blanket. The ""window"" on the top is nice to allow in more light. if I was in an environment where I felt there was an aggressive animal or human need more protection when I would not be around, however, I would opt for a hard sided carrier personally - but this offers protection in most circumstances.This soft crate seems to be well-made from what I can tell so far. It is very easy to set up and take down - and easy to carry - much lighter in weight than a hard sided carrier and can be folded to be more compact for storage. I bought the beige color and it is a very nice neutral color - fairly light in color but not so light that it will show every single speck of dirt. I believe I bought the largest size available (32"") - I wish there were just one size larger with the little extra room for the litter box - it seems a little cramped in there for any extended use needs - but in general it has worked out quite well - and small size does take up less room in the car. I have a Honda CRV and I managed to fit it into the passenger seat area though it was very cramped - in a larger vehicle it would fit into the passenger seat area fairly easily, I imagine.Of course, for typical type of use with a dog or cat, you simply choose the best size which fits them. I am sure the smallest size would be quite ideal/adequate for most cats or small dogs.The carrying handles and straps are also very handy - I have only owned this for about a month, so I cannot attest to long term durability - but I think it should hold us well for quite some time with average use. I am not sure how any of the soft sided crates which are available (any brand) will hold up if an animal is aggressive or determined/persistent in trying to ""break out"" of the crate - if you think you have an animal which would do that, a hard sided carrier might be a more reliably durable choice in that circumstance perhaps.I highly recommend this crate!', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 8, 2016', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect carrier!', 'author': 'LindsayDD', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I was in desperate need of a new cat carrier. The one I've had for years was a mess. It was one of the plastic ones and had a plastic door as well. I unfortunately had to pull it out of my closet where I store it for 3 different emergencies. The first time I had just seconds to get it out, find my cat, get him in it and get out of the building. The second & third times I needed it, I had a minute or so to get it out (might still sound bad, but better than seconds!) and get my cat in it. Unfortunately when I would pull it out the doors hinges would pop out. Not good in an emergency! I figured I'd try a soft carrier with zippers rather than a solid plastic one with a door. With all the issues at my complex, I'm sure I would end up needing it again, but that's a whole other story!I was looking through all the carriers for hours. I finally found this one. Not many carriers come in different sizes, but this one has plenty of options. It came packaged very nicely and slid right out of the box. It has 2 poles on either side of the interior of the carrier. The one end slides back and the other end slides in to it. It's very easy to put together and fold down as well. It has sturdy handle straps which can be placed together. The 2 openings (top and front) unzip and can be rolled up and attached to velcro which is on both sides for when it's open or closed. I love how it folds flat for easy storage (although Milo decided to make it his new house) and has clips to hold it together. It also has a handle and detachable shoulder strap for carrying it when folded down. The removable fleece pad is nice, but could be a little thicker. Although I've seen several mats sold separately that I'm sure would fit, but if you aren't using it often it will be just fine with the one included. I figured I'd leave it out for a while so he gets his scent on it and gets used to it. Turns out it will be staying out since he now loves sleeping in it! He's tried to get on the top so I had to keep it open. I don't know if it would be able to support his weight on the netting. Overall it's a great carrier (house) for Milo who is 15lbs.

The included bed is a bit thin (we put a more plush bed on top), but given the low price it's a nice extra. The crate is light weight and easy to carry, and collapses down for compact storage. The materials feel durable. The frame is strong, it doesn't flex when I pick up the crate with my dog inside, and he seems very comfortable.I wouldn't recommend this crate if you think your dog will scratch at the doors/windows and try to escape, as their claws might rip the mesh window material eventually. That's not the fault of the product though, get a hard sided case if you have an escape artist in the house!There is a door on the top as well, which is great for easily picking up your pet when you want to keep the front closed to prevent them from scurrying away. The front opening is plenty large enough for easy entering/exiting.Cons:Removed one star because the shoulder strap is just for carrying the crate when it is collapsed, not when you're pet is in the crate. It would be nice if you could use the shoulder strap to carry it with your pet, but it does have hand held handles for carrying, so it's not a deal-breaker.It's a bit difficult to pull the mechanism that separates the frame when you are assembling/disassembling. It doesn't feel as though it will break but it can be stiff.

I'm fairly strong but no matter how much I pushed back on the bars, they overlapped (see picture).

Instead of disposing of it, the company then sent it to me.

The first thing I noticed is that there are four different sizes, and not all colors come in all sizes. Here are the four criteria:Pet size/weight- weights listed are 10, 12, 13.5 and 17 pounds, and there aren’t as many in the heavier sizes to choose from if you have cats that are chonks like some of mine.Strap types- adjustable and non-adjustableClosure types- none; snaps (erroneously labeled “buttons”); (actual) buttons and loops; zippers.Animal types- some are listed as being for small dogs, though at least one of the demonstration pictures will show someone carrying a cat in the same one, (go figure); some are rated for both. I’m not sure what the difference is, but I narrowed it down to those which had cats listed as I have four of them.First- figure out what size you’ll need based on the weight of your pet; size for the largest one you’ll carry if you have more than one. Second- determine the other features you want such as strap and closure type, Third, only THEN look for a color you can be at least OK with. Your favorite color might not be in that size with those features though you’ll undoubtedly find something that’s acceptable.I got this carrier primarily for my blue-eyed boy who is my snuggle buddy and weighs in at a reasonable 12.5 #. He likes to be held when I’m working at home so I got this so he can get his cuddles in and I can still have my hands free. Of the three girls, two of them are chonks, one weighs just over 16# and the other is right behind her at 15#. The bigger of the two also likes the occasional cuddle so it had to be big enough to accommodate her, paring the choices down to ones rated to 17#. I also wanted an adjustable strap and snap closures so that pretty much left me with only a handful of choices; I got the noble gray.As for the carrier itself, I found it to be very light and durable. The snaps on mine seemed a bit on the weak side so I wished I had gotten the buttons and loops instead of the snaps, but unless he’s pushing against them, they'll still hold. The other thing that surprised me is it almost wasn’t deep enough to go around him. This carrier is definitely long enough for my all my kitties, but I can’t get it closed around my biggest one.The other thing to be aware of is it could take some time for your pet to get used to it. Haven’t yet succeeded with my biggest girl, though the other three have at least tolerated it for a few minutes. I’ll keep shoving them in there from time to time hoping they’ll eventually be OK with it. That to say I haven’t had a ton of experience using it just yet.

The one I have had was also collapsible. I had it for at least 12 years. The inside bottom floor was made of particle board and slipped into a vinyl sleeve. My biggest complaint with the carrier was that it was not a pee proof bottom. Particle board would get soaked and come apart. I had to cut cardboard to fit the bottom to replace it many times. Also the inside of the roof of my old carrier had a panel in it that if it slipped out of the casing would collapse on top of my cat randomly. This new carrier is awesome! The ends zip closed to assemble the entire carrier. When the ends are unzipped the whole thing will collapse flat. The back end and left side are solid flat material that is not see-through. The right side and front entrance as well as the roof entrance are heavy black mesh. There is a hand strap with a leather wrap for the handle as well as a shoulder strap. The clasps are of sturdy heavy plastic and metal. The zippers are well made and sturdy. The canvas outside seems waterproof. The very best part of the entire purchase for me is that the floor is made of plastic! A sheet of plastic with a plastic foam layer and the whole thing in a canvas and shirpa sleeve.I set the assembled carrier outside in the sun and the moment my cat stepped outside he walked right into it and lay down. He is about 8 lb and a small mini Maine coon. The medium size was very roomy and he seemed to be very comfortable. I especially like the closed off left side and back. Having the carrier open all the way around would offer great ventilation but no privacy or security. I only wish there was a way to make the top of it closed to protect from wind or rain. Having the top completely open all the time seems like it is begging for a more versatile option however draping a towel or blanket over the top is probably fine.

Plastic, not canvas (for those who rely on pics and rating).', 'author': 'Angry Bird', 'rating': 4, 'content': '6/19/19I’ll say right away that I did not spend enough time reading the reviews or the product details. I looked at the 4.8 average from of the 200+ reviews and thought it couldn’t be less than awesome. I was so surprised to be hit right in the face by an extremely strong chemical smell once I took these carriers out of the packages. My curious cat, even though she typically jumps inside of EVERYTHING to explore it, did not come closer than a couple of inches and squinted a lot as she sniffed the thing. She immediately got out and looked annoyed when I put her in through the top window. The other cat, who is more cautious, never let me put him inside of his, but he is really hard to coax into going into anything (excluding boxes).I did not expect the carriers to be made almost entirely of plastic; from the pictures and the reviews rating, I surmised it was going to be canvas. I washed the carriers and the pads (after removing the hard inside parts) with soap and LOTS of water; they’re drying now. Will see if the smell goes away partially or completely and update. Will also see if I have any issues such as other customers describe (the carrier breaking during transportation, or the cat opening the zipper - that’s just insane; I can’t believe anyone would rate it above three stars after an experience like that).Overall, I feel like I was mislead by the extremely high rating and would exchange these for a different model right away if it weren’t for the fact that I have to move my furry beasts to our new apartment the day after tomorrow, and I don’t want to risk not having carriers for them. Since my cats have grown out of their first soft carriers, I’ve been getting by with a gifted hard shell, and it was enough because I rarely have to carry both cats at the same time. However, they get VERY anxious inside it, and tend to hurt themselves when they’re putting their faces to the air holes because the edges are hard.I was really counting on these to be good. The smell was the first bad surprise, and then the alarming stories in the reviews. I will either bump the rating to four stars if they hold up for the move, or downgrade it to two if any horror story happens with me and mine. So far, this gets a star off for the smell, and a star off to help other customers avoid forgoing research simply due to this item’s high rating. To be fair, however, I’ve noticed that the construction is fairly precise, with all parts fitting together nicely. The zippers, given that you make sure to roll them to the right side over the rib and handle them carefully, seem very sturdy; the carriers keep their shape well if the bottom is inserted snugly (which I also appreciated because our old ones tended to fumble around all the time).Update 7/2/19We’ve moved and the carriers have survived it. There are slight changes in shape with the top, but the carriers are still usable. I can smell them as much as I’d expect to smell this kind of plastic, so the initial strong smell is gone after the wash but there’s definitely residual smell. I had the cats sedated during the move, and we did not have any escape stories, whether due to their good drugs or due to the carriers’ construction. I’m bumping the rating to 4 for now. Will let you know if anything changes with use.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States June 20, 2019', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Seems sturdy and easy to store', 'author': 'Breanne B.', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""This carrier arrived today, I haven't been able to use it yet since I bought it to go pick up my kittens next month, but on inspection it seems like quite a well built carrier!

I was delighted to see that there is two support beams along the top, one on each side, which has me optimistic it won't smoosh the kitty while carrying. The 'leather' handle is a little flimsy and hard to snap the second button. There is a zipper for the small screens on the ends, and another zipper that will open the whole end to be collapsed down. The screens that open also have two zippers so that you can zip from both directions. The bottom layer has a sherpa sleeve, with a foam pad and hard plastic corrugated plate inside; which unzips nicely for you to be able to toss in the washer, I assume. With both ends unzipped the whole carrier collapses easily and can be folded up for easy convenient storage.

To give you some context, I have an active 78 pound border collie greyhound mix who gets 3 cups of a good quality dog food (1 cup 3 times a day) plus a dental chew, so he leaves 3 to 4 deposits a day. One of these bags can easily hold two of his deposits (good quality food means less input which means less output) and still have plenty of room leftover to tie off the top. Of course, your mileage may vary.I don’t use a dispenser. Instead I pre separate the bags so I can just grab one or two as I’m heading out the door. I do it this way because 1) I feel it works better to use two hands holding onto each side of the perforation when separating (I’ve lost some hand strength and it’s a lot easier with both hands, plus I haven’t had a single one of these bags tear in the wrong place doing it that way), 2) I live in Minnesota, and gloves and/or cold weather in the winter can make it more challenging to separate the bags while outside, and 3) my hands are pretty full with leash, ball, and dog, and it’s a lot simpler to just pull a pre separated bag out of my pocket (I usually pre open them, too).Even when picking up from fresh snow, when it’s not possible to completely avoid picking up some of the snow as well, I haven’t had any trouble with leakage.

But, before I get into the details, let me just say that I saw this product or very similar products available from multiple sellers. I went with the lower priced item, which can sometimes be disastrous - proving the old addage ""You get what you pay for."" In this case, however, the item appears to be of very good quality and not at all cheaply made.As if there were even that many things to consider with what seems to be as simple a product as a doggy poo bag holder, the designers of this product have thought of every minute detail that would make a doggy poo bag holder the ultimate item of convenience and safety. The holder itself seems durable and appears easy to fill with a screw off bottom. Then, there is the included carabiner that has an upgrade beyond the standard cheap carabiner with its added twist-to-lock mechanism that will keep the holder attached to the leash even when jostled or thrown about during storage of the leash or leaps of excited puppies (preventing the carabiner from opening unintentionally and slipping off the leash).The bags themselves are a pleasant, gender-neutral color with cute animal images on them and are lightly scented to counteract the offensive nature of their contents on the olfactory system of its bearer. It does appear the item will also take most standard poo bag rolls once this nice roll is used up.Then, there\'s the LED light, which in and of itself is a fabulous feature. It may add a bit of heft to the item, but from someone who watched in horror (about the speak a warning) as her husband dropped his smart-phone-turned-flashlight into a steaming pile of fresh dog poo on a night walk, it is a great feature to have the built-in LED light. It\'ll be super handy for finding the elusive night-walk poo, and also for added safety on night walks, increasing vehicles\' ability to spot human & pup walking at night in a neighborhood without sidewalks. Not only did the product designers think to include a built in light with a nice, bright yellow on/off button, but the manufacturers decided to ship the product with batteries already installed and a pull-tab piece of plastic preventing the batteries from being drained during shipping. And, as if that were not impressive enough, the company went above and beyond by also shipping the product complete with a package of 6 replacement batteries included at no extra cost.In addition to the convenience of already having extra button-cell batteries, which many don\'t keep stocked in their household since they are less frequently used than AA or AAA batteries, they added a bright-colored reflective velcro strap that attaches the dangling baggy holder, which is longer than many similar products due to the inclusion of the light, to a lower area of the leash, steadying it and keeping it from swinging awkwardly during a brisk walk or jog. I\'ve never seen a feature like this before - never even thought about it. In fact, the feature was so unexpected, I had to return to the product page to see what the included velcro strap was actually for. I\'m still not convinced I\'ve attached everything correctly, as I had an extra, wider piece of velcro strap, which I just looped onto another part of the leash for added reflectivity at night.And, if all that is not enough, it came with a never-before-seen used-poo-bag holder as well. I have yet to use it, but I can definitely see its usefulness, especially if walking more than one dog at a time or walking a dog while supervising children and in need of ones hands or if jogging/running with pup and thus moving arms in accordance with such exercise. I\'m fascinated by the ingenuity behind the hollow key-like outline shape that can attach to the leash handle, poo holder, your own wrist, or a belt loop using the provided soft-but-durable elastic strap in order to hold the full / used poo bag and free up the dog walker\'s hand. It can be so awkward, smelly, and downright unpleasant to walk around carrying a bag of canine feces... We\'ve all had those days where our wonderful pup decides to do his or her business two doors down and less than a quarter of the way through our intended walk and we\'re forced with the choice of turning back to dispose of the bag or carry the stinky bag of poo for the remainder of the walk. With this innovative tool, you can attach the bag of poo to the leash handle or the poo bag holder, keeping your hand free to itch your nose without gagging and preserve your dignity for the duration of your walk! Just beware, it also might appear to your pup as a fun item to chew and may be destroyed in seconds, so make sure to keep it out of pup\'s reach.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 17, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great item and customer service', 'author': 'Richard Niwinski Jr.', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I loved the idea of having a flashlight on the end of the Dog Poop Bag Dispenser.

That might not be great if your pet is inside and you're hand-carrying. But it's fine if you're using it as a backpack, plus that placement allows the mesh panel on top to be larger.

These new carriers could easily be tucked into a corner or in the back of the closet until they are needed.For now, I’ve got the unit set up and left in the kitchen floor to get the cats accustomed to it. My two cats are both just above 10 pounds and fit in this carrier very nicely. They are able to sit completely upright and have a panoramic view. There are windows on this thing upper and lower on the ‘front’ and upper halves of both sides. All of those ‘windows’ also zip open for entry and exit. No windows on the ‘back’ that’s where the backpack straps are.The front screens can be rolled up and secured on the top part, but the bottom doesn’t have Velcro that faces the right direction. I’ll probably stitch some in so all of it opens, or not. It sounds like work.I think I’ll do better with this backpack design than with carrying the hard plastic cat totes I’ve had in the past. It’s well set up as a wearable, but less well equipped to simply carry. There aren’t enough handles to distribute the weight evenly and holding onto the loop at the top back of the unit it will dump the cat at an angle toward the screen wall.But, that’s the only drawback I saw.

In my mind, a shoulder strap is like a strap that goes over one shoulder, like a purse or tote bag. I tried to see if the backpack had hardware for a shoulder strap in the photos and couldn\'t tell that it did, but figured I would see in person.

Enter this bag.The bag itself seems to be sturdy, however, the bottom is held on by a zipper that runs the circumference of the bag.I should also note, that there is no way that a potty pad can sit at the bottom of the bag. I was a bit skeptical about the zipper, but after a couple uses, I started to feel more comfortable. I also love that the bag has two clips to attach your dog's harness/collar, depending on which side they would prefer to stick their head out.The only drawback that I would note that it may not be easy to clean. If your dog tends to potty in the bag, this is not for you! If you also have a dog larger than 10 lbs., I also may not recommend this bag, as the zipper seems to be almost be at it's limit even with my little 6 lb. dog.Even with the drawbacks, we love the bag.

Obviously the 70 pound dog wouldn’t fit but I included that because she’s in the background of one of the pictures. The puppy was too long and too tall for this carrier. To give a reference the puppy is a French bulldog and Boston terrier mix that’s 10 months old and wears medium sized dog clothes. This carrier would have fit him up until around 6 months old. I set him in it and the sides were sturdy enough for him to stand on without them collapsing in on him.The cat fit in the bag and let me shove him down enough to zip it up. In the picture he’s sitting on his back legs with his front paws not touching the ground.I got this carrier to use with the cat and a pet bunny that is not in any of the pictures. The bunny will fit in this no problem and this will work great for taking the cat to the vet. I would not put either of them in this for a long road trip but both would be comfortable for a few hours.The material it is made out of is sturdy and will hold up to the bunnies teeth and the cats nails. The stitching all the way around was sound and the edging was done with weight bearing in mind. I gave it a thorough check and carried the cat around in it for a few minutes to check the stitching on the handles and it held him no problem. It folds up ok but that’s definitely one feature that could use an upgrade. It’s made out of three separate pieces ~handle, bag and bag bottom insert. You have to remove the bag insert and handle to get it to fold up small but there is no way to secure all the pieces together. The bag has a removable bottom insert for washing and stability which is a nice feature but it’s filled with a piece of foam and extra thick cardboard which will disintegrate if it gets wet. It’s waterproof on the side that velcros to the bottom but not the side your animal sits on thus moisture would ruin the its stability.Overall the bag is made out of good quality material and seems structurally sound. I would avoid using this with a pet prone to accidents or with a water bowl in it.

The soft carrier is hard to wash, so after the most recent incident (a vet visit), it occurred to me that a hard carrier would be much easier to clean. With this in mind I started a pretty comprehensive search and found that while the PetMate carriers seem to get the best reviews for build quality, there were none that were the right size for a 13lb adiult cat. Their smallest is tiny, and the next one up seems too big to carry. I ideally wanted a 2 door carrier, and a one that would work in the car, but could also be carried the few block to our vet. Somehow I came across this Amazon carrier and I have to say it's perfect. I love that the two halves screw together so there is no chance of separation, it is exactly the right size, and the top and front gates seem to work well. To help with the wetting issue I just put a couple of disposable puppy pad in the bottom, but oddly enough our cat seemed less stressed in this carrier on the last vet trip and did not wet. If he had, it would have been a super easy cleanup with the disposable puppy pads and hard case. The only negative to this carrier would be that the handle could be a little more sturdy feeling and bigger/more comfortable. It feels like it could fail even though it was ok going to and from the vet recently. The plastic is solid enough, though with a medium weight cat the top will flex a bit when lifting.

The door opens from either side, and there are six screws to be put in - that’s it. The smaller one had nine and a door that opened only on one side or the other, depending how you wanted it before threading those nine screws. Make sure to get the screw through the bottom in the right position because the plastic is formed to the screw head, not round holes but six-sided.

They would rather harass me for my glass of water than drink from a dirty fountain. The other 2 cats are sloppy drinkers and use the water fountain to clean their mouths out.I end up cleaning our water fountain every week, and other water fountains took different size nylon brushes and I would do so much scrubbing that I was worried about plastic in the water. I would also use 2 or 3 fountains to try and alleviate how quickly they would dirty.This Petkit water fountain comes apart in a few seconds, I use warm water and finger scrub, change the coconut filter as directed and all four cats love it as much the day before I clean it as the day after I clean it. They all drink healthy amounts and it keeps them from having expensive vet visits.Plus it\'s powered by an induction plate so I don\'t even have to unplug it to safely fill it or clean it.

It worked fairly well although it was a bit ugly, would occasionally jam and the portion sizes were very hit and miss. We used it until its power connection internally broke and it would only run off batteries which was difficult to keep up with.So that led me on my search for a replacement. There are a lot more options now than there used to be. My main features I was looking for were wifi control and reliability.I found it difficult to narrow down my choice as I found varying reviews and some claimed that a model was terrible and some said it was amazing. I eventually settled on the Petkit mini feeder from a cost and design perspective. First of all, it looks great. I love the thought that went into the design from the magnetically attached bowl to the jumper that allows the DC adapter to easily disconnect from the wall should you need. I was a little nervous about how much food could be stored but upon seeing the compartment this is a good amount for a cat. I find we need to fill it once every 2 weeks or so.That brings us to the worst part of the product. Lets just be clear here...the app is decent...but there are some language oddities and the setup did not go according to design. I am a techy and I initially tried pairing the feeder with my phone. It got fairly far into the setup but kept failing out during the wifi pairing process. I then tried my wife\'s phone and it did the same. I then happened to notice that the feeder was already showing on the app\'s dashboard and sure enough it had been paired even though the app claimed it had failed. I don\'t know why this occurred but be prepared for some setup issues.Once setup, however, the app is great. The food portion sizes are accurate and on demand feeds occur nearly immediately. The schedule is easy to setup and food is distributed on time. We use prescription ""disc-shaped"" food and other feeders claimed they weren\'t compatible. We have had ZERO issues with this machine getting jammed or having any issue with our food. It is actually very fun to watch the little door open on the machine and then the food dump out.For the cost, this feeder is a steal. It is so much better than our previous feeder it makes me wonder why I didn\'t upgrade earlier. My only suggestions for improvement would be to further improve the app and instructions translations. There are some real English oddities (which you can see in the product\'s amazon page as well. In addition, the setup process obviously needs some improvement too as it failed twice for me and some how magically appeared on my apps dashboard after this fail. Other than that, the feeder is perfect. It feels very high quality and the mechanics seem sound. HIGHLY recommended.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 29, 2019', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars PetKit Mini - Small Pet Feeder - Review', 'author': 'AirplaneCatBlue', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""The PetKit Mini feeder is attractively and elegantly designed. It looks like it belongs in an art museum.The PetKit Mini feeder is the ideal automatic feeder for my needs. What I like best is that it precisely delivers very small meals (as little as 1/20 of a cup or 5 grams) to my overweight cat up to 10 times per day. In my case I had been feeding my cat 20 grams of cat kibbles twice per day... or 40 grams. My cat was waking me up at 4 AM begging for more food. The PetKit Mini stopped the begging behavior! With the PetKit Mini I was able to schedule 8 feedings of 5 grams each... for a total of 40 grams per day... but spread out over the course of the day and night. This way my cat gets precisely fed her reduced ration and eliminates my tendency to give her a little extra when she begs.The PetKit Mini has improved my cat's relationship with me. She no longer relies on me for food. With the PetKit Mini she visits me often and regularly because she wants my company... not because she wants food. And it has improved my relationship with my cat since I am no longer irritated by her pestering behaviors at 4 AM when she gets hungry.The engineers who designed the PetKit Mini payed very close attention to critical details that separate this feeder from the pack. I studied them all before I made my purchase decision. The silicone rubber paddles that meter the kibbles into the rotary dosing cups are designed to flex so the kibbles don’t jam in the mechanism.The engineers used silicone rubber gaskets to seal out moisture at the feeding door and food reservoir lid. Then they provide a replaceable desiccant pack (those little packs that you often find in a box of new shoes) that absorb any moisture that might otherwise accumulate in your dried food. You can imagine that if your kibbles absorbed moisture from the air and swelled up like a sponge that they wouldn’t feed well in the mechanism. It also keeps the food fresher and prevents mold growth I would think.I found the PetKit Mini was easy to set up. It did help that I had an $8 electronic scale so I could better measure in grams how much I had been feeding my cat. I had been using a very small measuring cup. It was a lot easier to weigh the kibbles than to try to measure the volume of food.I measured the amount of food the PetKit Mini delivered with each feeding. I did this 8 times just to see how repeatable the feedings were. With my dry kibbles the average amount of each feeding was 4.97 grams. Pretty good if you were targeting 5 grams! (The standard deviation was 0.31 grams… who remembers what a standard deviation is???)Since I am only feeding my cat 40 grams per day the food reservoir is large enough for storing a 37 day supply. I can just check the food level once per month to be safe… but the PetKit Mini is designed with a monitor that will alert me when the food is low. What a great feature! It will also remind me every 30 days to replace the desiccant pack. I found some after-market desiccant packs on EBay that will fit the PetKit Mini because I couldn’t find any OEM packs online.This is a great automatic WiFI cat feeder! I liked it so much I bought a second PetKit Mini for my daughter for Christmas. She too has an overweight cat (though not for long).

Unboxing and putting everything together is easy, and so far the feeder has been reliable. That said, I think the app is a lot more complex than it needs to be, and while that can be updated and changed over time, it's important to know what you're getting into.When you go through setup of the feeder and app for the first time, I think the experience is a bit all over the place. There are instruction stickers on the feeder itself, there is a booklet of instructions, there are QR codes and links within the booklet to scan to get to videos that you have to watch for further steps, and then there's setup within the app itself... etc. I think it's just a few too many layers of info and could be pared down significantly. Once everything is setup and you're trying to actually use the app, those same issues of unnecessary layers/ complications continue. The app tries to get you to schedule meals based on feeding recommendations for your pet, so you have to setup a profile for each of your pets first. This sounds minor, but it's quite detailed, and includes a whole lot of information that isn't truly necessary just to make a recommendation for feeding quantity. In the end, a truly informed recommendation would really require nutrition information about your pet food itself, so the whole exercise is a bit silly. I was left feeling a bit unsure of how much of this information I *really* needed or wanted to complete. Once you have been asked about various details for your pet, then you need to schedule fixed meals for each, and again I do appreciate that they tried to include a lot of options for customization, but it's just too much. For one, how do they propose that you make sure the right pet eats the right meal, etc? I think it would be much easier to remove those options, or hide them behind an advanced mode, and just let you set a very simple schedule with set times and quantities. K.I.S.S. you know? Given that the app doesn't interface with bluetooth trackers or smart catboxes or anything like that, I'm not sure I see any need for the pet profiles at all! It just adds complexity for no discernible reason.Beyond the actual cumbersome data entry requirements, I found the interface to be not very intuitive. I had difficulty finding the settings that I actually wanted to look for and find out more about, such as the Alexa integration, and kept getting lost in layers of social media integrations and gamification... which, why? I was looking into trying out the Smart Home integration options, but do I need a community and messaging platform for my smart feeder? Maybe this is more of a cultural thing, I believe the company is based in China, but I just don't need this kind of fluff cluttering up the basic functions of the app. I'd really enjoy it more if they could pull back on these added features, or again, maybe just hide them all in one area of the app called 'Social' or similar, but they seemed to be behind every corner. For me, again it just took away from the experience of feeling like I could find the basic information and functions quickly and easily. Thankfully, apps can be can be improved and refined over time, so I feel that most of those concerns are somewhat secondary. If you plan to use it in a way where you can sit down and get through it, then basically 'set it and forget it', I think it will work well for you. But if you would plan to regularly make any tweaks to your meal plans, I think it would be a not-minor annoyance. I'll also mention that this is something my partner and I considered setting up for aging parents, just as a little convenience item to make their lives easier. After working with it, I don't know if I can comfortably go that direction. I definitely don't feel confident that they would have gotten through any of the initial setup themselves, but I also don't think they could make any on-the-fly changes to the configuration even if the initial steps were done for them. My advice to the developers would be: pare down to the basics and make sure they are quick and intuitive. THEN add extras, but remember they are extras and not your primary functions.Ok, so it seems like I'm coming down kind of harsh. All that said, I do think this product will work just fine for use in my own home. The feeder itself is sturdy and has so far been reliable. While I don't have direct experience with a lot of competing products, I had been taking note of some other design issues I'd noted in some of those competitors and waited to try something that seemed to address them. For one, I don't just appreciate the option for plug-in power and battery backup, for me that's an absolute requirement on something like this. The food storage compartment also seems secure, which was a concern I had because I have one cat that will get into ANYTHING edible that is left out. I'm impressed because he hasn't even tried with this, which also tells me the seals are probably decent and he's not being tempted by the smell of kibble. That also leads me to believe that bugs shouldn't be an issue, though time will tell. I also appreciate that the actual food bowl portion is easily removable, as it just snaps into place with a magnet. Being plastic based, it's important to clean something like that regularly and you and I both know that won't happen if it's a pain point. Ideally, I would really like to see this component and the food storage bin being made out of stainless steel, but maybe that's something that could be incorporated in a future revision as well.Let's wrap this up...On the whole, if you are patient and technologically competent enough to get through the configuration of the app itself, it's a good product that I think you'll be happy with."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 12, 2020', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '1.0 out of 5 stars The PetKit app is nearly useless for this feeder! Portion size is randomly variable....', 'author': 'D', 'rating': 1, 'content': ""The PETKIT app is poorly implemented and largely non-functional. I bought this Petkit Automatic Cat Feeder because it promised being able to identify my two cats and calculate their food requirements based on weight and metabolic needs. Using this info I wanted to program daily feedings customized for each cat. This product is another example of decent hardware with poor software implementation. Unfortunately, Petkit and Amazon failed to disclose that the app isn't ready for the hardware. I consider this failure to be a bait and switch scam and I'd return it but I already tossed the package because the delivery person left it in the rain without a plastic wrap for protection.Linking the app and feeder was easy. Connecting to my home router/wifi was easy. It even ran an automatic software upgrade so I know I have the latest, greatest app software. So far so good.Next task is to program my two cats into the Feeding Calculator. Entering the name is easy. Enter the weight? The app reverts to a default weight of 6.8 pounds every time. So it fails to update the cats's weights. FAIL! There isn't any obvious way to edit the cat information either. So another FAIL! Interesting is that I have the PetKit Puramax automatic litter box with my cats' weights entered correctly. The feeder links to the info but changes the weights without any input from me. Another FAIL?Next it asks me to enter their cat food. I feed Purina Indoor Cat Food, a very common dry cat food pellet available in any American grocery store. Instead of a simple-to-use barcode reader that searches online and enters the food analysis for me, I have to enter the analysis manually. Okay, needlessly complicated but okay.The app lets me program the feeding schedule but I'm unable to vary the portion size. I ran a few trials and the portion size isn't consistent.

I almost took off 1 star for the pain in the *** setup and user interface, bit in spite of the those annoyances, I like this feeder so much that I decided to give it the full 5. I\'m so happy that it can dispense portions in increments as small as 1/20th of a cup. I use this feeder to give my cat a small snack in between her normal meals, so that tiny portion size is greatly appreciated. It\'s so nice to be able to adjust the feeding from my phone. We used to go out to eat and hang out with friends until late at night all the time and we always worried about making our cat wait for dinner until we got home, but now (once we can finally go out again) we can just use our phone to give our cat some dinner as soon as we realize we won\'t be getting home until late.Another thing I like about this feeder is that the build quality is really nice. The food tray attaches magnetically so is easy to take off, clean, and re-attach. The food sits inside an inner basket within the feeder, so it keeps all the food crumbs contained. All the parts fit together very precisely so it feels sturdy and looks really nice.

The knobs for the fan and LED device were very much plastic, despite looking metallic. But worst of all, the vents on the shell are made of a very cheap plastic that flexes under slight pressure. But once attached to the rest of the backpack, the whole thing felt much sturdier.The quality of the backpack half itself is quite good and very comfortable. I spent a few hours at the park the next day with it on and it was by far the most comfortable cat backpack I've worn. It felt quite sturdy with the weight of my pet inside of it. Most importantly, like other models I've used, it didn't flex upon wearing, giving my pet maximum room to move around. It is quite space and my cat is sort of big. I'm very happy with the window tinting and the ventilation seems to hold up. I'm even more happy only the top 70 percent of the shell is exposed by the plastic glass, giving my pet a sense of security when in need of a hiding place.THE FAN: This is the most important part. I can tell it started out as a gimmick, upon seeing other review pictures, the basic design and airflow of the fan seemed incredibly flawed. I can tell this was the main focus for improvement in this bag. The fan is much slimmer and without a vent for direct contact. I can certainly feel the airflow which is somewhat satisfactory for the size. It is certainly audibly quiet and I can feel the breeze easily from 6 inches away, More so if I stick my head in the far opposite corner. The LED is quite bright. I'm happy with this feature.POWER. No battery is included. You must have your own portable USB portable battery. When using the fan on full speed for 3 straight hours, my 10350 MHZ battery pack didn't budge from having 4 power indicators on out of 4.COLOR: There is only ONE color.

It's super comfortable to wear. It has a hidden pocket in the back, that I can fit their leashes/harnesses, and a small bag of food. And a side pocket meant for a portable charger. But the fan doesn't work very well so I use it to hold my travel size cleaning stuff incase I need to wipe down the inside. Also the removable bottom didn't hold very well, nor fit well in the first place. so I just took it out and put towels down in its place. But the most important part is that it's so durable that there's absolutely no way they can rip a whole through anything and escape. Other bags have a fabric mesh. But in this bag the mesh is made of a thicker plastic material so it's impossible to claw through. And the whole thing is pretty big. I even used it to bring my puppy to the vet once.TL/DR : comfortable to wear, ferret escape proof, hidden pockets, good sized with lots of room to move about.

As soon as we bring it out of the closet, she turns into a crotchety old lady, kind of like Jekyll and Hyde, but made entirely out of whiskers and lint. She doesn’t hesitate to let us know how she feels about it either, because she howls incessantly the ENTIRE TIME she’s in there, to the point that she “loses her voice” and her meow and purr are squeaky for day or so afterwards. Since she’s been a robustly healthy girl, the carrier situation wasn’t a huge problem, as she only needed to go to the vet for well visits. Unfortunately, as she entered her sunset years, she has taken up the mantle from the late Wilford Brimley and was recently diagnosed with the diabeetus. Her trips to the vet will be more frequent while we figure out to manage her diabetes with prescription food and insulin shots. Because I am a little extra and I love my cat, I decided that she should travel happy, and in style! She is an indoor cat, but she absolutely loves going outside with a harness and leash, which is how we know it’s the carrier itself that she hates. So as soon as her spaceship arrived, I unpacked it and left it out for a few days with the back open for her to get used to it. Today, I put her harness on (which she happily steps into because she knows it means we are going on an outside adventure!) and put her in the spaceship for a short walk outside. Not only did she *not* hate it (as evidenced by the absence of her singing the song of her people for all to hear) she actually seemed quite cozy and was purring! I gave her a treat as soon as I unzipped it to let her out and she is still my friend so I am calling this backpack a success! I haven’t tried the light or the fan yet because she was only in it very briefly. Also worth noting, is that Kimmy is quite small, weighing in at a whopping 9 pounds 3 ounces as of her last trip to the vet, so I can’t say for sure, but I HIGHLY doubt any of my other 3 cats - who happen to be fat, murder mitt wielding freeloaders - would fit in it. Overall, this backpack is reasonably priced, looks adorable, and Kimmy Katdashian definitely prefers it to her cat carrier, so I think this was a good purchase all around.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States April 26, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '3.0 out of 5 stars You have to buy a separate power source!', 'author': 'Living_Lime_Green', 'rating': 3, 'content': 'The backpack I received has clearly been used though it was sold as a new product. There are four ways I know the bag is not new. 1) The clear protective cover on the ‘window’ was simply Saran Wrap and didn’t even cover the entire window; 2) There are no tags or stickers on the bag that would indicate a new product; 3) One of the external ventilation plates has a mark that is not something that would come from shipping or storing- it’s similar to a rust spot; 4) There was dried organic ‘debris’ on the floor pad (definitely food or post-digestion material).The bag itself is fine. The zipper is awful (it’s plastic and I don’t see it lasting long) and there really should be a second set of zippers so that the bag can be zipped from both sides. I suspect that I’ll want/need to take the bag in to have a better zipper installed. You have to have a separate power source for the light/fan to work and I was not aware of that, so it’s disappointing (my fault- should have read the description better). You cannot charge the fan/light.So far, my assessment is that this bag is not worth the price paid. I paid $60 in a lightening deal and I believe the retail is $100. With no power source, I think $20 needs to be knocked off the price. Since I received a used bag, I also feel like I overpaid.**This is the third cat backpack I’ve ordered and received from Amazon in the past week. The first one was sold as new but was clearly a used bag, and it was not the product that was advertised/ordered. The first bag had no outer protective bag, no window covering film, no tags or stickers, no instructions. The second bag (replacement for the first) was identical to the first -still the wrong model, not what I ordered. The second bag had a protective film on the window, and a generic UPC code sticker on the outer plastic bag, so I’m not 100% certain it was used (sold as new), but it sure didn’t feel/look new. No instructions or tags. I decided to go with another bag and seller with this third backpack. Imagine my surprise when this one appears to be used as well. I’m not sure what’s going on with that, but just something I wanted to share.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 7, 2022', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Alaska Airline approved (window seat only)', 'author': 'guiltygreen', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I searched high and low through the Google abyss to find a cat backpack that:- had a decent window (instead of a bubble)- wouldn't be terribly bulky on a petite body (there are backpacks that would be half of my height)- had great designThis PETKIT backpack was it. First off, it's airline-approved, at least for Alaska Airlines in-cabin, on economy. I was worried this wouldn't fit underneath the seat, because Southwest (another reviewer) had larger under-seat margins. But this backpack fit snugly under the seat in front of me. It will slide about halfway underneath the window-side seat. It will NOT fit fully underneath the middle row seat, so you'll need to take note of that when booking your flights / seat assignment. Airport check-in and customs was fine as well - you can ask for a 'private screening room' if you don't want to take your pet out of the carrier.Now onto the fan and light functions: It's just beautiful.Some buyers don't read the short manual it comes with and then complain that the 'fan and light didn't work.' It explicitly states, in the manual (and I'm pretty sure on the box), that the fan and the light requires an external power bank / battery pack to run. That's it. Simply unzip the side pocket and plug your power bank to the USB cable (built into the backpack). The fan automatically turns on for your pet.My power bank is 4 x 3 inches (10cm x 8cm), but the pocket is big enough to house a power bank of 6 inches (15cm) in height. I thought the features sounded too good to be true online, but they're real! Changing the fan setting from 'Auto' is touch-screen enabled, and turning the light on/ off is just a press and hold. The fan power isn't the strongest, so I wouldn't advise relying on it too much. But it does provide a little extra breeze for kitty. And the light works well too.I think the backpack attracted just as much attention as the kitty. Several people commented on it and never seen such a 'high tech' backpack before. I love the aesthetic and everything about this backpack. It is pricey, but well worth it - did I mention I've had to carry my cat on 2 hour walks or so?

I was uncertain at first if this bag would technically work with our car, as some product reviews and even direct answers from the seller in the Customer Questions indicate that it would not work with an Odyssey with no roof rack. To make sure though, I called the company directly, and the person I talked to at Rightline assured me the bag would work fine for our car. I also found a youtube video of an owner of a Honda Odyssey just like ours who bought and used this bag with good success. After seeing that video, I decided to buy it. We used it last week for a 1,000 mile round trip beach vacation - we needed extra space because we were dropping my son off at college on the way back. The bag itself is very thick, tough material. The zippers are a little tough to work at first, but I was fine with it with the understanding that probably made them more weatherproof. We did not use any kind of pad underneath, and honestly, I don't know why you would need one, as the bag secures very well to the roof after tightening the straps and the underside of it is not abrasive. On our way down, we drove through 5+ hours of heavy rain, and everything inside the bag was bone dry when we arrived at our destination. However, because we dont have a roof rack, we had to attach the bag through the doors (note, this works fine even with sliding doors...). This shouldn't be a problem in dry weather, other than a little extra wind noise. However, the straps and buckles create small gaps in the doors, and water steadily dripped inside our car at all 4 attachment points. It was not pouring in, but with 5 hours of rain, a steady drip adds up and is quite annoying, with seats, floors, and doors getting constantly wet. That's my only complaint...Other than the rain issue, I think the bag is very high quality, secures well to the roof of your car, keeps your stuff dry, and will last a long time."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 17, 2021', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Great affordable option', 'author': 'Evan', 'rating': 4, 'content': ""We used this for driving home for the holidays from MO to SC and it did exactly what we needed it to do. We didn't want to spend the money on a roof rack that we may use only once, so this was a great option! It kept all our items dry. The holes in the zipper are wide enough to leave a lock in to keep your items secure overnight.The only issue we had with this is that the straps that hook into your weather seal will prevent your door from sealing shut. So the wind from driving down the interstate will blast into the openings and is VERY loud. Additionally if it rains, water will leak through the same openings into your vehicle.Other than that, this was perfect for what we needed."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 27, 2023', 'is_verified': True}]"

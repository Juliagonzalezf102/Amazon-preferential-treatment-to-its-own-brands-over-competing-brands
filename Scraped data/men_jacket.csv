It looks very black in the photo but it\'s not a true black. It\'s more of a charcoal gray/slight navy. It doesn\'t bother me but if you are hoping for black, this is not. And the zipper. It\'s very cheap. I could not get it zipped up. I was afraid the little bottom piece would pull away from the fabric. I was very gentle with it but could not get it zipped up while I was wearing it. I had to take it off and lay it face up on my bed and work with it. I finally got it to zip and then zipped it up and down a million times to ""break it in"" but still could not get it re-zipped once I unzipped it again. Bad quality zipper which surprises me coming from a Columbia jacket. Other than these 3 things, it\'s a nice jacket.

The sleeves are fleece-lined, which makes for a warm feel but makes it a bit more difficult to pull it off if I'm wearing long sleeves, especially if I'm wearing a sweater. The other thing I'm not crazy about is that the collar will NEVER lie flat. One side always always always sticks up.

Suddenly, we learned that there was unseasonable snowfall along the Danube and it was going to continue. I was in need of waterproof hiking boots and I bought these on Amazon in last minute desperation. (They arrived literally one hour before we left for the airport!) Because of a bunion on my right foot, I do need a wider shoe but I’ve learned that most wides aren’t truly wide and I sometimes have to buy a men’s size. Not so with these! Although I did swap out the insole with the inserts I wear in my workout shoes for more arch support, these shoes needed no break-in time in Europe. The very first day we were walking in snow in Prague and over the course of 10 days, I walked an average of 6 miles a day in snowy, icy cities. The shoes felt like I had been wearing them for months already. No blisters, no red spots from rubbing, just a really comfortable shoe that kept my feet dry and warm. I’m so excited about these that, even though these were on sale, I’m going to buy a second pair in another color at full price. I’m very impressed.Oh, and extra points for the quick lace up option at the top.

I felt like a fool for never connecting the dots. Lol.Well…I found these, loved the color options and the reviews seemed pretty legit! I’ve worn them twice so far while running errands to see how they feel and I have to say, no discomfort and so lightweight!!Now down to sizing: With stylish boots, I’m typically a size 8, and I did order an 8 initially, however with a thin sock, they felt pretty snug and I thought maybe they might start to bother my toes since there’s more cushion that what I’m used to and what if I want to wear thick socks?For me that was enough to go up to an 8.5 juuuust to be on the safe side and because…why not find out? $75 is still $75.So glad I did! They feel roomier yet still a great fit, so if you’re in limbo, I’d say size up .5 if you want to be able to throw these on without switching your socks. 😉Happy I got these and I’m looking forward being more active!', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 24, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': ""5.0 out of 5 stars 3rd Time WAS a Charm! Only took 5 tries to find Prince Charming's Boot!"", 'author': 'FLGulfGrnEz', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I read the reviews wherever I could find them. I had become very confused over the sizing. I have a hard enough time getting the right size without this much of a difference thrown at me too!I was in love @first glance, beautiful dark gray with aqua strings. Ordered size 7 as suggested though I wear a size 6.5 or 6. Feet measures a size 5-5.5, L=8.5"" R=8.7"". There lies the rub, right foot doesn\'t fit sizes same as left one by a fraction so hit or miss. Also, remember, as you age, your feet spread causing sizing up like me to 6.5 in shoes, 7 usually in boots but style can put you back to regular size if they are rounded toe box or squared box mostly in western styles. Shoes strings are very helpful as they can be adjusted to make more room, not more length. Mules are easier to get by smaller sized if you don\'t have toes that won\'t go entire way down, heel hangs off, usually good bet as mostly open. Overall best choice in any type of foot covering is ""Leather"", your friend for stretching if little small as they will mold to feet, put in a cushion before wearing though. Zippers are the bomb for higher topped boots/shoes especially with fat feet, high instep, opens the slimmer top for feet to get to sole.Back to the size sessions; First was great price on 7\'s, looked order back up and saw where I had ordered from the warehouse! Wow, what a great mistake... for my sis! Really, check it out. What others say about buying ""like new"", warehouse, etc., if you don\'t check it out, you are making HUGE mistake. I would never had known if not curious then found sticker where stated, ""checked by warehouse"". Besides, if you don\'t like what you receive, give them to your sis for Christmas! If that\'s not acceptable, check returns, usually can send back w/30 days from Amazon, look at rules though. Truly, you need to check the other items like ones we sometimes just look at and Nope, return. Perfect shape, they get sold cheaper w/new ones @less cost.Wanted those boots but those 7\'s were too great price, that\'s why sis got them and was gaga over them. So, I ordered size 6, suggested 6.5, too bad, too big but kept just in case.... the size 5\'s I was ordering now, 3rd try, didn\'t fit even though suggested I wear a 6 now! Well the 5\'s came and went, that fraction of inch on R foot, felt fine, but only for few minutes, just fraction too small in toes based on R foot!Last and 4th time! Wow! That tells you how badly I wanted these shoes, they just checked off too many boxes to let them go without a good fight. The 5.5\'s I was sure would fit in a WIDE, had been costly, at over $100 if remember correctly. Figures! Only size left & at most expensive price! Waited a day later, 5.5W\'s & more sizes had come in, ordered them up and got them in about a day. When I saw them, crossed fingers as I thought they were a yes. I have them on now, they feel like they should have been on my feet the whole time! So, the size 5.5W is my size w/just enough room for thick socks or thinner ones. I live in Florida, though kids live in Denver & Boise & France. These will work out fine for all places as it is warm today here & fit & feel great!Updated: 12/1/23, getting later, quicker! After size 7, 6, 5, 5.5W and guess what? Another size 6 was ordered at new price 1/2 of all others, came few days later. Probably wondering what was wrong w/1st size 6\'s? Nothing, just needed to make sure of correct size due to computer blindness, too much shopping. I was getting goofy and thought perhaps all in my head, being too careful. What actually happened was I realized when I put those 5\'s on, I\'d be needing really thick, wool socks and they would be more conducive & warmer to wear in a size 6!!!! Ran to Ross, bought thick wool socks, 2 pairs, eh cheap try. I have finally found my problem, I am a Floridian going to frozen U.S. This past Thursday it was really cold here and even wearing great boots w/socks feet were freezing in few minutes on way to HOA meeting! Thank goodness I used my ""prior northern snow experience"" to kick me in head, loosen up screws and I now firmly believe that I had probably needed to size down one size smaller than the size 7 suggested to the size 6 (I got twice!) or try a wide in next small size if all left. I know I really needed the room, which these boots have plenty of and are warm whereas my Frye\'s were made for Florida & no thick socks! The only dilemma w/sizing is the extra room throughout/around entire toe bed & instep w/room to spare, it\'s the length to think about, like I finally did. I also put in a shoe cushion to help with some of the extra room, then thick socks won over. Still have plenty of room through toe bed area but TOO PRETTY, COMFY & TIRED to second guess anymore, size 6 it is!Merry Christmas Folks! Good Luck with your sizing, hope this finally solves some problems??? It was the socks that made all the difference which I kept hearing in almost every review but didn\'t hear the bell in head go off... All\'s good that ends with most comfortable boot for warm & still is especially fab for cold, wet wool sock weather! I can go snow boarding now!

I ordered a brand new pair and also went and bought the warehouse inspected used one on additional discount. The used pair is in perfect condition, not a mark or sign of wear anywhere on them. They’re just like the brand new pair. Perfect!I wear orthotics in my shoes, I tried them both with and without them to see how they feel. I will of course wear them with the orthotics otherwise my plantar fasciitis will get inflamed. I want to wear one pair at work which is standing on my feet my entire shift on cement floors and the other for daily use or camping etc. I will also be spraying a treatment on them for additional protection against the elements.I do have wide feet. One being bigger and slightly wider than the other as well. I always wore a 6.5 shoe, but I guess my feet spread out over time so now I wear 7.5-8 shoes/boots. I went with the 7.5 wide on these and they feel just fine. If I got 8s I think they’d have been too long and I’d be tripping on my own feet. Definitely glad I got the wides they would have been too narrow if I got the regular ones. The orthotics raise my foot in the shoe so I have to loosen the laces a lot to accommodate and this is the first time I’ve had extra length on the laces to tie rather than a teeny amount to tie my shoes!For today I am wearing these around the house to break them in. They feel fine out of the box but I tend to get foot fatigue easily due to my foot condition so I need to break them in. My baby toes always get the brunt of the pain when wearing shoes and especially new shoes. I haven’t felt that pain right away like I normally would. So that’s a plus for comfort!!So far I love these and so glad I bought both pairs! I love the color and the red laces. They remind me of the old hiking boots I used to see growing up, only a more comfortable updated version!

I was out there for over an hour walking through nearly knee high snow, both shoveling/clearing off cars in my drive way. I love these shoes. Not only this but I had to go to work and play outside in the snow with my preschool kids and same thing, nice and dry. I also wore them all day, 8-5, and my feet feel great! Though I haven’t used them for what I actually asked for them for, I can tell they will perform just as well as they have already! So buy them you won’t regret it:)', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 8, 2024', 'is_verified': True}]"

The sleeves are attached at a sensible angle so it is possible to raise the arms freely and move freely, which is a very welcome feature, thank you Amazon!The Material / Stretch: I have three colors: the red buffalo plaid, charcoal heather and navy blue. The charcoal heather and navy blue are a traditional fleece that has some normal stretch to it but is not a ""stretch"" fabric. The red plaid feels more like a felt that doesn\'t stretch very much. I like them all but the red plaid is a bit tight in the elbows at first but does eventually stretch to fit.Warmth: It is a mid-weight fleece like advertised. I wear it indoors like a sweater.Pockets: The inner wall of the pockets are constructed of the same fleece as the jacket, so that creates two layers of fleece in those areas, making the jacket feel thicker in that area but not bulky. I would prefer pockets made of a thinner mesh or fabric but that isn\'t a big issue. The extra fabric adds some warmth that some people will prefer. Pockets are deep and have zippers so are both warm and secure.I\'ve had these jackets for about 6 weeks and wear them frequently, sometimes with a vest over the top for additional warmth when needed.

And if by chance, it may shrink due to the dryer etc., not to worry because you could always bring it back to its original size. I was taught many years ago, that if, and when, any of your garments shrink due to the dryer, hot water 💦 etc., you can always bring it back to its normal size by rewashing it in cold water 💦 🌊 using Downey fabric softener. Do not use a generic brand. What this does is, it relaxes and extends the fibers allowing it to return back to its normal size. Nor do you want to put it back in the dryer (you must air dry it) or else you'll be back to square one. Don't tell anyone; let it be your little secret.besides,the color is nice and bold. One thing that I like is, that it's a very lightweight. I chose a lightweight because I have others that are medium weight, and another that is a heavyweight.But what I like the most is, that it also has zipperd pockets that zip up, rather than zip down. And the reason why I like zipper pockets is, because you can rest assured that you won't lose your keys or other belongings if you zip it up versus zipping it down.

For the price, it's much warmer than I thought and has well thought out features. So far I've worn this in 42F weather, coldest and just going on a walk I was breaking a bit of a sweat with it half zipped. It has 2 exterior pockets and 2 internal pockets. Personally I wouldn't put too much in these, as I can really feel the thing stretch and drag down. Just gloves, hat, phone etc. should be fine, nothing like a can of soda or something. Water resistance is what you expect for thin nylon stuff, a few drops is fine, actual rain, get an umbrella or an actual waterproof layer. It's also pretty windproof, took it out in the aftermath of a pseudo hurricane and didn't feel the wind.It packs down pretty well into a 6 inch long 3 inch or so bundle but nothing like the high tech hiking stuff, I just wish there was a shorter loop so I can carabiner it to my pack easier but seems like it was intended to be carried like an umbrella. Also wish it packed into itself rather than have a bag which may get lost one day. The material imo isn't very durable, I have no rips yet, but I'm not confident and think if I rub on something the wrong way it's going to tear. The stitching seems fine so far, and doesn't seem to be leaking filler yet.Sizing wise, I have a 45 chest and usually wear XL, but this is kinda big even for an XL, maybe because they were antiicpating you layer something like a thick sweater underneath. It is also a bit long for my torso, about 2-3 inches more than I need to sit at my waist. I have 23 sleeves and that fits perfect.I don't expect this to last a long time, but it's useful for the time I'll have it.12/28 edit:So I just used this exactly for what I bought it for because of the huge winter storm that swept across the north and east coast US. Temps went from nearly 60 degrees in daytime all the way down to 23 by late afternooon with extremely high winds that were throwing doors around and knocked some street signs off their mounts, and it was perfect.

The jacket I purchased is yellow. I wanted something that would be adequately warm on a cool spring day so I wouldn’t have to bring another sweatshirt or have to pack long sleeve shirts. I also wanted something that folded up very small as I was only taking a backpack for 10 days. This jacket fit the bill perfectly. It comes with a bag which will compress the jacket down to about the size of a smaller shoe, but the way I found best to pack it was to fold it into quarters, flat, and put it on top of my clothes in my backpack. The jacket would compress almost completely flat, adding almost no bulk to my bag. It was like a magic trick how small it became. When I wanted to have it handy, but did not want to carry it, I would stick it through the handle of my backpack, pulling it halfway through, and it would stay there securely when I put my bag into overhead luggage storage on the Italo and Eurostar, making to easy to grab if I became cold. There were some cold and very windy evenings and nights when we were in London and Paris (50 degrees F, with a strong breeze coming off the Thames and Seine) and this jacket kept me warm with just a t-shirt on underneath. I encountered a brief rain shower on the Path of the Gods and stayed dry and the jacket dried pretty quickly. I can’t speak to how well it would perform in a heavy downpour as that was the only rain I experienced during my trip. Overall, this jacket was perfect for me and at the price point, I was not going to be upset if it got lost, stolen, or ruined. After being stuffed in my bag over and over and shoved into overhead storage, the jacket still looks brand new. Not to mention it looked stylish in all of the photos my wife and I took! I am 6’6” and weigh about 190lbs and I bought a large. It fit well without a lot of extra bulk and the sleeves were long enough for my wingspan. 10/10, would recommend!', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 31, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Philmont Approved!!!!', 'author': 'Shawshank', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I purchased two of these jackets as a lightweight backpackable jacket for our 12-day Philmon trek in the Sangre Cristo mountains of Northern New Mexico. During our trek, we had 2.5 days of rain in altitudes over 9,000 feet. The lowest temps were mid to high 40\'s, windy and wet! These jackets did an outstanding job of keeping us both dry and warm. In fact, during one particularly heavy rain, I discovered my old Army ACU wet weather top was in fact no longer waterproof. I pulled off the top and this jacket which I had underneath my wet weather top was soaked in the front, back, and arms. However that moisture/wetness never touched my skin. This jacket also served as part of my pillow setup and in spite of the exterior being wet, and in the absence of NNM\'s low humidity, the jacket dried quickly, and I was able to use it as my pillow. I would without hesitation recommend, and purchase these jackets again. When I say ""Philmont Approved"", just know that means more than someone\'s opinion after taking it out of the package and posing in front of a mirror. To recap the benefits:1) Lightweight: The jacket packs easily into the included bag and was attached to a carabiner on the outside of my backpack. It stayed secure through bushwhacking trails, hiking through trees that tried to grab everything, and scaling up and down some steep mountainsides. My son kept his bag attached to the loop in the jacket and that worked very well for him.2) Water resistant: We both wore these during a few days of sprinkling rain and 2.5 days of legit rain- rain. Water never breached the inside of the jacket and made contact with our skin. That is a win!3) Warm: This jacket kept us warm in the very cool mountain air of Northern New Mexico, both dry and wet weather. I\'m not going to tell you that this jacket will keep you warm in freezing temps because we did not encounter that kind of weather. But I will tell you that when it was in the mid 40\'s and my sleeping bag zipper was broken, and I was quite cold, I put this jacket on (and lost part of my pillow) but was warm and toasty!4) Quality: The zippers work great. Zippered external pockets were a huge plus to reduce the chance of important things (like snacks or other small doodads that I used) from falling out and being lost. The deep interior pockets were great for holding my phone (for pictures). The only issue I had was that I tore the loop out. It was dark and I was having a hard time getting the bag unknotted and broke the loop by force. It wasn\'t a failure on the jacket - it was a failure on my patience!5) Dries quickly: After it got wet underneath my ""notta wet weather top"" it dried quickly and was able to fulfill it\'s purpose as part of my pillow setup.Summary: This is a solid choice for a lightweight outer shell for cooler weather, and will work even if there is some rain in the forecast. It is lightweight and breathable enough to work as a sub-layer if you have a lightweight rain jacket to help break the wind. I did not notice the wind getting through this jacket, so I believe it serves well in that regard. Also, if it survived my teenage Scout and all his rambunctious rock climbing and goofing around, then it should serve you well. I purchased the Dark Olive Green because it\'s similar to the Ranger Green clothes I wear for Boy Scouts, and my son purchased the Light Brown because he likes that color. Both colors look good. The Light Brown is similar to Coyote Brown, but a little darker.

Because the jacket is gusseted, it allows for full range of motion even with the jacket fully zipped and buttoned. The jacket has an adjustable waste cord, which I have not had to touch. Another nice feature is the jacket length, which falls at pocket level on a pair of jeans. The jacket is slightly longer in the back than in the front, which keeps it from riding up.Storage: The jacket has six pockets. Two front ""hand"" pockets, two buttoned breast pockets, an additional front left breast pocket with a center Velcro closure, which makes for a handy place to hold pencils, and an interior zip pocket on the left, which I use to keep my wallet secure. Pocket depth has not been an issue, and I keep an IPhone 13 in the front hand pocket with no issues.Warmth: The jacket is Sherpa lined. I\'ve worn it hours in 25-32 degree temps and was comfortable with just a T-shirt under a Henley shirt. I would say that it would be comfortable to work in from 20-50 degrees. The zipper (right zipper) also has a button cover, making it that much more air tight. The sleeves are cuffed, though they don\'t appear to be at a glance. These cuffs really help with keeping cold air from seeping into the arms, especially if you\'re like me and you like to wear a thinner undershirt while working. There is a Sherpa-lined attached hood as well.Construction: This jacket feels heavy duty. The zipper is beefy, the buttons solid, and the overall construction is solid. I feel like I can use and abuse this jacket without destroying it. The duck outer lining is not soft cotton, but it moves, and feels strong without being stiff.Appearance: This is not a bad looking jacket and I might even call it stylish. I would feel fine wearing this while out and about.Demerits. I give this jacket one demerit, and it is a very minor demerit, and that is the attached hood. I like the hood, I like how it lays on the back when not in use without feeling bulky, I just wish that it could be removed. This is a very minor quibble, however.Overall I highly recommend this jacket if you are in the market for warm, heavy duty, and practical work wear. It is not inexpensive, but I feel it is worth every penny. In fact, I would go as far to say that even if you aren\'t in the market for a work jacket, but only warm jacket that can take a beating, then this jacket is worth considering.

For colder than freezing, I prefer longer coats.- Relatively light-weight. A lot of winter coats are extremely heavy. This one is mid-weight.- Feels durable. The fabric is sturdy and the coat seems well made.- Lots of pockets. I wish the side pockets had zippers, but they are a good placement for keeping your hands warm.Cons:- Snap buttons are difficult to close. Especially with gloved hands, the snaps are very difficult to get closed. You need one hand on either side of the fabric to press them together.- Too wide at the shoulders. This should not be an issue for the target clientele.- Bulky. If I was able to order a smaller size, this likely would not be an issue.

The commercial ones range from $150 for very light weight ones to $400+ for heavier duty ones. I like the Levi brand and have had good luck with their construction quality in pants before, and their design looks great to me with the Sherpa lining and detachable hood.I’m 6’1” 275 lbs with longer arms & torso that usual for my height. Fit is an issue for me with sleeves coming up short unless I oversized and drown in coats or jackets. The xxl tall option online fits perfectly for an overcoat in high 20’s to low 40’s weather with normal layers underneath. It is too warm for me in the high 40’s or above.The zipper quality feels good for the jacket and the removeable hood inserts. The hood insert is the same gauge zipper as the jacket, but the attachment zipper side is different. You won’t be able to zip on some other shell lining or fleece into that as I thought I could from stock photos.I applied wax and melted it in with a heat gun. Anything but pure cotton canvas could melt or burn from that, so I was worried about the polyester lining. It all came out very well in my opinion, and the canvas held up to the rough and strenuous waxing process on all the seams. None of the liner got stuck to the shell, and nothing melted.The buttons on the wrist adjustment and pockets don’t have much holding power, so it’s easy to unbutton your wrist cuff against things. That’s better than it getting hung up on things and ripping though I guess.The had warmer pockets so have a good lining, but I’m indifferent to the pho button pocket detailing. It doesn’t hurt anything, but I could do without it. The hand pockets are pretty deep for gloves, keys, or a phone. Be careful with phones in those pockets while sitting especially like in a car slightly tilted backwards. My phone falls out there easily but never while I’m walking around. The breast pockets are good for that with a reasonable sized phone & case though.I really like the brown color both when new and after taking some darker colors from the wax.

(it softens)', 'author': 'Jesse McClure', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Last night I was planning on giving this jacket a 1-star review based primarily on the material which seemed horrible and unwearable. It\'s polyester, but seemed not like polyester cloth for clothes but rather the polyester that\'d be in plastic bottles. I was tempted to say that this could either be thrown in the garbage, or have garbage thrown into it (e.g., it\'s a plastic garbage bag). But I tried putting it through a laundry cycle (normal wash, cool tumble dry) and I\'m glad I did. It came out *soo* much softer.It\'s still not particularly ""soft"" when compared to other materials, but it now feels on par with normal clothing-grade polyester and is certainly wearable (it really wasn\'t before being washed). It still doesn\'t scream quality - but it\'s a functional cheap jacket for spring. Given the low price, this adds up to a pretty good value.EDIT: 1 Year Update:I\'ve upgraded my review from 4 to 5 stars. The original review is above and still holds true. But I\'ve come to really love this jacket and it\'s proven to be incredibly durable after a year of fairly regular use and a whole lot of abuse.I do have one gripe: the zipper on the inside pocket tends to get stuck a lot on the thin flaps of material meant to cover the zipper. This is not a great design. However, given just how many times this zipper has gotten stuck, and the fact that I have no patience to deal with such an issue delicately and instead I just pull on it as hard as I can to break it free ... given this abuse, it\'s amazing that the zipper is still just fine. I\'ve had much more expensive coats where if material gets stuck in a zipper it\'s game over for that zipper.This jacket\'s durability overall matches this zipper too: this is the cheapest (price) jacket I\'ve ever owned, and I\'ve treated it as such. It\'s seen a lot of carelessness and abuse. It\'s been left on the filthy seat in my truck reserved just for my dog ... and it\'s been stepped / sat on by that dog. The jacket\'s been shoved into various spots, twisted, tugged, and abused in every way imaginable. Yet after a year of this there are no rips, no tears, no snags, no broken zippers, no fraying seems. The jacket still looks like it did on day 2 (after the first wash - as noted in the original review, it looked like crap on day 1).Despite being the most affordable jacket I\'ve ever owned this definitely my favorite light weight jacket. So much so that I\'ll likely get another in a different color.

The zipper on the chest pocket should really be the same style as the main jacket zipper bc it keeps getting stuck on the protective flap when you go to zip or unzip the pocket.

A little trick that I\'ll share with you that was taught to me many years ago, is: if for whatever reason any of your garments shrink due to the dryer or whatever?, you can still bring it back to its original size by you rewashing it in cold water 💦 💦 🌊 and useing Downy fabric softener. Do Not! use a generic brand. What this does is that it softens and relaxes, and extends the fibers allowing it to return to its original size. But the trick is to air dry it.

Thanks Amazon!The coat itself is very comfy (2XL) and there is room under it for a hoodie or sweatshirt. Its a little less roomy than some other 2XL outerwear I have but there is enough room for bulkier clothing under it (layering). The main reason I got it was for an upcoming trip to Alaska we have planned for later this year and wanted something that was fleece lined for a bit more warmth in 40-60 degree weather w/wind/rain. My existing waterproof-ish coat has no lining and would not be very warm in those temps w/wind/rain. Can\'t include how it did for that yet but will update the review when I get back, later this year.So far so good. Provides the additional protective layer I was looking for and is water-""repellent"", not just resistant. Allows for winter work outside the house (shoveling/snow blowing, etc) without getting cold or sweaty under it like a warmer coat would. Plenty of pockets, zippers appear to be good quality, removable hood is nice too as that may allow for more casual wear in the colder months and during that trip coming up.

Great Price.', 'author': 'REH', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Extremely happy with my purchase. The coat looks great and looks of decent quality for the price. It\'s nice to be able to stay outside the $200-$400 higher side coat price range and get something that looks good and fashionable. I rotate clothes a lot, so having several winter coat options at more reasonable prices fits the bill perfectly, just as this coat does. And, at the price, if can get 1 or 1.5 seasons wear, I\'m happy.As for coat fit, I\'m 6\'3"", 34x34 pant, 15 1/2"" neck, 36"" sleeve, 40"" chest, 175 lbs, more triangular build. The large fits a bit loose at top, but that\'s my issue as I prefer a bit tighter fitting clothing. So, not a manufacturer problem in my opinion as some online clothes can be. More so, I wouldn\'t downsize due to the sleeve length which was absolutely perfect. And, above all, the extra size accommodation at top, of course, is likely given to accommodate a suit/sport coat underneath. And, while peoples suit/sport coats length can vary, if my suit/sport coat is buttoned, this coat covers such an undercoat just fine. If the suit/sport coat is unbuttoned, that coat hangs a bit out from underneath from this coat. Not an issue. Just FYI. And, with my preference for likely wearing with just a sweater, this size will be great and as tailored to one as one can expect from ordering online.I ordered the coffee 01 color, and no disappointment there. What I saw in the pictures, is what I got. I was worried the blend might look a bit cheesy. But, no. Very refined looking and just the color I wanted.Some people said they didn\'t like the buttons, that they are maybe a bit flashy, i.e., not just solid color or standard brown/black. If you are way conservative in dressing, or need that, perhaps so. I get it. But, I think they are a nice accent. I worried a bit about that too. But, when I got the coat. Not a problem at all. Looks great and if a real concern I think the coat is worth it to have a tailor put on the buttons you want.Last, there seems to be a bit of confusion on the reviews as to whether its too short or that its more of a waist coat. Yes, this version is. For me, it fits more to my upper thigh, or right at mid-point on pants pockets. HOWEVER!!!, within the color options, different lengths are presented, so beware! And that is perhaps what people are noting. One color you like, might be a different coat style/length than another color you like. So, carefully read the description and look at the sleeve bottom to coat bottom ratio in the pictures for length approximation or read the size charts, which I think pretty accurately depict the difference.I picked up on this difference and decided to also order a longer length coat in another color by this manufacturer, in case the first didn\'t seem to fit as I wanted. I am keeping both! as these are really decent wardrobe additions and each of the lengths I thought I was picking is exactly what I got. One other point on some of the comments, this coat did come with a scarf. The other coat under this manufacturer that I got with the listing shown to come with a scarf, did not. So people have noted this. Perhaps true. But, in seeing that possibility ahead of time before ordering, I knew scarf or no scarf was not going to be a deal breaker at this price. Also, I believe some folk contacted the manufacturer and got the scarf separately. Again, not a deal breaker for my purpose.Anyhow, long review....but I was really impressed with the coat(s) from this brand/manufacturer. In buying 2 at still a fraction of a $400 single coat price, I can rotate and likely get better dress options and similar wear, and I will look for this seller\'s clothing in the future.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 1, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars An excellent look for the price', 'author': 'Chris Carter', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Overall, this jacket looks much more expensive than it is.

I\'ve been wearing it for a few weeks now and have received multiple compliments (mostly from random guys) on how it looks. The built in inner scarf (which is annoying to actually connect to your jacket with the super tiny stretchy loops) gives a great boost of color. It\'s also more than warm enough for winter, especially if you layer it with a long sleeve shirt or sweater.Onto the less than great parts. While the length is perfect, the chest region is a bit tight. I\'m about 5\'9"" and 160-165lbs and the medium is restrictive in my shoulders and arms, so much so that I usually prefer to take my jacket off when driving as you need unrestricted full use of your limbs to drive. The other down side is that the right pocket had a giant hole in the bottom that fed into the insulation portion of the bottom of the jacket. The actual insulation is light and feels like pulled apart cotton balls (not a bad thing, just weird). I had to sew it up and now it feels weird because I\'m horrible at sewing. I probably could have exchanged it...but I ordered it late into winter here and needed a new coat so I dealt with it.Otherwise, for this price this jacket was well worth it.

I placed my arm under my water spigot and the water just bounced off and two quick shakes of my arm and it was dry. The inner liner is very good at storing body heat so you could probably get away with this being a three season jacket if you live in an area with relatively mild winters.FeaturesThere are four pockets on the jacket I have, two traditional waist-level jacket pockets on the left and right with an inner pocket and an outer left arm pocket. The two hand pockets are decent but a little shallower than I expected. The inner pocket is nicely sized and readily falls to hand. I will likely never use left arm pocket as it feels odd to access and awkward to zip back up. Speaking of zippers, all of them appear to be of at least decent quality as the zippers feel decently robust and the tracks are metal. It is a bit annoying that the main zipper on this jacket is on the left which is different than any other jacket I have owned and takes a little brain retraining to get use to.OverallI have spent a lot of money on jackets in the past but also got my money\'s worth. I went a bit cheaper this time but I am pretty impressed even in the short time I\'ve worn this one. I will add an edit if this impression changes due to unexpected quirks or wear.December 2023 Update: 2nd JacketThis jacket has been great and despite rolling around on concrete more often than I cared to as well as doing a lot of other more tasks that would cause wear, I bought a new one to wear when going out.

I am used to the fit, and knew what to expect when ordering, so there were no surprises here. This is the insulated version, so it is a little warmer than the cheaper non insulated version. Do yourself a favor and choose this one over the non insulated version. The non insulated jacket is no warmer than a thin flannel shirt. This one actually holds in some heat. This is by no means a heavy jacket, however. Im a skinny guy, so I get cold in the 60s and 70s. This jacket provides enough warmth for me down to the 40s. But in the 60s, if I\'m working/moving around, it actually gets a bit hot.So, yes it is a ""light"" jacket, but not so light that it wont do any good in the 40s and 50s. Also it\'s not too heavy (in my opinion) for temperatures in the 60s.The lining is like a polyester type, very smooth and feels good on the arms. I prefer this to cotton or wool type linings. This is only preference, but just thought you should know, in case you prefer the more cotton type lining.So the fitment is probably what you are most curious about. This style of jacket is short and meant to be more fitted than other jackets. The sleeves come to your wrist (with average arm length). The bottom of the jacket stops at the waist, maybe slightly above depending on your torso length. If you\'re wearing the correct size jacket, when you move, this jacket may feel ""too small"" for you. Meaning the sleeves will come above your wrists when stretching your arms, or the bottom will rise above your waist line. You will feel it slightly constricting shoulder movement. If this is what you want, then order the correct size. If you prefer a little more breathing/movement room, then order the next size UP.Just for reference, I\'m 5\'11"" 145 pounds, fairly skinny. I wear a small in most jackets, small-medium t-shirts, small work shirts/uniform shirts. But I don\'t like baggy shirts and jackets. So a small in this Dickies jacket is perfect for me. If you are about the size of me, and prefer more fitted shirts and jackets, then the small should be good for you. If you like them more baggy, then go with the medium.This theory should work across the spectrum in all the sizes. If you like fitted coats, then get the size you would normally get. If you like them more loose and baggy, then get the next size up.All in all this is a great buy on a very durable jacket. I work on cars for a living so this jacket gets daily use and abuse throughout the fall and winter. Even with all the abuse, I still get a few years out of these jackets. That\'s not to say they are worn out after a few years, they just get so stained and faded, it\'s time to get a new one. But at this price point, you could get a couple at a time, and wear them forever.Oh an one more thing. If you\'re looking at other work jackets on Amazon, you may notice many of them say the proportions are all screwed up...Like oversized arms or torso areas. Weird proportions that make you like Popeye or something. The Dickies jacket IS NOT like that. If you get the correct size, you will not look weird like you may with other brand jackets.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 21, 2016', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '1.0 out of 5 stars Not that warm - Zipper broke after 3 or months of use.', 'author': 'Bob', 'rating': 1, 'content': ""Fits tight, not as warm as you would think as they describe.

If only more manufacturers offered tall sizes. You’d be surprised how many of us there are out there that would buy more online if those existed.Tailoring was the secret sauce to making the XXL work, a necessity for the style-conscious athletic build.Now, let\'s talk about the zipper – it\'s the bane of this otherwise great jacket.

This jacket deserves a 5-star review for its exceptional quality, durability, and style.The first thing that caught my attention was the material. The jacket is made with a high-quality, heavyweight cotton canvas that feels incredibly sturdy and well-made. I have no doubt that this jacket will last me for years to come, even with regular wear and tear.The fit of the jacket is also perfect. It's not too loose or too tight, and the sleeves are just the right length. The full zip design makes it easy to put on and take off, and the collar is the perfect height to keep my neck warm on chilly days.Another feature I love about this jacket is the number of pockets. There are plenty of pockets to store my phone, wallet, keys, and other essentials. The pockets are also deep enough to keep my belongings secure and prevent them from falling out.Lastly, the style of this jacket is impeccable. The rustic, rugged look is perfect for outdoor activities like hiking or camping, but it's also stylish enough to wear casually with jeans or khakis. The attention to detail on this jacket is impressive, from the stitching to the zipper pulls.Overall, I highly recommend the Legendary Whitetails Men's Rugged Full Zip Dakota Jacket to anyone looking for a high-quality, durable, and stylish jacket.

From the good, the bad, to the unfortunate.The Good:The prices on Amazon for these jackets are amazing! The jackets are beautiful, well made, thick with sherpa insulation in the torso and plenty of thick insulation in the arms. The denim washes are consistent throughout the garment and look just like the pictures you see pictured online. In my opinion they are simply strong, well made, beautiful jackets. I love them.but....The Bad:The arms in these jackets run narrow, so if you have any sort of upper arm musculature they will be tight, too tight. This will force you into buying the next larger size jacket in order to increase the arm width (which is still snug but doable). The problem now is the jacket will be longer and wider in the torso... That's an issue because the jacket simply looks too big, wide, and long!The Solutions:1) Some folks have tried getting around this by buying the larger size, washing and drying in order to shrink the garment (because shrinkage mostly occurs in the length of the arms and torso and a little bit in width), then wear the garment to try and stretch out the denim. Remember it is denim so it will stretch quite a bit just like your jeans do... BUT there is no guarantee it will shrink enough in all the areas you want for a perfect fit..2) You pay a tailor to increase the upper arm width by sewing in extra denim fabric or stretch fabric...3) You go to Sears or a local Levis location and try on a dozen jackets to find one that fits you just right...4) You buy a vintage 70's, 80's, 90's pre-owned jacket which were cut larger in the arms back then...Point is this: If you are tall and slender with slender arms the jacket will fit. If you are overweight with thin arms the jacket will fit. If you are built with a keg like torso and stick like arms the jacket will fit.The Unfortunate:However... If you are athletic in any way and have average muscle size, medium muscles, larger muscles, or huge muscles the jacket will not fit your arms... period. The jacket will fit in the shoulders and the torso but not the arms. Can you see the recurring theme here?My solution:I tried both the large and the XL and neither fit my arms properly and were way too wide and long in the body. (Therefore I had to return them to Amazon.) Unfortunately I ended up going to a local retailer (paid way more than if purchased through amazon) tried on 20+ jackets, got lucky, and found something I could break in. I also bought another one (by going the vintage route via ebay) which worked out even better because they were made bigger and different back then.Great jackets but terrible fit. All Levis needs to do is increase the upper arm width by 1.5 inches in order to compensate for the extra insulation put there. This is why the Sherpa jackets have this sizing problem because the manufacturers are using the pre-existing un-insulated denim jackets as the base model, filling it up with sherpa and arm insulation and....boom....poor fitting jackets."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States July 13, 2018', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Looks great with your hands in the pockets.', 'author': '66Mustang', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""Good fit, looks good.

It’s nice that you can button it up when you’re cold and unbutton it as it gets warmer. The side pockets are really hefty and you can stick your phone in there and other stuff.

Obviously, this masculine shirt/jacket is long on me (comes just to the bottom of my seat when unbuttoned) and has arms that are too wide for me, but I like it anyway. In chilly days in the South, it provides good warmth as a jacket. Made in Vietnam, it's clearly a quality garment, with neat stitching, buttonholes that line up perfectly with the buttons, a wider collar that can be positioned upward, inside pockets that are 9.5 inches deep and 5.5 inches wide, and firmer outside pockets (which functionally are not as deep because of the angle of the opening). This soft fleece shirt/jacket is comfortable. The buttonholes are a little tight, but that is better than buttons being too loose to remain fastened. There is a spare button adhered to the inside left tag. This shirt/jacket has more of a straight cut which means that someone with a large belly would probably need to size up if planning to wear it buttoned. Of100% polyester, this shirt/jacket has a side tag indicating the garment should not be dry cleaned, but can be machine washed inside-out, using cold water and a gentle cycle, and machine-dried on a gentle cycle. After washing I plan to put it in the dryer for just a few minutes, and then hang to dry, as I do with most of my clothes. An update will be provided if any problems occur after washing it.I’d previously bought this shirt/jacket in dark green as a gift, but after seeing its quality, purchased the light gray for myself. The dark green color is similar to, but actually lighter than the illustration. The illustration for the light gray shirt/jacket, however, is representative of its actual color. I like the jacket so much that I just purchased a 3rd one in the indigo blue heather color. It is reported to be darker than the light blue denim color illustration. This Amazon Essentials garment is well-made and is a good value.02/12/24 Update: Subsequently purchased a shirt/jacket in Medium in blue heather. The lower stomach area is narrower than that of both the green and light grey ones. The label was checked but reflected medium- the same size as the 2 previously purchased. Whether just an anomaly for this particular jacket or all are smaller in blue heather isn't known.

This jacket is exactly what I wanted. I get compliments almost every time I wear it and now all my friends want one!Pricing:I don’t usually spend more than $30 on clothing, but I really wanted this jacket, so I decided to splurge a little. Plus, Carhartt is a reliable brand, so I know it will last me a very long time. I looked into a few other brands (Dickies, Patagonia, etc.), but I felt that Carhartt was a better fit for what I was looking for. I considered getting a jacket from Dickies ($139.99) that was close to identical, but I decided to go with Carhartt ($109) because not only was it more cost-efficient, but it seemed warmer and more stylish as well.Pros:The jacket is nice and warm without being too heavy and goes with almost any outfit. I also love that Carhartt tends to look even better with a little wear and tear over time, unlike some other brands. This way I don’t have to treat it like a new pair of white shoes and be worried about getting a little scuff or dirt on it. It is extremely durable, so if that’s what you’re looking for, look no further!Potential Cons:You should be aware that when you first get the jacket it may feel bulky and tough, but it is easy to break in. I washed it a couple of times according to the instructions on the tag and it is much better now. It was a bit big on me (as I was expecting), so I threw it in the dryer after I washed it and it did shrink a little bit, but definitely not too much. For reference, I am 5’2 and 110 lbs and I got the mens small. It is still a little big on me even after shrinking it, but that’s exactly what I was aiming for. The zipper can be a little sticky at times, but it hasn’t been a big issue for me so far. One thing you should know is that it is not waterproof or water-resistant. I wore it in the rain once and the water soaked right through the outer shell. Still not a problem for me though!

Even better in person, but if you want a really good description of this hoody, watch the video they included among the product pictures. I immediately thought that he was saying all that I was thinking, lol.I have this in size 3XL, and it is pretty accurate to the measurements listed. Generous, American sizing. I went ahead and took my own rough measurements. Slightly more roomy with my measurements. The material has some stretch, which can be nice for creating a more fit look while still feeling casual and comfy.--Shoulder width, measured shoulder hem to shoulder hem: 26""--Width, measured arm pit to arm pit: 27.5 (so 55"" around)--Width measured at hips: 26"" (so 52"" around)--Arm length, measured from shoulder hem to arm opening, 30""--Back length measured from neck line to bottom edge: 31""The outer material is smooth. This helps repel water and to also repel debris, fur, and hair. I rarely pick up any dog or cat fur, but when I do it is very easy to just swipe it away with my hand. The interior is a short dense fluff material. This lines the entire inside (body, arms, hood). This will keep you warm, and the overall density will keep wind from seeping in. Also, the ribbed stretchy arms holes and hips also help keep out cold and wind.A side hand pocket on each side. Smooth liner material (not the fluffy stuff). Not real deep. I\'d say wrist depth. Can fit a phone, but I would be mindful of it being there as the depth may not be secure feeling enough.While I think anyone could wear it, it definitely has a more boxy manly look to it.

This jacket fit perfectly, but the sleeves and overall length were just a little bit longer than a competitor. I honestly would have kept this jacket if I had not tried the competitor\'s, because the extra length was negligible and comfortable. Generally speaking, this jacket style runs a little long in the sleeves for people like me with short arms. Then, if you buy a size extra-small (usually not available), it\'s too tight or too short in the overall length. This is a nice, well-constructed, lightweight jacket that feels warm. It\'s much lighter than a parka but it seems like it will work for cold and wet weather around 40-45 F. The hood also fits well without a hat and it seems like a very functional go-to jacket for cold rainy weather.

I wondered whether this thing would provide enough warmth in expected temperatures hovering at, or below, the freezing mark.Well, the answer turned out to be a resounding ""yes"". It did. This was the surprise, for as lightweight as this jacket was, for temps say in the 40\'s, this jacket and a single shirt underneath were sufficient. As the temperature dropped below freezing, I added thermal underwear and/or a fleece overshirt (depending on how long I was going to be outside) and - remarkably - the layers with the jacket kept me warm.And I\'m from Florida!I guess it\'s true: Air really is the best insulator. Because that\'s the principle behind this thing.As for being ""water resistant""... exceeded expectations again. I found myself in several snowfalls hovering right around the freezing mark temperature-wise. This meant that most of the flakes ended up melting right on the jacket. True, it was somewhat damp by the time I got back to my hotel, but it was dry by morning just by hanging it in the closet.For something like $35 (on sale in late 2023) I feel I really got my money\'s worth with this little puffer!P.S.

It looks very black in the photo but it\'s not a true black. It\'s more of a charcoal gray/slight navy. It doesn\'t bother me but if you are hoping for black, this is not. And the zipper. It\'s very cheap. I could not get it zipped up. I was afraid the little bottom piece would pull away from the fabric. I was very gentle with it but could not get it zipped up while I was wearing it. I had to take it off and lay it face up on my bed and work with it. I finally got it to zip and then zipped it up and down a million times to ""break it in"" but still could not get it re-zipped once I unzipped it again. Bad quality zipper which surprises me coming from a Columbia jacket. Other than these 3 things, it\'s a nice jacket.

Because of a bunion on my right foot, I do need a wider shoe but I’ve learned that most wides aren’t truly wide and I sometimes have to buy a men’s size. Not so with these! Although I did swap out the insole with the inserts I wear in my workout shoes for more arch support, these shoes needed no break-in time in Europe. The very first day we were walking in snow in Prague and over the course of 10 days, I walked an average of 6 miles a day in snowy, icy cities. The shoes felt like I had been wearing them for months already. No blisters, no red spots from rubbing, just a really comfortable shoe that kept my feet dry and warm.

I’ve worn them twice so far while running errands to see how they feel and I have to say, no discomfort and so lightweight!!Now down to sizing: With stylish boots, I’m typically a size 8, and I did order an 8 initially, however with a thin sock, they felt pretty snug and I thought maybe they might start to bother my toes since there’s more cushion that what I’m used to and what if I want to wear thick socks?For me that was enough to go up to an 8.5 juuuust to be on the safe side and because…why not find out? $75 is still $75.So glad I did!

I have a hard enough time getting the right size without this much of a difference thrown at me too!I was in love @first glance, beautiful dark gray with aqua strings. Ordered size 7 as suggested though I wear a size 6.5 or 6. Feet measures a size 5-5.5, L=8.5"" R=8.7"". There lies the rub, right foot doesn\'t fit sizes same as left one by a fraction so hit or miss. Also, remember, as you age, your feet spread causing sizing up like me to 6.5 in shoes, 7 usually in boots but style can put you back to regular size if they are rounded toe box or squared box mostly in western styles. Shoes strings are very helpful as they can be adjusted to make more room, not more length. Mules are easier to get by smaller sized if you don\'t have toes that won\'t go entire way down, heel hangs off, usually good bet as mostly open. Overall best choice in any type of foot covering is ""Leather"", your friend for stretching if little small as they will mold to feet, put in a cushion before wearing though. Zippers are the bomb for higher topped boots/shoes especially with fat feet, high instep, opens the slimmer top for feet to get to sole.Back to the size sessions; First was great price on 7\'s, looked order back up and saw where I had ordered from the warehouse! Wow, what a great mistake... for my sis! Really, check it out. What others say about buying ""like new"", warehouse, etc., if you don\'t check it out, you are making HUGE mistake. I would never had known if not curious then found sticker where stated, ""checked by warehouse"". Besides, if you don\'t like what you receive, give them to your sis for Christmas! If that\'s not acceptable, check returns, usually can send back w/30 days from Amazon, look at rules though. Truly, you need to check the other items like ones we sometimes just look at and Nope, return. Perfect shape, they get sold cheaper w/new ones @less cost.Wanted those boots but those 7\'s were too great price, that\'s why sis got them and was gaga over them. So, I ordered size 6, suggested 6.5, too bad, too big but kept just in case.... the size 5\'s I was ordering now, 3rd try, didn\'t fit even though suggested I wear a 6 now! Well the 5\'s came and went, that fraction of inch on R foot, felt fine, but only for few minutes, just fraction too small in toes based on R foot!Last and 4th time! Wow! That tells you how badly I wanted these shoes, they just checked off too many boxes to let them go without a good fight. The 5.5\'s I was sure would fit in a WIDE, had been costly, at over $100 if remember correctly. Figures! Only size left & at most expensive price! Waited a day later, 5.5W\'s & more sizes had come in, ordered them up and got them in about a day. When I saw them, crossed fingers as I thought they were a yes. I have them on now, they feel like they should have been on my feet the whole time! So, the size 5.5W is my size w/just enough room for thick socks or thinner ones. I live in Florida, though kids live in Denver & Boise & France. These will work out fine for all places as it is warm today here & fit & feel great!Updated: 12/1/23, getting later, quicker! After size 7, 6, 5, 5.5W and guess what? Another size 6 was ordered at new price 1/2 of all others, came few days later. Probably wondering what was wrong w/1st size 6\'s? Nothing, just needed to make sure of correct size due to computer blindness, too much shopping. I was getting goofy and thought perhaps all in my head, being too careful. What actually happened was I realized when I put those 5\'s on, I\'d be needing really thick, wool socks and they would be more conducive & warmer to wear in a size 6!!!! Ran to Ross, bought thick wool socks, 2 pairs, eh cheap try. I have finally found my problem, I am a Floridian going to frozen U.S. This past Thursday it was really cold here and even wearing great boots w/socks feet were freezing in few minutes on way to HOA meeting! Thank goodness I used my ""prior northern snow experience"" to kick me in head, loosen up screws and I now firmly believe that I had probably needed to size down one size smaller than the size 7 suggested to the size 6 (I got twice!) or try a wide in next small size if all left. I know I really needed the room, which these boots have plenty of and are warm whereas my Frye\'s were made for Florida & no thick socks! The only dilemma w/sizing is the extra room throughout/around entire toe bed & instep w/room to spare, it\'s the length to think about, like I finally did. I also put in a shoe cushion to help with some of the extra room, then thick socks won over. Still have plenty of room through toe bed area but TOO PRETTY, COMFY & TIRED to second guess anymore, size 6 it is!Merry Christmas Folks! Good Luck with your sizing, hope this finally solves some problems??? It was the socks that made all the difference which I kept hearing in almost every review but didn\'t hear the bell in head go off... All\'s good that ends with most comfortable boot for warm & still is especially fab for cold, wet wool sock weather! I can go snow boarding now!

I will of course wear them with the orthotics otherwise my plantar fasciitis will get inflamed. I want to wear one pair at work which is standing on my feet my entire shift on cement floors and the other for daily use or camping etc. I will also be spraying a treatment on them for additional protection against the elements.I do have wide feet. One being bigger and slightly wider than the other as well. I always wore a 6.5 shoe, but I guess my feet spread out over time so now I wear 7.5-8 shoes/boots. I went with the 7.5 wide on these and they feel just fine. If I got 8s I think they’d have been too long and I’d be tripping on my own feet. Definitely glad I got the wides they would have been too narrow if I got the regular ones. The orthotics raise my foot in the shoe so I have to loosen the laces a lot to accommodate and this is the first time I’ve had extra length on the laces to tie rather than a teeny amount to tie my shoes!For today I am wearing these around the house to break them in. They feel fine out of the box but I tend to get foot fatigue easily due to my foot condition so I need to break them in. My baby toes always get the brunt of the pain when wearing shoes and especially new shoes. I haven’t felt that pain right away like I normally would.

Caudill', 'rating': 4, 'content': ""I got this to directly compare to the infamous but very expensive baerskin.Pros: As far as weight, it's close but very slightly lighter. The fleece is slightly different but still very soft. Has a lot of pockets but the internal ones do not zip. Still have internal side pockets. And the exterior pockets are massive; much bigger in comparison to BS. And it also has rear pockets (BS calls it a map pocket). It's hood is good and has the little bill. Also, it has thumb holes where BS does not (if you're into that). They are small and kinda dig into your thumbs. The waistline does adjust to prevent airflow.Cons: The zipper is on the wrong side and does not zip as smoothly as its expensive competitor. Thumb holes do not equate to adjustable cuffs. The hood does NOT adjust (this is my biggest problem with the entire thing, actually). As others have said, the hood is a little big and floppy and given lack of adjustment, it's almost useless unless you want to go sailing. One last thing compared to BS, the zipper does not have the wind resistant inner flap like its competitor.Differences but but neither good/bad: It's fits different. It's not as bulky (both are mediums). This one fits tighter, but not because it's smaller, but rather because it isn't as thick.So there ya go. I suppose you're here because you're considering BS.

I knew it would be cold and would likely be raining on the hike and didn\'t want to freeze. I already had a Columbia waterproof windbreaker but wanted more warmth than a windbreaker could provide and didn\'t want to get overheated.When the jacket arrived, I was surprised by how well it fit. After reading all those reviews saying the jacket ran large, I wasn\'t sure what I\'d get. But it fit perfectly and I took it on my hike up Icehouse Canyon. We eventually encountered a cold rain as expected but the Columbia Men\'s Steens Fleece Jacket kept me warm, even though my ""waterproof"" windbreaker was completely saturated. I was very satisfied by the way it fit underneath the windbreaker (first photo).I\'ve also used this jacket for snow hikes like Mt Baden Powell (second photo) and it performed well. My only gripe with this jacket and the reason I deducted one star, is that the jacket is somewhat bulky and seems to take up the entire backpack when you\'re not wearing it.Overall, this is an excellent jacket for cool weather hikes if you don\'t mind how bulky it is.NOTE: For whatever reason, Amazon decided to strip out the two photos I had included in my review showing the Columbia Fleece jacket in use on rain and snow hikes.

As the name suggests, the jacket is very much capable of keeping you dry on a rainy day; however, its value goes way beyond a rain coat. Here are several features that make this jacket a wonderful addition to your wardrobe.Waterproof and WindproofThis jacket is truly waterproof. It helps you stay clean and dry even in the pouring rain. With the waterproof technology comes the wonderful stain repellent feature. No matter how dirty the jacket gets during a rainy day, a simple wipe is enough to take care of it. The windproof feature provides an extra protection against the cold. Meanwhile, the fabric is still breathable that it allows moisture vapor to move away from the skin. The only downside is that the waterproof feature can post difficulty when it comes to washing this jacket. You may find a pouch of water when you take it out of the washer. An extra cycle of drying will take care of the issue if this ever occurs.DesignThis jacket is lined with a soft layer of mesh and is very light weight. The longer arm length and body length provide enough coverage to keep you dry no matter how hard the wind is blowing. The hood comes out far enough forward to shield your face while the drawstring helps keep the hood on even in strong wind. Two front pockets with zipper are big enough to protect a phone, a wallet, a set of keys, and even a pair of gloves from getting rained on. The slim design delivers a more modern look than its competitors, helping you keep the style even on an awfully crummy day. Meanwhile, the jacket is still generous with space around your chest so that you always have enough room for a sweater or a hoodie or even a coat. Another notable feature is that the entire jacket can be packed into the front left pocket, which comes with a double-sided zipper.VersatilityFew jackets are as versatile as this one. The waterproof and windproof features make this jacket practically perfect for a fishing trip. The breathable fabric makes sure that you can throw this jacket over your favorite tee on a rainy day in the middle of the summer. You can also layer up under this jacket for fall or winter use. The matt finish and the slick look ensure that no one knows you are using a rain jacket as a spring/fall windbreaker. You can also use this jacket to protect your pea coat from getting wet on a snow day.Overall, the Columbia Men’s Watertight Rain Jacket is a high quality jacket that can be worn in many occasions. It surely has room for improvements. But for the price you are paying, you can hardly find a better deal than this.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 16, 2016', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Greqlat quality wind breaker.', 'author': 'Saqib', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Perfect fit, good for rain and wind breaker.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States November 23, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Good fit, quality', 'author': 'Kindle Customer', 'rating': 4, 'content': ""I've ordered rain gear before on Amazon, and I've always been disappointed with the cheap plastic feel of the off-brands.

I needed a nice, heavy winter jacket for the cold and windy coastal Santa Cruz weather after moving to college, so I wanted something that would keep me warm but also look cute. This jacket is exactly what I wanted. I get compliments almost every time I wear it and now all my friends want one!Pricing:I don’t usually spend more than $30 on clothing, but I really wanted this jacket, so I decided to splurge a little. Plus, Carhartt is a reliable brand, so I know it will last me a very long time. I looked into a few other brands (Dickies, Patagonia, etc.), but I felt that Carhartt was a better fit for what I was looking for. I considered getting a jacket from Dickies ($139.99) that was close to identical, but I decided to go with Carhartt ($109) because not only was it more cost-efficient, but it seemed warmer and more stylish as well.Pros:The jacket is nice and warm without being too heavy and goes with almost any outfit. I also love that Carhartt tends to look even better with a little wear and tear over time, unlike some other brands. This way I don’t have to treat it like a new pair of white shoes and be worried about getting a little scuff or dirt on it. It is extremely durable, so if that’s what you’re looking for, look no further!Potential Cons:You should be aware that when you first get the jacket it may feel bulky and tough, but it is easy to break in. I washed it a couple of times according to the instructions on the tag and it is much better now. It was a bit big on me (as I was expecting), so I threw it in the dryer after I washed it and it did shrink a little bit, but definitely not too much. For reference, I am 5’2 and 110 lbs and I got the mens small. It is still a little big on me even after shrinking it, but that’s exactly what I was aiming for. The zipper can be a little sticky at times, but it hasn’t been a big issue for me so far. One thing you should know is that it is not waterproof or water-resistant. I wore it in the rain once and the water soaked right through the outer shell. Still not a problem for me though! Just thought I’d mention it.Overall:Overall it's an amazing jacket and is one of my favorite clothing items that I own. I don’t know how I went all this time without it!

It is warm, quite warm. The exterior feels almost like canvas. Brand new, it is fairly stiff. The hood is stiff, and I had to persuade it to stay down. Again, I assume time will ease the stiffness somewhat. The interior is soft flannel. Waist and wrists have elastic to keep snow out, but they do not chafe. Overall very comfortable.

Having used it once, I am most impressed.First, some comparisons to my old jacket: both jackets are well designed. Seams are all straight and tight. Its length (I was a bit concerned about this as the seller did not provide dimension information) is perfect hanging just below the hips. While my old jacket had velcro wrist bands, the new one improves on how they are used and avoids inner materials from bunching.The jacket has an internal set of snaps with a snow band to keep warm air inside the chest area and snow out when in deep snow or when one falls. The design allows for a loose or tube fit or a way to have a form fitting wear. I also noted that this new jacket is noticeably lighter than my old oneThe materials and design allow for heat retention, even in windy conditions, probably down to the sub teens and significant wind.My old jacket pre-dates smart phones and electronically sensitive ski passes. The new one has all the pockets I need to store phones, passes, ear buds, gloves and other items and still look good.Given the price point, I am not taking off any stars for zippers. However, if the seller wants to improve this jacket that is where I would put a few extra bucks: better quality of zipper and a two way front panel zipper.Hope you all enjoy this coat as much as I will.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 27, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Nice', 'author': 'Robert Wayne Kifer', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'It keep me warm in this winter weather like none of my other winter coats did.

A. Jacques', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I have been looking for a good spring\\fall jacket like this one for a long time. I had one years ago and my son borrowed it and of course left it somewhere and I have been on a search for a replacement ever since. I have purchased at least three replacement and none of them had the qualities I was looking for similar to my old one - comfortable fit, wrinkle resistant, wind resistant and easy to clean. This jacket has all that and more.I ended up purchasing two jackets that seemed to fit the bill, this one and the London Fog Men's Auburn Zip Front Mesh Lined Golf Jacket. I could not decide between the two so I got them both and ended up sending back the London Fog. So this is somewhat a comparison review between the two.The London Fog had a few nice features I liked over this one, the sleeves were a bit longer and did not have cuffs, and the pockets had a zippered pocket next to a regular open pocket which I thought was pretty slick. Plus the front zipper was hidden which gave it a nice look. But it was a bit short and the mesh lining did not feel good against the skin. The main reason I went with this jacket though was the microfiber material. It came out of the shipping bag with virtually no wrinkles and what it did have disappeared in minutes after unpacking. The London Fog in no way could compare when it comes to being wrinkle free and that is what I liked most about my old jacket. You can wad this jacket into a ball and tuck it in a drawer for a day, pull it out, give it a shake and you're ready to go. It's that wrinkle resistant. The lining on this jacket is much more comfortable against the skin too. Very comfy to wear even when driving.At first I did not think I would like the stretch style cuffs and waist band, but now that I have worn it for a bit I like it a lot. I carry a concealed weapon and it helps hide any bulges nicely. I also wear a lot of shirts that do not tuck so when I go out I curl them up under the waist band until I get where I'm going. It works out well.The jacket is perfect for cool mornings when I walk into work from our company parking structure where it can get pretty cool. Even when it's 70+ degrees it's not too uncomfortable to put on for the walk back to the car after work. It keeps you pretty warm down to the mid 40's no problem. It breaks the wind well and while it's not waterproof it does the job when there is a light rain and dries quickly afterwards. I keep it in the back seat of my car so it's there when needed. You could easily use it as a golf jacket, but I don't since the sleeves are a wee bit short for that. Not to short for normal wear but to swing a golf club it would feel restrictive. But I have very long arms so it's common for me to deal with this problem, if you have more normal length arms, it would work well for this too.I like it so much I plan to get a second one of a different color. I have had more than one person comment on how nice a jacket it is so there is that. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a stylish, practical spring/fall jacket.

My sample arrived just as the temperature took a dive and while it kept some of the cold out, it was no match for the El Nino induced cold front.

I wanted a sweatshirt I could launder at least 15 times before it became too worn out looking to try to wear at a social event. Even after the appearance degraded, I still wanted the sweatshirt to remain warm, comfy, and in tact so I could wear it while lounging inside my home or during other situations that didn\'t require me to look quite as put together.I\'m a female, 5\'6 tall, about 115 lbs, 32C bra size, 26 inch waist, and 36.5 inch hips. I have slightly broader shoulders and a slightly longer torso than the average female of my size. I have a slender build.I wanted one sweatshirt to fit pretty loose (for layering and comfort) and another to have a trendy oversized looked.I definitely should have bought larger sizes, and I don\'t think these sweatshirts will hold up the way I had hoped.MAIN THOUGHTS: Overall quality is ""barely okay."" (I guess it really depends on how you intend to use this sweatshirt and the pricing. You may find the quality to be acceptable... or very disappointing.) Shrinks a lot after just one wash - almost by a size and a half. Shrinkage is more drastic in the length of the body and sleeves, but also affects the width. Overall, does not launder well under ""normal conditions."" You may have to be very careful to avoid any heat or abrasiveness to keep this sweatshirt looking its best for as long as possible. (Not worth the effort, IMO.) Stains show easily on this particular color and are surprisingly difficult to remove. Possible dye issues. The large sweatshirt came out with what appears to be bleached/faded spots on the bottom banding. (We don\'t use bleach or a lot of harsh chemicals in my home due to allergies and skin sensitivity issues. So, I\'m not sure how this occured. No other clothing item came out of the laundry with the same problem.) Already noticed some slight pilling in spots. Barely noticeable now, but this is only after one laundry session. Sweatshirts aren\'t very warm, but they are comfortable (as long as you get the correct size).If you choose to buy this sweatshirt, I\'d recommend you buy 1-2 sizes larger to account for shrinkage and to allow for layering. If you only plan to wear a thin tank top underneath, you probably don\'t need to size up too much. But if you plan to wear a long sleeve thermal underneath and still want a loose fit, I\'d go up 2 sizes.MORE SPECIFIC DETAILS: This sweatshirt is between light-weight and mid-weight thickness. It\'s more suitable to wear during chilly/cooler days in the Fall or Spring. It\'s not enough to keep someone warm during very cold Winter weather without adding several layers underneath and on top.I wore both sweatshirts twice before washing them. Once with only a tank top underneath, and once with a thin long sleeve thermal underneath. Then I machine washed them in semi-warm water and dried them on medium heat (being careful not to leave them in the dryer more than necessary).BEFORE LAUNDERING: Both sweatshirts felt slightly rough (nothing really bothersome or too noticeable) and disappointingly thin. The color was as expected - a lovely muted, pale green. One sweatshirt arrived with excess threads hanging from the bottom. But I was able to safely cut them off without risk of anything unraveling. I liked the way both tops fit and draped. The sizes were as I hoped they would be. I accidentally spilled a cold, milky coffee drink on the smaller sweatshirt. I treated it with a pre-wash stain remover. Then threw both sweatshirts in the washer with a pair of jeans and no-lint sports towel (all similar colors as the sweatshirts).AFTER LAUNDERING: Both tops became softer and slightly fluffier after washing. This made them feel a bit thicker and warmer. Both were noticably smaller, though. The large top now fits similar to the way the medium used to fit. Except it\'s a tad bit shorter. Both tops no longer drape the way they did before I washed them. It\'s not a huge issue for me, though. The banding on both tops also shrank a bit. I no longer like the way the medium fits me. Prior to washing, the end of the sleeves reached halfway down my fingers. The sleeve cuffs were loose enough that I could have them drape that way, but just snug enough that I could pull them back around my wrists. Now the wrist cuffs sit snuggly around my wrists. When I reach for items above my head, the sleeves pull back a bit, exposing more of my wrists... and the waist hem rides up so that I have to yank it down when I drop my arms back down to my sides. (That\'s how badly the top shrank in length after just one wash!) The brown color from where I spilled my coffee on the medium top was gone, but there\'s still a visible stain. It just looks a couple shades darker than the sweatshirt color... like I spilled water on myself and it\'s starting to dry a bit. (I\'m going to try a different stain remover and wash it again. Hopefully it works, otherwise this top will permanently look dirty.) As I already mentioned, the larger top had some pale pumkin-yellow spots on the lower banding - similar to what bleach spots would look like. I\'m okay with the fit of the larger size sweatshirt even after it shrank. So, it\'s a shame that the color bled the way it did.Overall, I\'m disappointed with my purchases. These are already going to be dedicated lounging and housework shirts. They are a bit warmer and very soft inside, which is nice. And nothing has unraveled, so it seems the stitching is good. I don\'t think these would be great for screen-printing, simply because of the amount of shrinkage and the fact that they\'re already showing signs of pilling in areas that don\'t get much friction.Hope this info helps. If anything, these aren\'t bad sweatshirts to have on hand to adapt to temperature fluctuations. They\'re stretchy, so they\'re easy to quickly throw on as an extra layer and take off as needed. Just be mindful they leave some lint behind on 100% cotton shirts. The lint problem will probably diminish after a few washes, though.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 11, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Nice, casual, medium weight sweatshirt.', 'author': 'N.

So this year as fall hit, I was looking for a ~200$ HH or Kuhl lightly insulated jacket but I had no luck finding anything I liked in an LT size. After hours of comparison shopping I found this one on Amazon. It was priced lower than I preferred as I wanted a business casual coat that I would feel good wearing at the office and I wanted something that looked expensive. I have never heard of Weatherproof but they trumpet their \'since 1949\'. Strangely for a company so proud of the brand they didn\'t have a single logo anywhere visible on the outside of the coat, just the tags inside the coat. OK - whatever. The coat itself fits absolutely perfectly and looks great. The first order was hilarious as I am an LT and Amazon sent me a 4XLT so when I put it on I looked like I was in a tent. Amazon issue not the coats - and amazon processed the return and had me a replacement in 3 days so it was all good. So I am 6\'4\' 230 with broad shoulders, long arms. 36\' waist. This LT size is form fit for those dimensions. I typically have trouble with too short arms and too short a waist and occasionally too big a waist on the coat. This coat had none of these issues and just fits. All zippers work and the seams are well sown. Velcro sleeves aren\'t too bulky. I like the material for the outside and it just feels sturdy. The insulation was much better than expected and I wore it in 35F weather this week and while I won\'t say I was toasty I was OK. I would want to ""layer up"" colder than 35F for sure. The wife says it looks slimming and I feel good wearing it. So I feel like I met my goals of expensive look and feel, perfect fit, (bonus - decent insulation without bulk). I did not get any of the brand names I was after but I paid less than 1/2 my budget so I\'ll get over it. Highly recommended - I would get another in a heartbeat.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States November 2, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great Quality Jacket!', 'author': 'RedShiftRider', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'This ended up being exactly what I was hoping for!Quality is great. The fit is perfect too. I bought a medium and it fits perfectly. It’s a mid-weight jacket just as the description states. Perfect for a fall/spring weather outer layer. Though it is warm enough to be paired with a hoodie underneath and used during the winter. The inside is fleece lined and soft. The exterior is a nylon type water resistant material. Really nice quality and gives the jacket a very clean and crisp look. Which means it’s also a great option for more formal situations as well. It’s a great all-rounder.This will be my new go-to for any situation that doesn’t require a full on bulky winter coat. I’ll most likely reach for this during the winter when heading to work as well. It’s warm enough for short walks to and from the car. I can’t think of any reasons I wouldn’t wear this, other than needing a hood, or when I need a full-on winter coat. New #1 coat.The only criticism I could offer is that it did take a full 2 weeks to receive mine. My order wasn’t processed and shipped for probably 3-4 days after I ordered. Then it took another 2-3 to arrive, only to find out they sent me a small. I exchanged it for a medium no problem, but that order took another 4-5 days to ship out, and another 3-4 to arrive. Finally received the correct medium exactly 2 weeks after ordering. Both items shipped USPS which probably didn’t help anything. A little frustrating when you’re used to 2 day shipping on everything.

It's warm enough to wear in the middle of winter with just a long sleeve t-shirt underneath but I can also wear it during the spring or fall and not get too hot. It's very well made and holds up to wind and rain. I love all the pockets that zip up and have tons of room for gloves, keys, plus my cellphone fits perfectly in the chest pocket and the hidden inside pockets are also fantastic for some extra things if you need the room. The only reason I got a 2nd jacket was the zipper on my first one started to fray at the bottom from constant use throughout the cold months plus I've put it through the wash a few times and when I tried to have the zipper replaced the local tailors here in Manhattan wanted to charge me more than the cost of a brand new coat so sadly I just decided to buy a new one but otherwise my original coat was still in perfect condition except for the front zipper....but a coat like this that holds up perfectly for 8 years is an AMAZING VALUE so I was totally happy to buy a 2nd one and I would buy it again in the future if I need to.

It's not too tight, but it's not overly baggy either. The quality of the materials used is evident as soon as you put it on. The seams are well-stitched, and the overall construction is solid, promising durability.The standout feature of this jacket is its remarkable softness. It feels incredibly gentle against the skin, making it a pleasure to wear for extended periods. Moreover, it's exceptionally warm, making it an ideal choice for chilly weather. I've worn it on brisk fall days, and it kept me toasty throughout.In summary, the Amazon Essentials Men's Long-Sleeve Polar Fleece Shirt Jacket is a fantastic addition to any wardrobe.

I already have a bunch of fleece jackets, some pull overs, and this one just seemed a little less sexy than most of the others that I have. So I gave this to my wife, and she wore it once or twice, but it was too big for her.One day for no particular reason I started wearing this again and I noticed after a day or two that it was extremely comfortable. It’s nice that you can button it up when you’re cold and unbutton it as it gets warmer. The side pockets are really hefty and you can stick your phone in there and other stuff. The “build quality “ on this is impressive. The material is just the right thickness. It’s a little too heavy to be called a shirt, I would call it a light jacket. I wear it mostly indoors, this would not be warm enough on a cold Colorado day outside. You could maybe run to get the mail but that’s about it.Anyway, I fell in love with it and I’ve basically worn it consistently during the winter of 22/23. It dawned on me the other day that I like this so much , that I really should buy another. Amazon was still selling them, and the price was so incredible, I went ahead and bought one in several different colors. So I think I have a total of six of these now. For the price these just can’t be beat. I’m 6‘4“and about 240 pounds and the double XL fits nicely.

Consider sizing up if you have a large belly.', 'author': 'Junie B', 'rating': 4, 'content': ""I purchased the light gray Amazon Essentials Men's Long-Sleeve Polar Fleece shirt/jacket in size medium and have worn it as a jacket several times since 12/24/23. I 'm a 138 lb., 5' & 1.5” tall, 38C bra female with slender arms and excess stomach weight. Obviously, this masculine shirt/jacket is long on me (comes just to the bottom of my seat when unbuttoned) and has arms that are too wide for me, but I like it anyway. In chilly days in the South, it provides good warmth as a jacket. Made in Vietnam, it's clearly a quality garment, with neat stitching, buttonholes that line up perfectly with the buttons, a wider collar that can be positioned upward, inside pockets that are 9.5 inches deep and 5.5 inches wide, and firmer outside pockets (which functionally are not as deep because of the angle of the opening). This soft fleece shirt/jacket is comfortable. The buttonholes are a little tight, but that is better than buttons being too loose to remain fastened. There is a spare button adhered to the inside left tag. This shirt/jacket has more of a straight cut which means that someone with a large belly would probably need to size up if planning to wear it buttoned. Of100% polyester, this shirt/jacket has a side tag indicating the garment should not be dry cleaned, but can be machine washed inside-out, using cold water and a gentle cycle, and machine-dried on a gentle cycle. After washing I plan to put it in the dryer for just a few minutes, and then hang to dry, as I do with most of my clothes. An update will be provided if any problems occur after washing it.I’d previously bought this shirt/jacket in dark green as a gift, but after seeing its quality, purchased the light gray for myself. The dark green color is similar to, but actually lighter than the illustration. The illustration for the light gray shirt/jacket, however, is representative of its actual color. I like the jacket so much that I just purchased a 3rd one in the indigo blue heather color. It is reported to be darker than the light blue denim color illustration. This Amazon Essentials garment is well-made and is a good value.02/12/24 Update: Subsequently purchased a shirt/jacket in Medium in blue heather. The lower stomach area is narrower than that of both the green and light grey ones. The label was checked but reflected medium- the same size as the 2 previously purchased. Whether just an anomaly for this particular jacket or all are smaller in blue heather isn't known. I can't close the bottom 2 buttons on this one but can on both the green and the light gray, both of which fall straight (no gap) after having been buttoned.

Does not have a hood on it, which I didn\'t pay attention to but he does like a hood on it. But overall it was made good, like I said earlier it does run small, so I would size up.

Although I did swap out the insole with the inserts I wear in my workout shoes for more arch support, these shoes needed no break-in time in Europe.

The shoes felt like I had been wearing them for months already. No blisters, no red spots from rubbing, just a really comfortable shoe that kept my feet dry and warm. I’m so excited about these that, even though these were on sale, I’m going to buy a second pair in another color at full price. I’m very impressed.Oh, and extra points for the quick lace up option at the top.

I felt like a fool for never connecting the dots. Lol.Well…I found these, loved the color options and the reviews seemed pretty legit! I’ve worn them twice so far while running errands to see how they feel and I have to say, no discomfort and so lightweight!!Now down to sizing: With stylish boots, I’m typically a size 8, and I did order an 8 initially, however with a thin sock, they felt pretty snug and I thought maybe they might start to bother my toes since there’s more cushion that what I’m used to and what if I want to wear thick socks?For me that was enough to go up to an 8.5 juuuust to be on the safe side and because…why not find out? $75 is still $75.So glad I did! They feel roomier yet still a great fit, so if you’re in limbo, I’d say size up .5 if you want to be able to throw these on without switching your socks. 😉Happy I got these and I’m looking forward being more active!', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 24, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': ""5.0 out of 5 stars 3rd Time WAS a Charm! Only took 5 tries to find Prince Charming's Boot!"", 'author': 'FLGulfGrnEz', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I read the reviews wherever I could find them. I had become very confused over the sizing. I have a hard enough time getting the right size without this much of a difference thrown at me too!I was in love @first glance, beautiful dark gray with aqua strings. Ordered size 7 as suggested though I wear a size 6.5 or 6. Feet measures a size 5-5.5, L=8.5"" R=8.7"". There lies the rub, right foot doesn\'t fit sizes same as left one by a fraction so hit or miss. Also, remember, as you age, your feet spread causing sizing up like me to 6.5 in shoes, 7 usually in boots but style can put you back to regular size if they are rounded toe box or squared box mostly in western styles. Shoes strings are very helpful as they can be adjusted to make more room, not more length. Mules are easier to get by smaller sized if you don\'t have toes that won\'t go entire way down, heel hangs off, usually good bet as mostly open. Overall best choice in any type of foot covering is ""Leather"", your friend for stretching if little small as they will mold to feet, put in a cushion before wearing though. Zippers are the bomb for higher topped boots/shoes especially with fat feet, high instep, opens the slimmer top for feet to get to sole.Back to the size sessions; First was great price on 7\'s, looked order back up and saw where I had ordered from the warehouse! Wow, what a great mistake... for my sis! Really, check it out. What others say about buying ""like new"", warehouse, etc., if you don\'t check it out, you are making HUGE mistake. I would never had known if not curious then found sticker where stated, ""checked by warehouse"". Besides, if you don\'t like what you receive, give them to your sis for Christmas! If that\'s not acceptable, check returns, usually can send back w/30 days from Amazon, look at rules though. Truly, you need to check the other items like ones we sometimes just look at and Nope, return. Perfect shape, they get sold cheaper w/new ones @less cost.Wanted those boots but those 7\'s were too great price, that\'s why sis got them and was gaga over them. So, I ordered size 6, suggested 6.5, too bad, too big but kept just in case.... the size 5\'s I was ordering now, 3rd try, didn\'t fit even though suggested I wear a 6 now! Well the 5\'s came and went, that fraction of inch on R foot, felt fine, but only for few minutes, just fraction too small in toes based on R foot!Last and 4th time! Wow! That tells you how badly I wanted these shoes, they just checked off too many boxes to let them go without a good fight. The 5.5\'s I was sure would fit in a WIDE, had been costly, at over $100 if remember correctly. Figures! Only size left & at most expensive price! Waited a day later, 5.5W\'s & more sizes had come in, ordered them up and got them in about a day. When I saw them, crossed fingers as I thought they were a yes. I have them on now, they feel like they should have been on my feet the whole time! So, the size 5.5W is my size w/just enough room for thick socks or thinner ones. I live in Florida, though kids live in Denver & Boise & France. These will work out fine for all places as it is warm today here & fit & feel great!Updated: 12/1/23, getting later, quicker! After size 7, 6, 5, 5.5W and guess what? Another size 6 was ordered at new price 1/2 of all others, came few days later. Probably wondering what was wrong w/1st size 6\'s? Nothing, just needed to make sure of correct size due to computer blindness, too much shopping. I was getting goofy and thought perhaps all in my head, being too careful. What actually happened was I realized when I put those 5\'s on, I\'d be needing really thick, wool socks and they would be more conducive & warmer to wear in a size 6!!!! Ran to Ross, bought thick wool socks, 2 pairs, eh cheap try. I have finally found my problem, I am a Floridian going to frozen U.S. This past Thursday it was really cold here and even wearing great boots w/socks feet were freezing in few minutes on way to HOA meeting! Thank goodness I used my ""prior northern snow experience"" to kick me in head, loosen up screws and I now firmly believe that I had probably needed to size down one size smaller than the size 7 suggested to the size 6 (I got twice!) or try a wide in next small size if all left. I know I really needed the room, which these boots have plenty of and are warm whereas my Frye\'s were made for Florida & no thick socks! The only dilemma w/sizing is the extra room throughout/around entire toe bed & instep w/room to spare, it\'s the length to think about, like I finally did. I also put in a shoe cushion to help with some of the extra room, then thick socks won over. Still have plenty of room through toe bed area but TOO PRETTY, COMFY & TIRED to second guess anymore, size 6 it is!Merry Christmas Folks! Good Luck with your sizing, hope this finally solves some problems??? It was the socks that made all the difference which I kept hearing in almost every review but didn\'t hear the bell in head go off... All\'s good that ends with most comfortable boot for warm & still is especially fab for cold, wet wool sock weather! I can go snow boarding now! Uh Oh, gotta get lined pants, knit cap, goggles, warmer gloves, down filled vest...

I ordered a brand new pair and also went and bought the warehouse inspected used one on additional discount. The used pair is in perfect condition, not a mark or sign of wear anywhere on them. They’re just like the brand new pair. Perfect!I wear orthotics in my shoes, I tried them both with and without them to see how they feel. I will of course wear them with the orthotics otherwise my plantar fasciitis will get inflamed. I want to wear one pair at work which is standing on my feet my entire shift on cement floors and the other for daily use or camping etc. I will also be spraying a treatment on them for additional protection against the elements.I do have wide feet. One being bigger and slightly wider than the other as well. I always wore a 6.5 shoe, but I guess my feet spread out over time so now I wear 7.5-8 shoes/boots. I went with the 7.5 wide on these and they feel just fine. If I got 8s I think they’d have been too long and I’d be tripping on my own feet. Definitely glad I got the wides they would have been too narrow if I got the regular ones. The orthotics raise my foot in the shoe so I have to loosen the laces a lot to accommodate and this is the first time I’ve had extra length on the laces to tie rather than a teeny amount to tie my shoes!For today I am wearing these around the house to break them in. They feel fine out of the box but I tend to get foot fatigue easily due to my foot condition so I need to break them in. My baby toes always get the brunt of the pain when wearing shoes and especially new shoes. I haven’t felt that pain right away like I normally would. So that’s a plus for comfort!!So far I love these and so glad I bought both pairs! I love the color and the red laces. They remind me of the old hiking boots I used to see growing up, only a more comfortable updated version! The other colors look cute in the pics but I feel limited to what I can wear them with so I feel these are more neutral to the colors I tend to wear. Hopefully these last a long time. I do own other Columbia products and am usually pleased with their products, this is the first time purchasing footwear.Thank you!Edit I’ve been wearing these to work using my orthotics, standing on my feet on cement floor.

Clearly they would be much better at keeping my feet warm and dry compared to my Ugg boots. Which it is no surprise that they actually did! My feet were BONE DRY. I was out there for over an hour walking through nearly knee high snow, both shoveling/clearing off cars in my drive way. I love these shoes. Not only this but I had to go to work and play outside in the snow with my preschool kids and same thing, nice and dry. I also wore them all day, 8-5, and my feet feel great!

This jacket is worth the Amazon price, but is not worth the full retail price. Eddie Bauer does regularly offer 40% off coupons that bring the full price in line with the Amazon price. Eddie Bauer also, occasionally, has a 50% off sale which would bring the price down to $49, that would be a really good bargain.If you want a good deal, pay the Amazon price. If you are in no hurry, wait for a 50$ off sale at Eddie Bauer.Why do I think this is a good deal? This is not the best down jacket you can buy. This should really be thought of as a 'down sweater' and not a jacket. This does not have a lot of features. This has good down, but does not have the highest quality down ( 650 dfp (down fill power) vs 850 dfp or 900 dfp. This does not have down treated with a hydrophillic process to make the down more water proof. This does not have an outer shell of some super high-tech fabric like dyneema or pertex.However, this is a really good, bargain down jacket.It has quality down. when dfp ratings started being used, 400 to 500 was the most common, ordinary, jacket fill. 650 used to be considered very 'high end'. Most of the ultra-expensive coats and jackets that Canada Goose sells use 650 dfp down. Things have changed and the high end is much higher now, but 650 dfp is still good. Ask anyone who has spent over $1,000 on a Canada Goose jacket with 650 dfp down.There are better jackets that are much more expensive, but this jacket is a good jacket for $59.If the jacket had 2 of any of the following 3 features, I think it would be worth the retail price of $99:1) A hem drawstring, instead of the elastic it has.2) A zippered chest pocket (inside or outside) for a phone.3) a double zipper on one of the pockets, so the jacket can be stored in its own pocket.This jacket lacks all of those features. They are all pretty basic. If it had any 2 of those 3, I'd class it as a $99 jacket.This is not a jacket that will get you across Antartica on a dog sled, but it will meet the needs of many people out there. I've worn this jacket in weather ranging from 0º F to 45º F. Alone, it is good down to about 32º F, if it isn't freezing rain out. Below that temperature, I usually combine it with a fleece hoody underneath this jacket.It was 24ºF today on my way to work and I wore the fleece hoody/EB cirruslite down jacket combo and was pretty warm. If it is wet out, I'll wear this jacket under a waterproof shell. The coldest weather, and I combine the three layers: Fleece hoody, down sweater, gore-tex shell. That can take me down to the 0º F easily. I'll see if I can use that combo even lower this January. It just hasn't gotten that cold yet.Workmanship is fine. Remember this is a $59 dollar jacket. I found one hanging thread I cut off. It wasn't a loose thread, just extra. The first few days, a few of the very tiny down feathers came out near some seems. I have had this with every down jacket I have owned. The very smallest feathers fit through the larger sew holes. It happens, but it doesn't really leak down.To sum it up, it is worth the price charged here on Amazon. You can get jackets with more feartures, but they cost more. You can get jackets with better down, or better fabrics but you won't get them for $59.Jackets like the Montbell Alpine Lite, REI Magma 850 2.0, or Patagonia down sweater have more features, better fabric and better down. They retail for $209 to $229. You'll see extra features like zipper storm flaps, zippered chest pockets, fleece lined collars, water resistant down and more on these other jackets. Features that are not present on this jacket. They also cost from $140 to $170 more than this jacket does.This is a great bargain for the price, it can be a really good part of any layered winter system, and you can buy 3 or 4 of these for the price of a high end brand name lite down jacket.I've added pictures of the one loose thread, and one of the very small feathers that came out (the feather is so small it is hard to see).I've added pictures of how I layer the jacket with the fleece and the outer shell when needed.This is a good deal, has responsibly sourced down and is pretty well made. If you want more features, there are plenty of other down jackets with more features."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 10, 2019', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars CHAMARRA', 'author': 'Lidia', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'MUY PADRE CHAMARRA DE PLUMA LIGERA POR ALGUNAS FOTOS ME CONFUNDI PENSE QUE ERA MAS ACOLCHONADA EN REALIDAD ES PLUMA LIGERA AUN ASI ESTA DE MUY BUENA CALIDAD Y ME AGRADO', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 26, 2024', 'is_verified': True}]"

I needed a nice, heavy winter jacket for the cold and windy coastal Santa Cruz weather after moving to college, so I wanted something that would keep me warm but also look cute. This jacket is exactly what I wanted. I get compliments almost every time I wear it and now all my friends want one!Pricing:I don’t usually spend more than $30 on clothing, but I really wanted this jacket, so I decided to splurge a little. Plus, Carhartt is a reliable brand, so I know it will last me a very long time. I looked into a few other brands (Dickies, Patagonia, etc.), but I felt that Carhartt was a better fit for what I was looking for. I considered getting a jacket from Dickies ($139.99) that was close to identical, but I decided to go with Carhartt ($109) because not only was it more cost-efficient, but it seemed warmer and more stylish as well.Pros:The jacket is nice and warm without being too heavy and goes with almost any outfit. I also love that Carhartt tends to look even better with a little wear and tear over time, unlike some other brands. This way I don’t have to treat it like a new pair of white shoes and be worried about getting a little scuff or dirt on it. It is extremely durable, so if that’s what you’re looking for, look no further!Potential Cons:You should be aware that when you first get the jacket it may feel bulky and tough, but it is easy to break in. I washed it a couple of times according to the instructions on the tag and it is much better now. It was a bit big on me (as I was expecting), so I threw it in the dryer after I washed it and it did shrink a little bit, but definitely not too much. For reference, I am 5’2 and 110 lbs and I got the mens small. It is still a little big on me even after shrinking it, but that’s exactly what I was aiming for. The zipper can be a little sticky at times, but it hasn’t been a big issue for me so far. One thing you should know is that it is not waterproof or water-resistant. I wore it in the rain once and the water soaked right through the outer shell. Still not a problem for me though! Just thought I’d mention it.Overall:Overall it's an amazing jacket and is one of my favorite clothing items that I own. I don’t know how I went all this time without it!

This was a gift to my husband, as we live in the northern US where we are deep in snow. First off, this coat is a medium weight, and the inside is all soft fur. Even the hoodie is lined with fur, which worked excellent in keeping his head/neck/mouth area covered from the cold. It was roomy with a Velcro strap to keep it snug, and it is wide enough that it covers the top of the jacket when zipped. There are 3 sets of pockets: down on the side, one on the chest and one inside the jacket. This is great, as you don’t always get a secure inside pocket to tuck away your wallet, keys, money, etc. The size shown is an XX-Large and is a good length in which it would cover down beneath the bum. My husband went out to snow blow wearing a long-sleeve t-shirt and this jacket. He was surprised that it kept him warm, as we were getting snow drifts from the wind. He is pretty thin and he was surprised he didn’t get cold at all. We had a bit of rain a week later, which this jacket did great at repelling water. The cuffs on the sleeve are adjustable, and the coat also has small pull straps to tighten the hoodie around your face. This jacket will surprise you – it has the quality of a more expensive jacket but is affordable for most to buy.

The first thing I did when I opened up this jacket was run it under a faucet and make sure waterproof meant waterproof and not water resistant. I can safely say this jacket served its purpose for me more than well. In pouring, freezing rain or snow or sleet, it kept my torso completely warm and dry. It fits very well and is comfortable to wear. On days when I want it for warmth and am not concerned about the weather, I just take the hood off. All the pockets have zippers so I don't have to worry about losing anything or my items getting wet. I definitely would recommend this jacket to any other fellow ATs or people that are forced to stand outside for hours in the pouring, cold, rain."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 16, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Nearly a Perfect Jacket', 'author': 'Joseph', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'Price is great for what you get. First let me say I really like this jacket a lot. The jacket is great looking. Had lots of compliments from other men, asked me where I got it. The lining is warm and the coat is great in the rain and the length is perfect, I am 5\' 9"" 180 pounds I bought a size large, and it covers right to the bottom of my butt cheeks, keeping my butt dry and warm. I love the coat. It also has a removal zippered hood so you don\'t have to have it hanging there all the time when it\'s not need in warmer weather, etc. But, it will require two changes to the design to make this a perfect coat for me. #1 It needs some velcro closures on the zipper flaps to keep it closed. Yes there are two snaps, at the top and bottom of flaps, but if you\'re wearing gloves they are tough to deal with, and even when buttoned, snow and air could possibly sneak under the flap. Velcro would be a quick and easy way to secure the zipper flap. #2 It needs a double zipper. Because of the length of the jacket, butt cheeks covered, I have to fully unzip it when I sit down in the car, etc. I usually ""hike-it up"" and leave it zippered but it would be more comfortable if it had a double zipper which would allow me to just unzip a few inches from the bottom. It would also make it easier to get my hands into my pants pockets as well.So bottom line: If you need a warm waterproof great looking great fitting almost perfectly designed jacket, I highly recommend this one.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States November 10, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars The quality on these....waow!', 'author': 'Dwaine Burrell', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""Ok I know I didn't show much in the pics but trust me guys I'm absolutely happy with my purchase.

This is amazing for such a basic jacket, especially when SO many jackets, even of higher quality and price seem to offer only one small internal pocket, or quite often, none at all.-Perfect for warm rainy days, as it provides zero warmth and has no insulation or even lining-Very compact and portable, easily compacting into its own included small carrying bag-Intelligently designed, and the company seems to care about the functionality of its products.-A very good value/low price.-Fits true to size.What I'm not so crazy about:-It's literally a plastic sheet - thicker than your typical rain poncho, but very stiff and noisy.-Non-adjustable cuffs. The stiffness of the jacket's material makes the elastic, non-adjustable/non-tightenable cuffs fail to make a very good seal around my wrists, and I have pretty fat wrists.-Very thin and actually translucent - If you carry any dark items in the pockets, they can be seen by people (at least for this orange-red color). As I like to carry my dark wallet in the internal pockets of my jackets, it's almost advertised with the translucency of the material.-Absolutely no lining or insulation - I wish they had at least added a mesh lining or something, as the plastic material sticks to your arms if you wear short sleeves. Also, a lining would help to provide a bit of security insomuch as providing a visual barrier (see above regarding the jacket being translucent) - kind of like a security mailing envelope versus a non-security envelope.-Not necessarily a con, but the jacket provides ZERO warmth, so it's only really suitable for warmer rainy days, or to act as a hardshell jacket to go over your own layered clothing selected for colder days - again, this is not necessarily a con.This is a nice jacket overall, very basic and no-frills, with some nice extra features. I think a few minor tweaks could really make this a winning jacket.

Sipped up a little tight around my gut, but I’ve been hitting the churros kinda hard recently. Also, unless I luck out or order things custom tailored- sleeves always fit me long, as they did with this jacket. I am totally okay with it; it’s a minor thing to me given how great the rest of it fit and how much it cost. I can’t wait for the chance to wear it out. If you ride, this is probably not the jacket for you. Throw a sweater under it and it might be good in cold weather. TL;DR Outstanding jacket for the price.

I've ordered cheap jackets on Amazon before and have been completely satisfied. Unless you are looking for a disposable sports coat for a one-time event which will be held in a dark, dark room. Maybe look elsewhere.Specifics:• The collar is cut and pressed funny so it goes up high on the back of your neck. Very stiff and though it's folded down, it looks like you're flipping it up to make some kind of '80s style statement.• That white line in the pocket is not a handkerchief or a paper insert for decoration, it's sewn in and looks incredibly cheap up close. But you can fold it down to be hidden, which makes a slight lump, but better than up.• I'm pretty thin so the jacket fit well around my waist, the length was good. But the cut of the lapel was so bad that I looked like Bruce Banner in a mid-Hulk moment around the chest. The lapel does not lay naturally, it opens wide like a poorly-fitting tux coat. Even with the button undone, it flares to the side a bit and looks like it fits on the bottom but is a size too small across the chest. Strangely, the shoulders fit okay, except for...• ...the shoulder pads. Yes, thick, uneven shoulder pads. Felt strange, looked strange.• The buttons look like cheap plastic. I know for $30 they are going to be cheap plastic, but there's a difference between BEING cheap plastic and looking from 10 feet away like cheap plastic. It looks and feels like the material in a disposable plastic spoon.• Last point, but there's more: The jacket is fully lined and the lining does not look too bad, BUT when you put your arms into the sleeves, you push the lining out of the other end with your hands so you kind of have to tuck the lining back into your sleeve once you have the jacket on.I was going to return this, but for $30, it hardly seems worth the effort. I'm going to have it steamed and pressed to try to fix some of the sleeve and collar issues and am replacing the buttons with better-looking cheap plastic.One thing I do like about the jacket is the pockets in front are real and fairly large. I hate when sports coats sew the pockets shut to help the line of the jacket. Also the inside pocket, though only one, is pretty functional. The outer pocket flaps also tuck in if you like a cleaner look, so it's not all bad.If you're looking for a good alternative, it's not as low-priced, but the jackets by Ferrecci-Zonettie here on Amazon are great.UPDATE:After wearing the jacket for a few months, some of the flaws have diminished. Fabric has relaxed a bit. It still has most of the problems I mentioned above, but surprisingly, has worn fairly well. I've been rough on it, too, thinking it'd start coming apart at the seams giving me an excuse to toss it. But so far even the too-loose lining has held up to activity.

I could go up a size and improve the shoulder fit, but then I could probably smuggle two basketballs.Overall it's not bad. The look and workmanship is good.

For bike rides the cut and fit is just fine. If I wanted to tailor it a bit there are side panels that would make that easy.

Overall, it's a decent choice for a casual bomber jacket, but it does have a small snag that's worth mentioning.Let's start with the good stuff. First off, the V-shaped pattern solid jacquard design instantly caught my eye. It adds a touch of style without going overboard. Plus, the handpicked textured fabric is a win – it's comfortable and breathable, making it ideal for those in-between seasons. No sweat stains for me, thank you very much!Now, let's talk about the fit. The jacket is designed to have a loose fit, which was perfect for my taste. I appreciate its versatility. You can rock it during outdoor adventures, family gatherings, or even while just hanging out on a casual day. It's a jacket for all occasions!Unfortunately, there's a minor issue that cropped up. The zipper, my friends, is a bit finicky. It seems to get stuck quite easily. It's not a dealbreaker, but for the price, I really expected something more durable. The fact that it's made of plastic also leaves me a little uncertain about its longevity. I'm crossing my fingers that it holds up in the long run.Despite the zipper glitch, this jacket is a stylish addition to my wardrobe. The quality is generally good and the fabric has a nice soft feel to it. Just make sure to keep an eye on that zipper while zipping up. If durability is your top priority, you might want to explore other options. But if you're willing to overlook a minor flaw for the sake of style, go ahead and give the SAVKOOV Men's Loose Fit Lightweight Jacket a shot."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 23, 2023', 'is_verified': False}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Really like the design', 'author': 'Joe', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Color and style …also very comfortable.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 2, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars A GREAT JACKET', 'author': 'Ralph Lawrence', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'It is just what I was looking for!', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 22, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Not a bomber jacket, more of a sweater jacket combo', 'author': 'Calvin K Chen', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'So based on other reviews, I thought that this jacket would run small and ordered a size up in anticipation, but in actuality, for me, this jacket seems to run true to size. I normally wear a large when it comes to jackets, and this XL is actually very big/roomy - so I think it does live up to its description of ""loose fitting"" - or at the very least, it\'s not smaller than I expected.As for the jacket, it\'s more of a light jacket/sweater jacket vs. an actual bomber jacket, I think only the collar gives you any kind of impression that this is something like a bomber. I think the jacket looks pretty good, and mine has a texture to the fabric that is interesting (although gives it the more sweater feel).

I wear a men\'s large shirt and measure just over 46"" through the chest, and this item fits closely when it is zipped. I highly recommend following the size chart!2. This is not at all what I would call a ""bomber jacket"" (again, this should be obvious from the pictures). A ""zip sweater"" or even ""track jacket"" would be a more accurate description.With that said, I do like this jacket. The fit is a little tighter than I expected, but it is attractive and the quality is good. The exception to that quality is the zipper! Right out of the packaging, the zipper was difficult to use. After several uses, it seemed to loosen up a tiny bit, but it still requires a bit of wiggling when first engaging it in order to zip the jacket successfully.

That is a bit disappointing since I wanted something loose fitting, and I proably should have gone with the 3XL - but then again, I don't want a jacket with drooping shoulders as well if it's too big. Otherwise, it looks ok as a regular fit jacket.Otherwise, it looks good and textured very much as the description, but just think of these sizes as Asian sizes and you should probably go bigger.

Although I did swap out the insole with the inserts I wear in my workout shoes for more arch support, these shoes needed no break-in time in Europe. The very first day we were walking in snow in Prague and over the course of 10 days, I walked an average of 6 miles a day in snowy, icy cities. The shoes felt like I had been wearing them for months already. No blisters, no red spots from rubbing, just a really comfortable shoe that kept my feet dry and warm.

I’ve worn them twice so far while running errands to see how they feel and I have to say, no discomfort and so lightweight!!Now down to sizing: With stylish boots, I’m typically a size 8, and I did order an 8 initially, however with a thin sock, they felt pretty snug and I thought maybe they might start to bother my toes since there’s more cushion that what I’m used to and what if I want to wear thick socks?For me that was enough to go up to an 8.5 juuuust to be on the safe side and because…why not find out? $75 is still $75.So glad I did!

Only took 5 tries to find Prince Charming's Boot!"", 'author': 'FLGulfGrnEz', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I read the reviews wherever I could find them. I had become very confused over the sizing. I have a hard enough time getting the right size without this much of a difference thrown at me too!I was in love @first glance, beautiful dark gray with aqua strings. Ordered size 7 as suggested though I wear a size 6.5 or 6. Feet measures a size 5-5.5, L=8.5"" R=8.7"". There lies the rub, right foot doesn\'t fit sizes same as left one by a fraction so hit or miss. Also, remember, as you age, your feet spread causing sizing up like me to 6.5 in shoes, 7 usually in boots but style can put you back to regular size if they are rounded toe box or squared box mostly in western styles. Shoes strings are very helpful as they can be adjusted to make more room, not more length. Mules are easier to get by smaller sized if you don\'t have toes that won\'t go entire way down, heel hangs off, usually good bet as mostly open. Overall best choice in any type of foot covering is ""Leather"", your friend for stretching if little small as they will mold to feet, put in a cushion before wearing though. Zippers are the bomb for higher topped boots/shoes especially with fat feet, high instep, opens the slimmer top for feet to get to sole.Back to the size sessions; First was great price on 7\'s, looked order back up and saw where I had ordered from the warehouse! Wow, what a great mistake... for my sis! Really, check it out. What others say about buying ""like new"", warehouse, etc., if you don\'t check it out, you are making HUGE mistake. I would never had known if not curious then found sticker where stated, ""checked by warehouse"". Besides, if you don\'t like what you receive, give them to your sis for Christmas! If that\'s not acceptable, check returns, usually can send back w/30 days from Amazon, look at rules though. Truly, you need to check the other items like ones we sometimes just look at and Nope, return. Perfect shape, they get sold cheaper w/new ones @less cost.Wanted those boots but those 7\'s were too great price, that\'s why sis got them and was gaga over them. So, I ordered size 6, suggested 6.5, too bad, too big but kept just in case.... the size 5\'s I was ordering now, 3rd try, didn\'t fit even though suggested I wear a 6 now! Well the 5\'s came and went, that fraction of inch on R foot, felt fine, but only for few minutes, just fraction too small in toes based on R foot!Last and 4th time! Wow! That tells you how badly I wanted these shoes, they just checked off too many boxes to let them go without a good fight. The 5.5\'s I was sure would fit in a WIDE, had been costly, at over $100 if remember correctly. Figures! Only size left & at most expensive price! Waited a day later, 5.5W\'s & more sizes had come in, ordered them up and got them in about a day. When I saw them, crossed fingers as I thought they were a yes. I have them on now, they feel like they should have been on my feet the whole time! So, the size 5.5W is my size w/just enough room for thick socks or thinner ones. I live in Florida, though kids live in Denver & Boise & France. These will work out fine for all places as it is warm today here & fit & feel great!Updated: 12/1/23, getting later, quicker! After size 7, 6, 5, 5.5W and guess what? Another size 6 was ordered at new price 1/2 of all others, came few days later. Probably wondering what was wrong w/1st size 6\'s? Nothing, just needed to make sure of correct size due to computer blindness, too much shopping. I was getting goofy and thought perhaps all in my head, being too careful. What actually happened was I realized when I put those 5\'s on, I\'d be needing really thick, wool socks and they would be more conducive & warmer to wear in a size 6!!!! Ran to Ross, bought thick wool socks, 2 pairs, eh cheap try. I have finally found my problem, I am a Floridian going to frozen U.S. This past Thursday it was really cold here and even wearing great boots w/socks feet were freezing in few minutes on way to HOA meeting! Thank goodness I used my ""prior northern snow experience"" to kick me in head, loosen up screws and I now firmly believe that I had probably needed to size down one size smaller than the size 7 suggested to the size 6 (I got twice!) or try a wide in next small size if all left. I know I really needed the room, which these boots have plenty of and are warm whereas my Frye\'s were made for Florida & no thick socks! The only dilemma w/sizing is the extra room throughout/around entire toe bed & instep w/room to spare, it\'s the length to think about, like I finally did. I also put in a shoe cushion to help with some of the extra room, then thick socks won over. Still have plenty of room through toe bed area but TOO PRETTY, COMFY & TIRED to second guess anymore, size 6 it is!Merry Christmas Folks! Good Luck with your sizing, hope this finally solves some problems???

They remind me of hiking boots I used to have when I lived back in Pennsylvania growing up.This new pair of Columbia boots are true hiking boots, with cushion all around the ankle and tongue, a flexible thick sole and also appear to be waterproof by design, although haven't tested that yet.The down side is the boots will be too hot to wear in the summer here in Florida, but are working great for the unexpected cold snap right now.

I ordered a brand new pair and also went and bought the warehouse inspected used one on additional discount. The used pair is in perfect condition, not a mark or sign of wear anywhere on them. They’re just like the brand new pair. Perfect!I wear orthotics in my shoes, I tried them both with and without them to see how they feel. I will of course wear them with the orthotics otherwise my plantar fasciitis will get inflamed. I want to wear one pair at work which is standing on my feet my entire shift on cement floors and the other for daily use or camping etc. I will also be spraying a treatment on them for additional protection against the elements.I do have wide feet. One being bigger and slightly wider than the other as well. I always wore a 6.5 shoe, but I guess my feet spread out over time so now I wear 7.5-8 shoes/boots. I went with the 7.5 wide on these and they feel just fine. If I got 8s I think they’d have been too long and I’d be tripping on my own feet. Definitely glad I got the wides they would have been too narrow if I got the regular ones. The orthotics raise my foot in the shoe so I have to loosen the laces a lot to accommodate and this is the first time I’ve had extra length on the laces to tie rather than a teeny amount to tie my shoes!For today I am wearing these around the house to break them in. They feel fine out of the box but I tend to get foot fatigue easily due to my foot condition so I need to break them in. My baby toes always get the brunt of the pain when wearing shoes and especially new shoes. I haven’t felt that pain right away like I normally would. So that’s a plus for comfort!!So far I love these and so glad I bought both pairs! I love the color and the red laces. They remind me of the old hiking boots I used to see growing up, only a more comfortable updated version! The other colors look cute in the pics but I feel limited to what I can wear them with so I feel these are more neutral to the colors I tend to wear. Hopefully these last a long time. I do own other Columbia products and am usually pleased with their products, this is the first time purchasing footwear.Thank you!Edit I’ve been wearing these to work using my orthotics, standing on my feet on cement floor.

I was waiting for a pair of snow boots that I ordered to come in which they didn’t but I knew that these were thick and waterproof so I figured why not wear them while shoveling. Clearly they would be much better at keeping my feet warm and dry compared to my Ugg boots. Which it is no surprise that they actually did! My feet were BONE DRY. I was out there for over an hour walking through nearly knee high snow, both shoveling/clearing off cars in my drive way. I love these shoes. Not only this but I had to go to work and play outside in the snow with my preschool kids and same thing, nice and dry. I also wore them all day, 8-5, and my feet feel great!

The stiffness of the jacket's material makes the elastic, non-adjustable/non-tightenable cuffs fail to make a very good seal around my wrists, and I have pretty fat wrists.-Very thin and actually translucent - If you carry any dark items in the pockets, they can be seen by people (at least for this orange-red color). As I like to carry my dark wallet in the internal pockets of my jackets, it's almost advertised with the translucency of the material.-Absolutely no lining or insulation - I wish they had at least added a mesh lining or something, as the plastic material sticks to your arms if you wear short sleeves. Also, a lining would help to provide a bit of security insomuch as providing a visual barrier (see above regarding the jacket being translucent) - kind of like a security mailing envelope versus a non-security envelope.-Not necessarily a con, but the jacket provides ZERO warmth, so it's only really suitable for warmer rainy days, or to act as a hardshell jacket to go over your own layered clothing selected for colder days - again, this is not necessarily a con.This is a nice jacket overall, very basic and no-frills, with some nice extra features.

Even the hoodie is lined with fur, which worked excellent in keeping his head/neck/mouth area covered from the cold. It was roomy with a Velcro strap to keep it snug, and it is wide enough that it covers the top of the jacket when zipped. There are 3 sets of pockets: down on the side, one on the chest and one inside the jacket. This is great, as you don’t always get a secure inside pocket to tuck away your wallet, keys, money, etc. The size shown is an XX-Large and is a good length in which it would cover down beneath the bum. My husband went out to snow blow wearing a long-sleeve t-shirt and this jacket. He was surprised that it kept him warm, as we were getting snow drifts from the wind. He is pretty thin and he was surprised he didn’t get cold at all. We had a bit of rain a week later, which this jacket did great at repelling water.

The lining is warm and the coat is great in the rain and the length is perfect, I am 5\' 9"" 180 pounds I bought a size large, and it covers right to the bottom of my butt cheeks, keeping my butt dry and warm. I love the coat. It also has a removal zippered hood so you don\'t have to have it hanging there all the time when it\'s not need in warmer weather, etc. But, it will require two changes to the design to make this a perfect coat for me. #1 It needs some velcro closures on the zipper flaps to keep it closed. Yes there are two snaps, at the top and bottom of flaps, but if you\'re wearing gloves they are tough to deal with, and even when buttoned, snow and air could possibly sneak under the flap. Velcro would be a quick and easy way to secure the zipper flap. #2 It needs a double zipper. Because of the length of the jacket, butt cheeks covered, I have to fully unzip it when I sit down in the car, etc. I usually ""hike-it up"" and leave it zippered but it would be more comfortable if it had a double zipper which would allow me to just unzip a few inches from the bottom.

The pocket can only hold something less than 5 inches when velcroed shut. The outside front pocket is the same, only something 5 inches or less can be put in while snapped shut.

Overall, it's a decent choice for a casual bomber jacket, but it does have a small snag that's worth mentioning.Let's start with the good stuff. First off, the V-shaped pattern solid jacquard design instantly caught my eye. It adds a touch of style without going overboard. Plus, the handpicked textured fabric is a win – it's comfortable and breathable, making it ideal for those in-between seasons. No sweat stains for me, thank you very much!Now, let's talk about the fit. The jacket is designed to have a loose fit, which was perfect for my taste. I appreciate its versatility. You can rock it during outdoor adventures, family gatherings, or even while just hanging out on a casual day. It's a jacket for all occasions!Unfortunately, there's a minor issue that cropped up. The zipper, my friends, is a bit finicky. It seems to get stuck quite easily. It's not a dealbreaker, but for the price, I really expected something more durable. The fact that it's made of plastic also leaves me a little uncertain about its longevity. I'm crossing my fingers that it holds up in the long run.Despite the zipper glitch, this jacket is a stylish addition to my wardrobe. The quality is generally good and the fabric has a nice soft feel to it. Just make sure to keep an eye on that zipper while zipping up. If durability is your top priority, you might want to explore other options.

I normally wear a large when it comes to jackets, and this XL is actually very big/roomy - so I think it does live up to its description of ""loose fitting"" - or at the very least, it\'s not smaller than I expected.As for the jacket, it\'s more of a light jacket/sweater jacket vs. an actual bomber jacket, I think only the collar gives you any kind of impression that this is something like a bomber. I think the jacket looks pretty good, and mine has a texture to the fabric that is interesting (although gives it the more sweater feel).

I wear a men\'s large shirt and measure just over 46"" through the chest, and this item fits closely when it is zipped. I highly recommend following the size chart!2. This is not at all what I would call a ""bomber jacket"" (again, this should be obvious from the pictures). A ""zip sweater"" or even ""track jacket"" would be a more accurate description.With that said, I do like this jacket. The fit is a little tighter than I expected, but it is attractive and the quality is good. The exception to that quality is the zipper! Right out of the packaging, the zipper was difficult to use. After several uses, it seemed to loosen up a tiny bit, but it still requires a bit of wiggling when first engaging it in order to zip the jacket successfully.

That is a bit disappointing since I wanted something loose fitting, and I proably should have gone with the 3XL - but then again, I don't want a jacket with drooping shoulders as well if it's too big. Otherwise, it looks ok as a regular fit jacket.Otherwise, it looks good and textured very much as the description, but just think of these sizes as Asian sizes and you should probably go bigger.

I don’t ride motorcycles and don’t plan on going into any blizzards with this. I should mention that Amazon indicated that even though I normally order a medium, others with my same preference bought a large and it fit better. So I ordered a large. It’s a good jacket. Thin. And by thin I mean not like a real, thick, heavy moto jacket. This one is soft. When I put it on it felt like I’d owned it for a while. Fit like a glove. I absolutely love it. Sipped up a little tight around my gut, but I’ve been hitting the churros kinda hard recently. Also, unless I luck out or order things custom tailored- sleeves always fit me long, as they did with this jacket. I am totally okay with it; it’s a minor thing to me given how great the rest of it fit and how much it cost. I can’t wait for the chance to wear it out. If you ride, this is probably not the jacket for you. Throw a sweater under it and it might be good in cold weather. TL;DR Outstanding jacket for the price.

The aesthetic is great, I loved the way it looked before I bought it and still loved it when it arrived TODAY but the measurements are kind of unusual. I bought a medium, which is the smallest size available that will fit me based on sleeve length and chest/shoulder size. I’m a 6’1, 180lb man with a pretty wide chest and shoulders. The sleeves end right where I’d like them, and the simple button cuffs feel right at home where they rest when I’m wearing the jacket. And that’s something I struggle with so I love it.However the sleeves and body of the jacket seem to be pretty voluminous. If I bend my arm, the sheer amount of extra space and fabric is evident. In the sample picture, where the cuff is on my wrist is where it is when my arm is relaxed as well. The sleeve hasn’t fallen down in the picture, so there isn’t any reason for there to be that much fabric bunched up in the arm. Similarity, the machined quality is evident, as is the fact that it was probably manufactured dome time ago snd put in storage. The wrinkling is expected but the “stand collar” is dented and creased so severely it looks like the coat you find in the back of your closet that has been pinned under your grandmother’s old Rainbow vacuum for half of a decade. Basically, it’s gonna take more than the average steam to smooth out.This issue is more of a personal thing, but the first thing I did was remove the brand tag inside. No offense to the manufacturers, but I don’t drive off of the car lot with the dealer plate border on either (unless you’re paying me, I am not advertising for you) and the tag inside this jacket is HUGE. I own clothes ranging from $10 Hanes sleep pants to a $650 leather jacket. One of the few things I’ve noticed is that the larger and more obnoxious the manufacturers fingerprint is, the lower the quality of the item is. (For instance both those Hanes pants and that leather jacket have visible tags are less than 2x2 inches and both items of clothing have proven their durability over 3+ years of continued and aggressive use). Let’s hope that trend does not continue here.Now for the reason that this jacket is perfect, amazing, and I want more than one:This is a no frills jacket. There aren’t pointless zippers that don’t give access to anything, there aren’t odd logos or characters displayed in odd places. This jacket is a blank canvas on the outside with ample seamwork. I like to personalize my clothes a little bit (a small colored thread accent here, maybe putting new buttons on, maybe a lapel pin or sew-on patch) and this jacket seems to be designed specifically with that in mind. Not to mention, because of the aforementioned seamwork, it’ll be easy to take the baggy parts in without compromising the jacket’s structural integrity. (If you are unable to do a job like that yourself, it’s jot usually costly to get an adjustment like that made.).So there it is: while I have a lot of small grievances against whoever designed this jacket personally, the things I love about it faaaaaaar outweigh the negatives. For an extra $20-$40 or just your own time, this good-looking but plain and oddly-designed jacket could be your personalized masterpiece. I like it, and I intend to buy the next one in small, just to see if the base fit is better as the measurements from the seller make no sense. But I intend to have this jacket in navy and black as well as the green I already bought. And there’s a thicker winterized version that I’m probably going to end up owning at least two of them.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 2, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Husband loves it!', 'author': 'Sam', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""Fits perfect!

It's not too tight anywhere even when zipped up. It's a jacket that fits and is warm, so pretty much exactly what I ordered and expected.Some things to note:1) Sherpa is really freaking warm. If it's 30 degrees outside, this feels great. If its 60 or more, I'm sweating.2) The sleeves are made of a smoother material that isn't sherpa. This has an odd, pleasing cooling effect that balances the heat.3) While the jacket fits, the hood does feel overly large, but you can't have it all, right?4) There are pockets where you'd expect but that's it. There are no inside pockets and no other pockets outside of the typical left/right pockets. They're reasonably deep so I'm not worried about anything falling out.5) I had to pick a color motif that wasn't my first choice. Despite that, the charcoal, blue, white design looks better than it does in the picture, though, I'd have preferred a darker, more solid color. I chose this design based on time constraints...I needed a jacket fast.6) Speaking of needing it fast...the item was scheduled to arrive via prime shipping on Sunday. I ordered Saturday for a trip where I'd leave on Wednesday early am. The jacket was late and didn't arrive until Weds.

Suddenly, we learned that there was unseasonable snowfall along the Danube and it was going to continue. I was in need of waterproof hiking boots and I bought these on Amazon in last minute desperation. (They arrived literally one hour before we left for the airport!) Because of a bunion on my right foot, I do need a wider shoe but I’ve learned that most wides aren’t truly wide and I sometimes have to buy a men’s size. Not so with these! Although I did swap out the insole with the inserts I wear in my workout shoes for more arch support, these shoes needed no break-in time in Europe. The very first day we were walking in snow in Prague and over the course of 10 days, I walked an average of 6 miles a day in snowy, icy cities. The shoes felt like I had been wearing them for months already. No blisters, no red spots from rubbing, just a really comfortable shoe that kept my feet dry and warm. I’m so excited about these that, even though these were on sale, I’m going to buy a second pair in another color at full price.

I’ve worn them twice so far while running errands to see how they feel and I have to say, no discomfort and so lightweight!!Now down to sizing: With stylish boots, I’m typically a size 8, and I did order an 8 initially, however with a thin sock, they felt pretty snug and I thought maybe they might start to bother my toes since there’s more cushion that what I’m used to and what if I want to wear thick socks?For me that was enough to go up to an 8.5 juuuust to be on the safe side and because…why not find out? $75 is still $75.So glad I did!

Only took 5 tries to find Prince Charming's Boot!"", 'author': 'FLGulfGrnEz', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I read the reviews wherever I could find them. I had become very confused over the sizing. I have a hard enough time getting the right size without this much of a difference thrown at me too!I was in love @first glance, beautiful dark gray with aqua strings. Ordered size 7 as suggested though I wear a size 6.5 or 6. Feet measures a size 5-5.5, L=8.5"" R=8.7"". There lies the rub, right foot doesn\'t fit sizes same as left one by a fraction so hit or miss. Also, remember, as you age, your feet spread causing sizing up like me to 6.5 in shoes, 7 usually in boots but style can put you back to regular size if they are rounded toe box or squared box mostly in western styles. Shoes strings are very helpful as they can be adjusted to make more room, not more length. Mules are easier to get by smaller sized if you don\'t have toes that won\'t go entire way down, heel hangs off, usually good bet as mostly open. Overall best choice in any type of foot covering is ""Leather"", your friend for stretching if little small as they will mold to feet, put in a cushion before wearing though. Zippers are the bomb for higher topped boots/shoes especially with fat feet, high instep, opens the slimmer top for feet to get to sole.Back to the size sessions; First was great price on 7\'s, looked order back up and saw where I had ordered from the warehouse! Wow, what a great mistake... for my sis! Really, check it out. What others say about buying ""like new"", warehouse, etc., if you don\'t check it out, you are making HUGE mistake. I would never had known if not curious then found sticker where stated, ""checked by warehouse"". Besides, if you don\'t like what you receive, give them to your sis for Christmas! If that\'s not acceptable, check returns, usually can send back w/30 days from Amazon, look at rules though. Truly, you need to check the other items like ones we sometimes just look at and Nope, return. Perfect shape, they get sold cheaper w/new ones @less cost.Wanted those boots but those 7\'s were too great price, that\'s why sis got them and was gaga over them. So, I ordered size 6, suggested 6.5, too bad, too big but kept just in case.... the size 5\'s I was ordering now, 3rd try, didn\'t fit even though suggested I wear a 6 now! Well the 5\'s came and went, that fraction of inch on R foot, felt fine, but only for few minutes, just fraction too small in toes based on R foot!Last and 4th time! Wow! That tells you how badly I wanted these shoes, they just checked off too many boxes to let them go without a good fight. The 5.5\'s I was sure would fit in a WIDE, had been costly, at over $100 if remember correctly. Figures! Only size left & at most expensive price! Waited a day later, 5.5W\'s & more sizes had come in, ordered them up and got them in about a day. When I saw them, crossed fingers as I thought they were a yes. I have them on now, they feel like they should have been on my feet the whole time! So, the size 5.5W is my size w/just enough room for thick socks or thinner ones. I live in Florida, though kids live in Denver & Boise & France. These will work out fine for all places as it is warm today here & fit & feel great!Updated: 12/1/23, getting later, quicker! After size 7, 6, 5, 5.5W and guess what? Another size 6 was ordered at new price 1/2 of all others, came few days later. Probably wondering what was wrong w/1st size 6\'s? Nothing, just needed to make sure of correct size due to computer blindness, too much shopping. I was getting goofy and thought perhaps all in my head, being too careful. What actually happened was I realized when I put those 5\'s on, I\'d be needing really thick, wool socks and they would be more conducive & warmer to wear in a size 6!!!! Ran to Ross, bought thick wool socks, 2 pairs, eh cheap try. I have finally found my problem, I am a Floridian going to frozen U.S. This past Thursday it was really cold here and even wearing great boots w/socks feet were freezing in few minutes on way to HOA meeting! Thank goodness I used my ""prior northern snow experience"" to kick me in head, loosen up screws and I now firmly believe that I had probably needed to size down one size smaller than the size 7 suggested to the size 6 (I got twice!) or try a wide in next small size if all left. I know I really needed the room, which these boots have plenty of and are warm whereas my Frye\'s were made for Florida & no thick socks! The only dilemma w/sizing is the extra room throughout/around entire toe bed & instep w/room to spare, it\'s the length to think about, like I finally did. I also put in a shoe cushion to help with some of the extra room, then thick socks won over. Still have plenty of room through toe bed area but TOO PRETTY, COMFY & TIRED to second guess anymore, size 6 it is!Merry Christmas Folks! Good Luck with your sizing, hope this finally solves some problems??? It was the socks that made all the difference which I kept hearing in almost every review but didn\'t hear the bell in head go off... All\'s good that ends with most comfortable boot for warm & still is especially fab for cold, wet wool sock weather! I can go snow boarding now!

I will of course wear them with the orthotics otherwise my plantar fasciitis will get inflamed. I want to wear one pair at work which is standing on my feet my entire shift on cement floors and the other for daily use or camping etc. I will also be spraying a treatment on them for additional protection against the elements.I do have wide feet. One being bigger and slightly wider than the other as well. I always wore a 6.5 shoe, but I guess my feet spread out over time so now I wear 7.5-8 shoes/boots. I went with the 7.5 wide on these and they feel just fine. If I got 8s I think they’d have been too long and I’d be tripping on my own feet. Definitely glad I got the wides they would have been too narrow if I got the regular ones. The orthotics raise my foot in the shoe so I have to loosen the laces a lot to accommodate and this is the first time I’ve had extra length on the laces to tie rather than a teeny amount to tie my shoes!For today I am wearing these around the house to break them in. They feel fine out of the box but I tend to get foot fatigue easily due to my foot condition so I need to break them in. My baby toes always get the brunt of the pain when wearing shoes and especially new shoes. I haven’t felt that pain right away like I normally would.

But the reason I cannot is based on a couple issues. First of all, I usually wear coats, shirts, and pullovers in the large to extra large sizes. Being 5\'9"" , 210 lbs. with a muscular build does have its challenges. I ordered the XL based on previous reviews. I am glad I did. As others have stated, the sleeves and armpits are snug. The body of the coat was a tad snug as well (belly) , but not uncomfortable. There\'s no way I\'ll be able to layer with this coat though. A sweatshirt isn\'t fitting under this coat for me. I test drove this coat (wearing only a thin shirt underneath) on my usual 4-mile walk right out of the packaging. It was about 35 degrees and sunny here in the Mid-Atlantic. The coat was comfortable for sure. It kept me warm enough. It stopped whatever breeze there may have been. But here\'s one of the detractions, it trapped moisture more than I thought it was designed for. I arrived home with a wet shirt and moisture droplets trapped in the clear ID tag on the back of the nape. The entire inside of the coat was damp, and my phone in the chest pocket was dripping wet. It trapped more moisture than this is supposedly designed to do. So, 4-stars from me because it\'s a good looking coat...And you better order a size up for sure. I\'ll give it another go today and update the review if need be. Using this as a casual coat without an energetic walk may be more appropriate, because it is attractive.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 10, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Peefect', 'author': 'david moss', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Great winter coat', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 10, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars I love this jacket', 'author': 'Michael Lackey', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'If you are between sizes take the larger size.

Seeing a lot of the 6’ commenters say it hits below knees, I was afraid these ponchos would be to my ankles and drag all over. Nope. These come just below my knees. Maybe I’m thick enough to balloon it a few inches sideways? Eh, I’m not exactly fat either, probably would be considered on skinny side in USA. Long story short, it hits at just below my knees. For guys and gals 6’ and over, I’d imagine these will be mid thigh, mileage may vary, but these seem perfect for me.The pros: fabric seems better than I hoped. Thick enough and very light. One thing they don’t seem to mention a lot is that the few rain ponchos(that look like this one) that sell better than this one on Amazon have a 3000mm rating while this one has 5000mm, which means this will likely last longer in rain before wetting out; this was my primary reason I got these over those. Kudos! These fold up super small. They should shrink the storage bag size. Probably made the bag bigger for the people who can’t be bothered to fold and roll and instead just stuffs it back in. Hope people don’t do that, and try to get as many uses as possible(landfills and all that). Fold and roll and there’s too much room left over on the storage bag, but that’s good. Storage bag is roughly size of 16oz water bottle but about 1/3 of it is empty space with the poncho inside. Very small. The pull strings around neck feel rugged for such a (half disposal) item. Price was very reasonable. I got the light grey one primarily by trying to get the lightest visible color for the lowest price. Looks alright.Cons: Nitpicking but ofc, the rain brim on the head is kind of a joke. All floppy floppy and way too big. Haha. Was expected. Not bothered. Snaps seem like they will rip out easily but just be careful or just stow them with them closed all the time? I think I will and hopefully will still be easy to dry like that. Like I said, for very tall folks will likely land mid thigh bordering on waist and may not work so well(I’m guessing 6’ 3” and over these may feel kinda ridiculously short) but works perfect for me.

I still use a pack cover under the poncho but taking a rain jacket on and off is a huge pain when you’re wearing a pack and the rain jacket doesn’t cover your hips or thighs and it doesn’t breathe as well. This poncho is definitely higher quality than those I’ve used in the past. I’ve mostly thought of ponchos as 1 or 2 trip items as they rip and lose their water proofing over time. This one feels sturdier, less likely to rip and is larger so can cover more (but is a little bulkier as a result). Used it in a recent 5-day pack in the Whites with my daughter. We had non stop rain for 1.5 days. This made it through more than half of the first day of say before starting to let some moisture through (inevitable—nothing is truly water proof unless you’re going to wear rubber!) but even then it kept the water flowing off me making the long rain bearable. Some people complain about sizing. It is bigger than others I’ve had but I liked that, given the pack and I’m 5’11” (but skinny). Also, some complain about the hood. I wore a baseball cap underneath and that gave shape to the hood and the peak on the hood largely covered the brim of the hat so it worked out really well.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States November 11, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars It works.

But I do believe the jacket runs just a bit small as well. It is a more boxy cut than the old traditional plain denim Levi Jackets, which had a nice taper to the waist. So the waist of my XL is a little looser than I would really prefer and can ride up, exposing the small of my back to a cold car seat if I'm not careful about how I slide into the seat. Other than that, I am thrilled with this jacket. It has become my absolute go-to for just about anything less than semi-formal wear. It is far warmer than I expected (which is so welcome!) owing no doubt to the sherpa lining. The sleeves are lined with a slicker fabric, somewhat like satin, so there will be no drag on the sleeves of whatever warm clothing you wear under the jacket, which is outstanding and in my experience is not common.

It has synthetic insulation with the shiny reflective interior that does help hold your heat inThe exterior of the coat has a nice wind and water repellent finish and seems more water resistant than a typical down or down alternative coat hasThe hood fits well and you can cinch down the sides and there’s a little brim in front. Overall the jacket seems fine because I always wear a long sleeve layer underneath it in the winterMy gripe, though is that the sleeves and shoulders fit OK but the body is still a little bit too big for size medium if I compare it to an Eddie Bauer or Northface jacket, those fit trimmer in the midsection and that way, it keeps you warmer because less air leaks inSo overall, I would say that this jacket sizes in medium is between a medium and a large. If you don’t wear a layer under it, it might be too big, but if you do wear a layer under it, it’s probably OK .I also appreciate that. It’s slightly shorter than Columbia’s white out or powder light jackets. Those are just too long for me. They look a little odd and it’s hard to get anything out of your pockets. This jacket seems to be one to 2 inches shorter than those models are so the length is better.Overall, the jacket seems to do a decent job of keeping me warm in 30s° temperatures it’s not the warmest jacket I’ve ever tried, but one day it was rainy and cold, and the water seemed to beat up on the outside, and I stayed dry.When you take the jacket off, you can feel how warm the reflective lining keeps youIn the next year’s version, if Columbia would make the torso area just a touch smaller, I think the fit would be really good overall because you still need room in the shoulders and sleeves which this has. thankfully, I don’t have a big gut or else Columbia should leave it the same as it is. :)', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 4, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent jacket!', 'author': 'Paul S.', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'My first order was the size I normally order and it was HUGE!

It was a 3-1 one coat. The negatives were no hood, not wind or water proof. Last week the zipper slide on the inner coat broke. I replaced the slide and washed both the inner and out coat. The zipper on the outer coat tore in the wash. As I had torn the left sleeve last year, I decided it might be time to purchase a new winter coat (after 25 years of rough wear and tear, I figure I got my moneys worth out of that coat).I found the Tipton Peak II at Dick\'s Sporting Goods. The Medium was too tight (just a smidge) in the shoulders. I ordered a large from Amazon. It arrived in new condition, a day early.I\'m 6\'.0"", 160Lbs, 32"" waist, 42"" chest. I wear a 16\' neck and 35"" sleeve. The large is perfect in the shoulders, a smidge long in the arms (not a problem), the body of the coat is very roomy, it could come in a bit, but it isn\'t so big that it looks oversized. I suspect a guy 6\'1"" 200 Lbs would find it about the right size. The large leaves some comfortable room for me to layer.Pro\'s: The coat appears to be well made, tight woven outer fabric appears sturdy and it\'s advertised as waterproof, I\'m thinking it will be windproof as well (as opposed to my other coat which was neither). The hand warmer pockets (very thin fleece) are roomy and secure with a zipper. There is an outer left breast pocket and an inner right breast pocket (both roomy and secure with a zipper). Also an attached hood (roomy and insulated) (Huge plus for me). I was skeptical of the Omni heat liner despite other positive reviews. It does appear to function as promised, I began to over heat just trying the coat on. I\'ll have to wait for colder weather to be sure. I gave the coat 4 stars.Cons: The main zipper is lighter and smaller than the one on my last coat (it lasted 25 years) Time will tell if the lighter zipper will perform as well. The zipper flap attaches with Velcro. Though some may like the Velcro , I prefer snaps (my last coat had heavy duty snaps). There is no draw string at the waist. I feel they could have added an outer right breast pocket and an inner left breast pocket (more pockets = more better), even one on a sleeve. The Omni heat liner is thin and feels flimsy, hopefully it doesn\'t tear easily.All in all, for the sale price of $120.00 it appears to be a really decent coat. However, I would not have purchased it for the original retail price of $180.00.Update 12/21/22 - I\'ve had the opportunity to wear the coat in wind, rain and cold weather. The coat is windproof, which is awesome. I spent 40 minutes in a light rain and remained dry and comfortable. In 40 degree Fahrenheit weather, I was comfortable with the coat and a t-shirt. At 35 degrees, I needed a sweatshirt (I\'m thin and hate cold). Colder than 35 degrees, I wear a thermal top (wool or wool blend) and a sweatshirt under the coat. At 20 degrees with the aforementioned layering, I was quite comfortable. I was skeptical of the Omni heat liner, it seems to work.The coat is quite comfortable to wear and allows for ease of movement. It doesn\'t really need a center draw string as I fist suggested, though it would be nice, the lower drawstring is sufficient to keep out wind.I absolutely love the hood!!! (Yep, you counted correctly, that\'s three exclamation points) It\'s adjustable, and insulated just enough to keep your head warm, should you decide you need a headband or stocking cap, there is plenty of room under the hood for an additional layer.The existing pockets are functional and roomy. The hand warmer pockets are lightly lined and warm. The extra pockets I mentioned in my original post would have been a nice addition, though I can\'t say I really have had need of extra storage space. More pockets are just more better.Still not a fan of the Velcro zipper flap cover, snaps would be better. I think the Velcro looks cheap and it tends to catch as I\'m unzipping the coat.I thought a parka zipper would be better, but have had no issues with the smaller zipper. It may actually be sturdier over time, time will tell.I would upgrade my star rating except for the Velcro zipper flap.I really like the coat.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 30, 2022', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars value for money very comfortable jacket and it feels good', 'author': 'Amazon Customer', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'This jacket keeps me warm on those cold days I love it', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 25, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Good stuff', 'author': 'Jevans', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""Is an unboxing review.

First off, the arms are LONG, about 27in on the Medium. For perspective, my arms from shoulder to wrist are about 24in. Judging by the images of the models it looks like smaller sizes may have shorter arms but I'm not sure. The arm length is by design since this IS a WORK jacket, the arms are supposed to be long. I have to fold the sleeves in a bit, which doesn't bother me. I'm a large female, 5'8, 40in hips. The back of the jacket covers almost half my bum (the front looks a little shorter), it cinches at the end, there's a waist band in the back. The M is snug on my hips without being too snug. I'm 41 in the chest - it's roomy up top but I'm not swimming in it. If I'd gotten a large I think I'd be swimming in it. A small probably would've been too snug for me.

Trying to match it to an existing pair of black pant and the fabric was a lot different. If I was ordering this jacket to dress up for a casual event it would be perfect.

Smith', 'rating': 4, 'content': ""The cut and fit of this jacket is bad. I'm not overly picky; I usually buy off the rack and the fit is perfect. I've ordered cheap jackets on Amazon before and have been completely satisfied. Unless you are looking for a disposable sports coat for a one-time event which will be held in a dark, dark room. Maybe look elsewhere.Specifics:• The collar is cut and pressed funny so it goes up high on the back of your neck. Very stiff and though it's folded down, it looks like you're flipping it up to make some kind of '80s style statement.• That white line in the pocket is not a handkerchief or a paper insert for decoration, it's sewn in and looks incredibly cheap up close. But you can fold it down to be hidden, which makes a slight lump, but better than up.• I'm pretty thin so the jacket fit well around my waist, the length was good. But the cut of the lapel was so bad that I looked like Bruce Banner in a mid-Hulk moment around the chest. The lapel does not lay naturally, it opens wide like a poorly-fitting tux coat. Even with the button undone, it flares to the side a bit and looks like it fits on the bottom but is a size too small across the chest. Strangely, the shoulders fit okay, except for...• ...the shoulder pads. Yes, thick, uneven shoulder pads. Felt strange, looked strange.• The buttons look like cheap plastic. I know for $30 they are going to be cheap plastic, but there's a difference between BEING cheap plastic and looking from 10 feet away like cheap plastic. It looks and feels like the material in a disposable plastic spoon.• Last point, but there's more: The jacket is fully lined and the lining does not look too bad, BUT when you put your arms into the sleeves, you push the lining out of the other end with your hands so you kind of have to tuck the lining back into your sleeve once you have the jacket on.I was going to return this, but for $30, it hardly seems worth the effort. I'm going to have it steamed and pressed to try to fix some of the sleeve and collar issues and am replacing the buttons with better-looking cheap plastic.One thing I do like about the jacket is the pockets in front are real and fairly large. I hate when sports coats sew the pockets shut to help the line of the jacket. Also the inside pocket, though only one, is pretty functional. The outer pocket flaps also tuck in if you like a cleaner look, so it's not all bad.If you're looking for a good alternative, it's not as low-priced, but the jackets by Ferrecci-Zonettie here on Amazon are great.UPDATE:After wearing the jacket for a few months, some of the flaws have diminished. Fabric has relaxed a bit. It still has most of the problems I mentioned above, but surprisingly, has worn fairly well. I've been rough on it, too, thinking it'd start coming apart at the seams giving me an excuse to toss it. But so far even the too-loose lining has held up to activity.

I do not go camping with it so I don\'t need one of the heavy duty, really expensive ones from, say, REI or something. I wear it inside and around town. But the Amazon Basics one is not super warm by itself. I think it\'s probably a standard ""light"" fleece. But because it\'s kind of thin, it doesn\'t always do the job by itself, and I often have to layer on a sweatshirt or something. So I was curious if there was slightly thicker, warmer one out there that still wasn\'t bulky. The weight on this one seemed to be a little heavier than Amazon\'s so I thought I\'d give it a try. I bought 1 from Amazon and this one. Now I haven\'t put them through any rigorous testing, but so far, my first impression is that I THINK this one is indeed a little heavier. It looks good (I got the maroon and it actually looks pretty snappy), and a strip along the inside of the collar that\'s a different color from the rest of the jacket is a nice stylistic touch if you don\'t zip it up all the way and makes the jacket look a little classier.

I prefer jackets like this more on the snug side rather than baggy, and a small fits the bill for me. The sleeve length is perfect, and although it\'s a little tight around the chest and torso, I don\'t mind it too much. I think it\'ll probably stretch out somewhat. The fleece is snug and warm. The elastic, adjustable drawstrings on either side of the fleece, at the waist, are a nice addition, but because of the snug fit all around, I probably won\'t need to use them. I was pleasantly surprised at the overall quality. Again, after reading multiple reviews, I was sort of worried about the zipper failing. However, it appears to be reasonably sturdy, but I suppose time will tell. The material is a little stiffer than expected, but it\'s OK overall.

When you pay more for the same fleece you're paying for that label on your chest. This fleece fits perfectly and is soft and very thick. Last weekend I was out camping and it was in the lower 30s in the evening and the only thing I was wearing on my torso was a long sleeve shirt and this fleece and I was comfortable all night long. It was just slightly windy so I'm sure that helped. In the morning it was 21F but I felt fairly comfy even with the morning chills and this fleece and a Marmot soft shell over it. I don't need another one but I'm sadly tempted to just buy another in a different color.Update - Jan 15, 2017: Since my first fleece in March 2014 I bought another in Nov 2014 then another in Oct 2016. All three fit and feel exactly the same. Yes, all three zippers will go crazy on you if you're too careless with it but it has only happened maybe 5 times on me in almost three years now and I wear them quite frequently. Even now in the 20s it's my sole jacket when I drive to work since it's just a short walk from the parking lot and such. When I walk a mile to my train station I'll still wear this and my soft shell over it down to the 20s and I'm still quite comfortable, if not too warm. Oddly the description now says 13.8 oz but that must be for the tiniest size. A medium weighs 17.4 oz. I'm planning on thru hiking the PCT in 2018 so every fraction of an ounce counts but I've been considering taking this over my 10 oz down jacket for the wetter sections since it works so effectively against moisture. I've gone on cold day hikes with this and a soft shell and I would feel comfortable but when I take my soft shell off I could feel the moisture on the outside of the fleece but absolutely nothing on the inside.

Be sure to refer to the size chart diligently before ordering.Limited Warmth: While it's reasonably warm, it may not be the best option for extremely cold conditions, as it lacks the robust insulation of more expensive wool coats.Durability Concerns: Some users have reported issues with the durability of the jacket, particularly with buttons coming loose.In conclusion, the Wantdo Men's Wool Blend Jacket is a reasonable choice for those who want to stay stylish while dealing with moderate cold. However, it may not be the warmest or most durable option on the market.

I really like the coffee color which is a black and brown twill fabric. Buttons a back gloss plastic with a silver edge binding. All my buttons were in good shape and securely sewn. My coat came with a single extra button. A single vertical zipper pocket is on the left breast. The zipper is chunky and unbranded but the action is smooth and it works. On the collar there is a silver buckle and black snap that can be used on cold days. I haven’t used it but the construction looks sturdy. There are simple interior pockets without buttons or zippers on the left and right breast. Again, construction seems sturdy. The lower exterior pockets have superfluous buttons but the pockets themselves are sturdy and warm.The fit is reasonably modern (i.e. slim) for me in a good way. However, I do have a fairly athletic build with a 42”+ chest and a 32”- waist. I really liked the fit at my shoulders and I would have preferred a closer fit at my middle— though with my build I can’t reasonably expect that from anything but a tailored coat. Length is just about right, with the coat extending down to the bottom of my jean pockets. Weight is also as advertised. The medium weigh keeps me warm in Southern California winters and would work well in Midwestern springs or autumns.Overall I’d recommend the coat. It looks good, the construction seems to be quality (though I think the fabric blend at only 20% wool is mediocre) it’s warm and the fit is good if not great.

Performed like a champ.EASY TO CARRY: Collapses into its own little bag by stuffing itself into the right pocket. Note that there is no difference between the left and right pocket EXCEPT that the right pocket has a second zipper pull so that you can close the pocket when it is inside-out (because you stuffed the rest of the jacket into it). Doing this or even just quickly rolling the jacket up means you can carry it easily in your day pack. Light weight and low volume.WATER RESIST: Pretty good performance! taped seams. I wore it in medium rain and it kept my top dryHOOD: another reviewer complained that the hood was too long a drooped over the eyes, obscuring vision. Simple fix! Use the velcro tab back at the base of the neck to adjust how much the hood can go forward. Adjusting the velcro an inch can make a big difference! Also you can roll the hood down and tuck it into the collar.BREATHABILITY: This is waterproof and not Gore-tex (which would cost way more) so its not really breathable. But it has deep pit-zips on both sides, a reliable no-stick zipper in front, and wide sleeves at the wrist (adjustable with velcro) so you can easily create some airflow.WARMTH: Not really much insulation. But if you combine it with other layers, it can work well. For instance, I wore a t-shirt and a merino wool sweater with the jacket in reserve in my backpack. As afternoon became evening and the temperature dropped down by 10 degrees F. I put on the jacket and a knit hat and was fine. So the jacket is good for iffy weather but also for cooling at night if you're out for a full day.STYLE: It's reasonably good looking outdoor/active wear. Clean lines and lays smooth. Mine is the deep blue.DURABILITY: Seems well made. All the stitching and zippers are good quality. I have a Marmot high end gore-tex jacket and Marmot ski pants that perform well for years. So I trust the Marmot brand. This lightweight jacket seems to be quality too. No issues on my trip but I've only had the jacket two months.OVERALL: This is an easy 5 stars if your looking for easy to pack water and wind protection that looks good and fits comfortably at an affordable price point.

I am normally a Medium in most outdoor name brands. I can wear a fleece sweater under this jacket and still keep my binoculars strapped to my chest and not feel constrained. A sweater or lighter fleece will work well with the correct sizing. Don\'t expect to get a lot of flex from the soft shell. This material is NOT like the NorthFace, Sitka or other tech brands in terms of soft shell flexibility. It isn not the most quiet jacket I have used but still not as loud as a full on rain jacket. The pit zips are great for venting and easy to access. The front pockets have D rings sewn in the tops of the pockets to allow clipping of items such as gloves or other gear. As well both chest pockets have an audio cable routing hole as does the right shoulder pocket. The back pocket is fleece lined and holds a hat and gloves with no problem. I can also fit a water bottle without an issue. It has NO internal pockets, but good placement of external pockets. The internal fleece is on the thinner side but more than enough for a layered system. So far I have only used the jacket outside in the rain once and it did keep me dry. It\'s not built for a serious deluge or torrential downpour. The fabric that makes up the soft shell can absorb water but this will withstand a mist/ wet fog/ sleet without a problem for a short duration. It is not meant to be rain jacket but rather deter water from getting to you allowing you to keep warm. I am thinking it will benefit from a treatment like Nikwax softshell to keep the water at bay. The hood / collar is well made with a functional visor, cinch chords inside and velcro allowing folding or rolling for 2 positions, a tall neck shield collar and a regular band collar. The hood has room to be worn with a watch cap or a baseball cap. Haven\'t tried it with shooting earphones yet but it should work. The elbows have an additional layer on top of the main layer to help with durability. I have the army green version so I can\'t speak to the other colors or camo versions that are made by similar companies.

It is a bit bulky and I wasn't sure about how it was stored when not in use (rolled up at the collar), but after several days of use i actually like it, especially when i am driving and it is a bit of a cushion on the neck.

I can wear this rain or shine, 30 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit or even 20 if I wear a long sleeve underneath. Water doesn’t bead at all and the hoodie is sufficient at keeping rain and wind of your face. It’s sleek and I constantly get compliments on it. It’s not perfect though and they’re minimal.Con:-The cuff plastic hook and loop (velcro )is utterly awful. It never properly worked and would open up constantly to where it was almost dangerous to wear the jacket. I’m in law enforcement and if the company is actually made up of military veterans then they should know how important securing stuff to your body is. One instance my cuff went over my hand as I was drawing my firearm at the range. Being a controlled environment I holstered and took off the jacket so it wouldn’t go over my hand or affect my grip, imagine if that was an emergency and prevented me from using my hands properly because the cuff got in the way or caught onto something. I have a fix which I go over later.- The roll up hoodie looks ridiculous, bulky and unprofessional. That’s about all I have to say on that, your coworkers will notice and they will dog on you about the new neck brace you have on lol.Improvements:- I suggest switching the cuff to actual hook & loop or velcro. I personally used a razor blade and shaved off the plastic nubs and cuz some both side of velcro to the cuff. I used a bit of additional fabric glue and let it dry under a 25lb plate to cure overnight just in case. It is vastly superior works very well.- I would love for there to be pen pockets on the sleeve for my pen and handcuff key.- A removable hoodie would make it look very professional and work with some policies as my department head actually didn’t approve of this jacket due to the hoodie until an incident with a coworker actually had him change his mind of that policy. Also I know you can roll up the hoodie and velcro it down to become a “collar” but it looks terrible, and looks more like a neck brace rather than a collar.Overall this is a fantastic jacket and with some tiny improvements this can be THE tactical jacket.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States November 29, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Good mid-weight jacket', 'author': 'Craig Cronquist', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Perfect for what I wanted.

That’s not a bad thing, as this is a soft shell jacket and that’s sort of the the whole point and style. It’s not too tight or small, which is what I was worried about.I own several Carhartt jackets, and this is perfect for cool days and nights. I needed a lightweight water resistant and wind proof jacket to get me through October to late Fall here in Tennessee, and this jacket did the trick.As far as comfort rating and temperature, I can wear this with only a T-shirt and sit on my porch and stay totally warm from 55 degrees and up. No activity in other words.If I’m mowing or walking and moving, this jacket keeps me comfortable down to about 50 degrees. If you layer with a lightweight cotton/nylon blend sweater, add 10 degrees to the above assessment. Comfy down to 45 degrees. If I wear an actual shirt designed to retain warmth (a layering shirt made for that purpose), I can add another 5 degrees of warmth.The material inside the jacket is a tiny grid of micro fleece. But the jacket does a fantastic job at blocking the wind and shedding rain, and that alone adds comfort value in cooler temperatures.I love it so much that I’m ordering others in different colors.My only complaint is that it tends to ride up if driving. No big deal as I just pull it back down when I’m out of my truck. Think Captain Picard and his uniform top.

Ordered size 7 as suggested though I wear a size 6.5 or 6. Feet measures a size 5-5.5, L=8.5"" R=8.7"". There lies the rub, right foot doesn\'t fit sizes same as left one by a fraction so hit or miss. Also, remember, as you age, your feet spread causing sizing up like me to 6.5 in shoes, 7 usually in boots but style can put you back to regular size if they are rounded toe box or squared box mostly in western styles. Shoes strings are very helpful as they can be adjusted to make more room, not more length. Mules are easier to get by smaller sized if you don\'t have toes that won\'t go entire way down, heel hangs off, usually good bet as mostly open. Overall best choice in any type of foot covering is ""Leather"", your friend for stretching if little small as they will mold to feet, put in a cushion before wearing though. Zippers are the bomb for higher topped boots/shoes especially with fat feet, high instep, opens the slimmer top for feet to get to sole.Back to the size sessions; First was great price on 7\'s, looked order back up and saw where I had ordered from the warehouse! Wow, what a great mistake... for my sis! Really, check it out. What others say about buying ""like new"", warehouse, etc., if you don\'t check it out, you are making HUGE mistake. I would never had known if not curious then found sticker where stated, ""checked by warehouse"". Besides, if you don\'t like what you receive, give them to your sis for Christmas! If that\'s not acceptable, check returns, usually can send back w/30 days from Amazon, look at rules though. Truly, you need to check the other items like ones we sometimes just look at and Nope, return. Perfect shape, they get sold cheaper w/new ones @less cost.Wanted those boots but those 7\'s were too great price, that\'s why sis got them and was gaga over them. So, I ordered size 6, suggested 6.5, too bad, too big but kept just in case.... the size 5\'s I was ordering now, 3rd try, didn\'t fit even though suggested I wear a 6 now! Well the 5\'s came and went, that fraction of inch on R foot, felt fine, but only for few minutes, just fraction too small in toes based on R foot!Last and 4th time! Wow! That tells you how badly I wanted these shoes, they just checked off too many boxes to let them go without a good fight. The 5.5\'s I was sure would fit in a WIDE, had been costly, at over $100 if remember correctly. Figures! Only size left & at most expensive price! Waited a day later, 5.5W\'s & more sizes had come in, ordered them up and got them in about a day. When I saw them, crossed fingers as I thought they were a yes. I have them on now, they feel like they should have been on my feet the whole time! So, the size 5.5W is my size w/just enough room for thick socks or thinner ones. I live in Florida, though kids live in Denver & Boise & France. These will work out fine for all places as it is warm today here & fit & feel great!Updated: 12/1/23, getting later, quicker! After size 7, 6, 5, 5.5W and guess what? Another size 6 was ordered at new price 1/2 of all others, came few days later. Probably wondering what was wrong w/1st size 6\'s? Nothing, just needed to make sure of correct size due to computer blindness, too much shopping. I was getting goofy and thought perhaps all in my head, being too careful. What actually happened was I realized when I put those 5\'s on, I\'d be needing really thick, wool socks and they would be more conducive & warmer to wear in a size 6!!!! Ran to Ross, bought thick wool socks, 2 pairs, eh cheap try. I have finally found my problem, I am a Floridian going to frozen U.S. This past Thursday it was really cold here and even wearing great boots w/socks feet were freezing in few minutes on way to HOA meeting! Thank goodness I used my ""prior northern snow experience"" to kick me in head, loosen up screws and I now firmly believe that I had probably needed to size down one size smaller than the size 7 suggested to the size 6 (I got twice!) or try a wide in next small size if all left. I know I really needed the room, which these boots have plenty of and are warm whereas my Frye\'s were made for Florida & no thick socks! The only dilemma w/sizing is the extra room throughout/around entire toe bed & instep w/room to spare, it\'s the length to think about, like I finally did. I also put in a shoe cushion to help with some of the extra room, then thick socks won over. Still have plenty of room through toe bed area but TOO PRETTY, COMFY & TIRED to second guess anymore, size 6 it is!Merry Christmas Folks! Good Luck with your sizing, hope this finally solves some problems??? It was the socks that made all the difference which I kept hearing in almost every review but didn\'t hear the bell in head go off... All\'s good that ends with most comfortable boot for warm & still is especially fab for cold, wet wool sock weather! I can go snow boarding now! Uh Oh, gotta get lined pants, knit cap, goggles, warmer gloves, down filled vest...

I ordered a brand new pair and also went and bought the warehouse inspected used one on additional discount. The used pair is in perfect condition, not a mark or sign of wear anywhere on them. They’re just like the brand new pair. Perfect!I wear orthotics in my shoes, I tried them both with and without them to see how they feel. I will of course wear them with the orthotics otherwise my plantar fasciitis will get inflamed. I want to wear one pair at work which is standing on my feet my entire shift on cement floors and the other for daily use or camping etc. I will also be spraying a treatment on them for additional protection against the elements.I do have wide feet. One being bigger and slightly wider than the other as well. I always wore a 6.5 shoe, but I guess my feet spread out over time so now I wear 7.5-8 shoes/boots. I went with the 7.5 wide on these and they feel just fine. If I got 8s I think they’d have been too long and I’d be tripping on my own feet. Definitely glad I got the wides they would have been too narrow if I got the regular ones. The orthotics raise my foot in the shoe so I have to loosen the laces a lot to accommodate and this is the first time I’ve had extra length on the laces to tie rather than a teeny amount to tie my shoes!For today I am wearing these around the house to break them in. They feel fine out of the box but I tend to get foot fatigue easily due to my foot condition so I need to break them in. My baby toes always get the brunt of the pain when wearing shoes and especially new shoes. I haven’t felt that pain right away like I normally would. So that’s a plus for comfort!!So far I love these and so glad I bought both pairs! I love the color and the red laces. They remind me of the old hiking boots I used to see growing up, only a more comfortable updated version! The other colors look cute in the pics but I feel limited to what I can wear them with so I feel these are more neutral to the colors I tend to wear. Hopefully these last a long time. I do own other Columbia products and am usually pleased with their products, this is the first time purchasing footwear.Thank you!Edit I’ve been wearing these to work using my orthotics, standing on my feet on cement floor.

Clearly they would be much better at keeping my feet warm and dry compared to my Ugg boots. Which it is no surprise that they actually did! My feet were BONE DRY. I was out there for over an hour walking through nearly knee high snow, both shoveling/clearing off cars in my drive way. I love these shoes. Not only this but I had to go to work and play outside in the snow with my preschool kids and same thing, nice and dry. I also wore them all day, 8-5, and my feet feel great!

It’s not too tight or small, which is what I was worried about.I own several Carhartt jackets, and this is perfect for cool days and nights. I needed a lightweight water resistant and wind proof jacket to get me through October to late Fall here in Tennessee, and this jacket did the trick.As far as comfort rating and temperature, I can wear this with only a T-shirt and sit on my porch and stay totally warm from 55 degrees and up. No activity in other words.If I’m mowing or walking and moving, this jacket keeps me comfortable down to about 50 degrees. If you layer with a lightweight cotton/nylon blend sweater, add 10 degrees to the above assessment. Comfy down to 45 degrees. If I wear an actual shirt designed to retain warmth (a layering shirt made for that purpose), I can add another 5 degrees of warmth.The material inside the jacket is a tiny grid of micro fleece. But the jacket does a fantastic job at blocking the wind and shedding rain, and that alone adds comfort value in cooler temperatures.I love it so much that I’m ordering others in different colors.My only complaint is that it tends to ride up if driving. No big deal as I just pull it back down when I’m out of my truck. Think Captain Picard and his uniform top.

I don\'t expect water proof, just to keep it at bay for a while. Have yet to actually put it through its paces.I gave my only waterproof jacket to my mom as she needed it when we were out once. She loved wearing it, so I said she could keep it. Thus, I now need a replacement as I have nothing else water resistant and will be going on a 2 wk trip to Norway in mid June. It is still cool above the arctic circle in June. I needed one garmet that could cover a decent range of weather. This was cheap, water resistant and had a good hood. I took a chance (having time to return and get something else if I didn\'t like it). Got it yesterday and gave it a good exam and wear around the house. It is exactly as advertised. I ordered a 2XL as I am in between XL and 2XL in most things and just erred on the side of safety. The 2XL fits PERFECTLY. It has enough room still for a fleece or hoodie underneath. For reference, I am 5\'8"" and 240lbs (stocky not round). The jacket\'s shell is very comfortable fabric that has some stretch, so it moves very nicely with you and seems reasonably durable. The thin fleece liner is nice and makes it much more comfortable to wear. The pockets and stitching all look well done and pass my initial exam. The dual zipper works very well. I have an ICON motorcycle jacket with a dual zipper that sucks. Was worried this would too, nope. The rest of the zippers all work very well. I kept saying to myself, this was only $32. I should buy more. The hood, when rolled up, isn\'t ideal, but fine. Just leaving it down is likely how I will roll. Also, the velcro on the hood is a bit misaligned. Not bad and still works fine, but I notice it. This jacket appears to be identical to the Free Soldier jacket (like many things on Amazon - same thing, different brand names and prices), just in this case, much cheaper. For the money, this is AMAZING.Note on the sizing chart: It appears that the Chest size is the actual circumference of the fabric, not your suit coat size. Thus, if I wanted it to wear it bare chested like skin, a small would be perfect (49 chest) You have to account for how many extra inches you want inside to account for shirts and potentially layers, for reference, the 2XL was ideal for me.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States June 1, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Quality jacket.

MCU color pattern was accurate and shade was accurate. Bought a Small for my son who\'s 5\'7"" and 115lbs, very slight build. Fits very nice, has plenty room for layering underneath, but not so much it\'s too big. Arm length fit nicely, but he is very lanky body type. Keep this in mind for shorter arm body type, as they may be long. Double layered elbow reinforced. Drawsting bungee bottom for tightening. Bottom sides curve upwards for pistol drawing or holster placement. Drops back down in front and in the rear. Great for rain run off over belt line. Nothing worse than a shortback jacket that drains right into your crack. Hood is large but has a drawstring and will roll down and draw tight for storage, very nice feature. Most do not stow away like a high collar, they just flop around a collect water like a bucket. Zippers are not yyk, but seem to be sturdy enough. Plenty of pockets, but the down side of all the pockets are their depth. This keeps it from being perfect. Inner pocket seam is straight across at the bottom, very shallow. Meaning, things could fall out very easy if it\'s not zipped up partially. It\'s my only real complaint. Waterproof\'ish, heavy downpours for extended time will eventually waterlog it. Very good water resistant is more accurate. But it does hold water out for a good period of time, very satisfied considering. Fleece lining is a touch too thin for my liking, but definitely acceptable especially for layering and cost of jacket. Under arm zippers will be felt, if you decide to wear it in short sleeves. But not a deal breaker by no means. You\'ll just know they are there. Underarm vents are large, and easy to grab zipper to open and close. Great feature most don\'t offer. The tail pocket is also very shallow, but in my opinion the best feature of the jacket. Large enough for extra storage out of the way, and keeps bulk from the front of the jacket. Works as a rear magazine dump pouch for me. Unzip halfway on 1 side, keeps empty mags in the pocket without falling out when moving around and running. Easy to reach and large enough to hold 3-4 AR style mags easily. Velcro works, arm pockets are plentiful, but shallow. Bought for playing airsoft in milsim\'s and other events, hunting, camping, etc.. in inclement weather without wearing or carrying a ton of gear, ie..warbelt, chest rig, or extra under layers. Challenge was met and has exceeded my expectations. I bought 3xl for myself in green. I own Columbia jacket that\'s similar. Columbia fleece is thicker, zippers are better quality. This jacket has more features, for well under half the price. It\'s a great budget friendly but very serviceable jacket. I\'ve done a ton of reviews and give a straight forward opinion. This is a winner for anyone not wanting to spend $80-150 for a similar type jacket. This jacket deserved this much detailed information, for the under $37 or whatever I paid.

And the exterior pockets are massive; much bigger in comparison to BS. And it also has rear pockets (BS calls it a map pocket). It's hood is good and has the little bill. Also, it has thumb holes where BS does not (if you're into that). They are small and kinda dig into your thumbs. The waistline does adjust to prevent airflow.Cons: The zipper is on the wrong side and does not zip as smoothly as its expensive competitor. Thumb holes do not equate to adjustable cuffs. The hood does NOT adjust (this is my biggest problem with the entire thing, actually). As others have said, the hood is a little big and floppy and given lack of adjustment, it's almost useless unless you want to go sailing. One last thing compared to BS, the zipper does not have the wind resistant inner flap like its competitor.Differences but but neither good/bad: It's fits different. It's not as bulky (both are mediums). This one fits tighter, but not because it's smaller, but rather because it isn't as thick.So there ya go. I suppose you're here because you're considering BS.

Once the price fell to under $40, I jumped, and since I really needed proper winter coat, it was a no-brainer purchase for me. Well, I’m happy to report that this is an EXCELLENT jacket! The corduroy on the outside is stylish, and the quilted inner-lining has provided me with a nice insulation in chilly 20-degree temps. Also, the lining is slick and the coat easily slides right on and off. The stitching is great, without any loose sloppy threading, and the zipper is robust, and glides up and down smoothly. Furthermore, the collar is surprisingly very pliable, so in colder temperatures, you can bend it upwards to protect your neck from the elements. The pockets on the bottom, though buttonless, are roomy enough for my hands, and as far as the chest pockets, I can’t comment as I haven’t used them. Size large fit me perfectly.

Not sure if it was due to the poor reviews about the hand pockets size but either those complaints were bogus (and there were plenty of them) or the manufactures fixed the problem. The hand pockets are perfect. The complaint was that the pockets were shallow and you'd barely get your fingers inside but on this coat/ jacket that I got the pockets are great.

They go all the way in past the wrist with a nice little bit of room to spare in case you have something in your fist like keys.Another thing people pointed out but I don't call it a complaint and I'll explain. But the other thing people didn't like on this coat was the zipper head was on the left. Back in my day men's zippers were on the right and women's on the left. I thought those days were history due to political correctness. But, this zipper head is on the left and it catches me of guard. I'm not going to complain about it because I like that I have to stay on my toes to zip this up. I don't know how many of you people try this once in a while but most people have a set routine dressing themselves.If you put on pants you may put your right leg in first then left and you always do it that way. But if you ever purposefully reverse that it feels awkward as heck.Well, I like reversing things sometimes just to shake things up and re-coordinate. That's how I see this zipper on the left.I love this coat. I like the weight. It gives me confidence is going to keep me warm. I got it a size bigger than i would for a hoody or T shirt because to wear this coat I'm probably going to have extra layers of clothes underneath like a hoody and the size is perfect. It's not too snug and it's not all billowy letting too much air exchange. BTW I'm 6ft and 250 plus pounds and I got the XXXL.

Do *not* choose a size based on what you ""usually"" wear. For instance, I usually wear an overcoat like this in US size XL since I\'m wearing it over sweaters and usually over 2-3 layers. However, as I usually do when buying clothes on Amazon, I checked the sellers sizing chart. I saw that the ""L"" size had a 50.7"" to 51.5"" Chest rating. Bare, my chest size measures US 45-46"" and I\'ll normally order an ""XL"" overcoat that has a 49-50"" Chest rating. So, this time, I ordered the ""L"" size as their chart stated....Perfect sizing!When received it, I tried it on over 3-layers I was wearing. It was easy to put on, even with my arthritis-crippled hands; and, even when zipped, had enough play/looseness to be comfortable sitting or standing without being overly baggy.A couple points of interest for buyers in the US. First, the zipper pulley is US-style on the right-hand side. Some previous buyers stated it was Euro-style on the left, but it looks like they\'ve rectified that for the US market. Second, the button-straps on the cuff, while functional, are decorative in nature. You can button/unbutton them, but there is no second snap for the strap to tighten around the cuffs. The inner elastic cuff is tight enough around the wrists that it shouldn\'t allow any cold wind up the sleeves. There is a third point. The pockets are a *little* bit smaller than what I\'m used to. The upper-chest pockets are a bit tough to fit my fingers into to grab things, but I\'m sure I\'ll get used to it.The coat is shipped in a tight-fitting bag that leaves it wrinkled. If, like me, you have a steamer; just hang it up and it\'s easy to steam out the wrinkles. The pockets, snaps, hood, are all as described/shown.

It does come pretty wrinkled, as some people have said.It is a slim fit item, though the waist is a little roomier than one might expect from a slim fit. I am reviewing the XXL size on this item.If you have a chest that is bigger than 54 inches (Maybe 52 for comfort), then you may not be able to zip this jacket past your pectoral muscles. You will probably be able to zip the waist, but the zipper will stop at your pecs, or your bust for those who identify as female, and you will look like social media models who like to emphasize their bustline in that way.If your biceps are around 16 inches, then your arms will fit in the sleeves, but they will bulge spandex-like, which some people absolutely want, but for others, this is uncomfortable. I would guess that the sleeves can accommodate 18 inch biceps, but Hulk Hogan's 22 inch pythons are probably out. All this is not to be confused with sleeve length, we are talking about bicep circumference here.If you work your shoulders a lot, it will feel tight behind the neck and trapezius muscles, and the way this garment is designed, the space taken up by your traps will be sacrificed by your pecs.Most men with a 54 inch chest will have a 48 inch waist, but if you consistently strength train, then you might have a 46 inch waist or a 44 inch waist, maybe even a 42 inch waist. It gets iffy around the 46-47 inch range for waist size, but again, it depends specifically on how you are shaped.If you wear suits, I would say these sizes are an approximate description of the jacket's fit: 52R, 52L, 54R, 54L.I wear a 56R-56L most of the time at 6 feet tall.

Wrangler has so many different styles and fits that you need to know what you need to get. Ok example Ariat M4 I wear 42x32, on cinch black label same 40x32. Wrangler 20x relaxed 40x32, on the wrangler 13MWZ pre-washed indigo, stoned washed tan and all other washes 44x32 these don’t shrink much. For the wrangler 13MWZ rigid indigo 46x32 they do shrink but not that much. So rigids after the initial treatment they shrink to a 45x31 the only thing if you know the original cowboy cut these are high rise jeans so they go higher up on the waist, the thighs are relaxed but not straight leg, they stack on boots(depending on the stack you want that is how long you get them) I do like stacked jeans but not a lot of material. Because of the larger size I get on these jeans the waist is fine, the length is fine but the thighs feel a little more loose, but I have tried the 44x32 and they feel tight after I shrink and break them in. They are easy to break in for the first wear, this is what I do. Flip the jeans inside out( this is the only way you should be washing jeans)I wash them on the heavy cycle with hot water, then dry them in dryer on hot cycle. Get them out throw them in the washer again same hot cycle, get them out dry again in hot cycle. The first two rounds no laundry detergent the 3 round I add detergent and a dryer sheet on the dryer, I don’t complete the last dryer cycle I take them out after 10 minutes and air dry them. After you do this they are way softer they have shrunk enough and fit way better. So if you want a tighter fit go with your regular size, if you like a little space go up one size. They will shrink just a bit more after that but it is not very noticeable. Ok now that they are ready, wear them a couple of times before you wash them again if they start to smell air them out. If you don’t stink them up go as many wears as you can. Next time you need to wash them flip them inside out zipped them up button them up throw them in the delicate cycle with cold water setting with very little detergent try not to use laundry softener. Take them out of washer and air dry them inside your house, try not to sun dry. If you need to use dryer on an emergency use the lowest setting possible. They last a while and better if you have several pairs on rotation I always have 5-6 pairs on rotation so they don’t get washed often once they need washing I get another 5-6 pairs an start rotation on those. I have pairs that are pretty old.

In my college years I liked the way Levi 501s looked with boots, but didn't like the way the waist sat on me - some no-mans-land between natural waist and hips.I got interested in Wranglers primarily because they did have such a high waist. Of course, the fact that I could buy two pair of the Cowboy Cut jeans for less than a single pair of Levi 501s was exceedingly attractive, especially since I'm still losing weight.They fit well, waist is more or less perfect, thighs are a bit tight, but that's to be expected with such a cut. Only issue is the inseam. All the pants I've ever worn since I was 18 have been with a 34 inseam. Usually they'll be a bit long with bare feet, but with boots, they'll break perfectly and won't bunch up. These are a bit longer and tend to bunch up just the slightest bit. They really oughtn't shrink, either, since they have been sanforized.The material on these is interesting. The Duluth Trading jeans I had been wearing for so long were made of 14.5oz denim. These Wranglers use significantly lighter denim, but it's strange, though. They're definitely thinner, but the material feels substantially denser than any other denim I've worn before. I did go ahead and order a pair of the Wrangler Premium Performance Cowboy Cut jeans to see how the heavier material would turn out. They feel well made and the material most assuredly feels strong and resilient enough.The positioning of the pockets is somewhat important to me. The back two pockets are marvelous, never had rear pockets up that high and it really does help when trying to get your wallet out while sitting down. Front pockets, I'm assuming are meant to be treated as they are on Levi 501s, more or less for aesthetics. I usually just carry my big ol' Samsung Galaxy S4 in the left pocket, forgo a pocket knife (wear one on my belt instead), then tuck my keys and a Zippo into the right pocket. Not an issue, really, they're not cargo pants after all.Even if they somehow turn out to only last me half a year or so, they're very affordable jeans. They're cut really well. My only wish would be to have them available in button fly, but that'd be too perfect.I think I'm somewhere between a 42 and 44 waist right now. I got the 44 on these, as I figured they'd fit tighter than most regular fit jeans. The waist is almost roomy, even after a few washes, but I'm glad I went with 44 because it fits perfectly at my hips and thighs.

The outer material is very soft for faux leather and the overall craftsmanship is very good. I do have a bit of a problem with the sizing however.Here\'s a bit of background for perspective. I\'m 5 foot 11 inches tall, weight 180 pounds, have a short torso, long legs, and a 34 inch waist, all on what is considered to be a small to medium body frame. In other words, I\'m fairly compact for my height and weight. This jacket in size large is way too big on me, though it fits most people of comparable height and weight just fine. For example, I have another coat that I typically layer a hoodie or sweater under, though it still fits well on its own. It is an American size small. This jacket can be worn over that coat and the layer under it while still allowing me to move effectively. The shoulders are too big causing the arms to hang lower and appear too long. The stretch band around the bottom of the jacket makes it want to sit at my waist, and combined with my short torso, causes the material in the midsection of the jacket to bunch up and puff out the back. Suffice it to say, this does not have the most ""fitted"" look on me.That being said, I have decided not to return the jacket. It fits great with layers under it, so I\'m just going to use this one as an overcoat. I am going to get a second one in size small, and update this review accordingly.If you want a fitted look, go with the size you typically get, otherwise, if you want a looser look or just to be sure it wont be too small, go at least one size up. This should be taken with a grain of salt though, as someone with wide shoulders or a long torso might have to go at least one size up just to get a good fit. In short; take all of your body\'s dimensions into consideration, not just height and weight.Update: My size small version came in, and it fits me much better than the large. The arm length is almost perfect and the bottom of the jacket sits just below my belt line. The stomach, back, and shoulders are all a good fit, with not much extra material hanging around. I have found that this jacket does have a design flaw, which is also shared by most other leather jackets. There is little to no extra material in the arm pit area, causing the jacket to pull up if you raise your arms above chest level. This is very common in jackets such as this, so it isn\'t a big deal, at least not to me.Ultimately, this is a very nice jacket, but the sizing can definitely make or break how it looks on you. My final advice to anyone reading this is; do not lie to yourself about your body. If you are a small person and you know it, just go with the size you know fits you best. Likewise, if you are a big person and you know it, go a size up just to be safe. To sum up everything I wrote here in one sentence; I thought I was a medium, so I bought a large, but it turned out that I am a small, and needed a small all along.

I have been wanting to get a nice leather/faux leather jacket for a while and when this was on sale for Cyber Monday I decided to snag it. I got it for $42 instead of the normal $70, which plays into my rating here.1st of all I ordered the Black(heavy) version both because I thought it was the best looking one and because it was the only one on sale, but that IS NOT what I received. I received a Brown one (I think it is the coffee(heavy) one, but not sure). I was going to send it back but my wife said she thought the brown one looked really good on me and since it fits me well enough (always a concern when buying clothes you don't get to try on 1st) I decided to just let it be and keep the brown one. So my rating takes a bit of a hit there.As for fit, I was nervous just because of how inconsistently sized clothes tend to be online. I am 6' tall, about 250lbs with most of my extra size in my stomach/spare tire region. Generally speaking 2XL fits me just right but sometimes with outerwear it's good to buy 1 size up and based on some of the reviews I considered doing that here, but I'm glad that I didn't.The fit is a bit unique but not horrible. The sleeves are a couple inches longer than I expected (probably at least 3XL length) but that is fine because they stay in place with the fabric cuffs at the wrist. It fits just right and exactly as expected in the shoulders and upper chest. It is smaller/tighter than expected covering my stomach(closer to an XL size there). It could stand to be a couple inches longer as it fits just right length wise (again probably XL length) until you move around/bend over/reach up etc... overall the fit is very comfortable when unzipped, and not perfect but acceptable when zipped up.As for the quality it is better then expected for the $42 I paid for it, but would probably just as expecte if I paid the full $70. Sometimes these faux-leather materials can feel/look a bit too plasticky or shiny like vinyl, but this one does not. It's very nice and soft. There are a some loose dangling threads on the stitching which is disappointing but fixable. The 3 buttons that hold the head part of the hood in place seem a bit flimsy and like they aren't stitched into place very securely and after reading some of the other reviews I've come to the conclusion that I'll likely have to replace them eventually. My biggest from a quality perspective however is the zippers, they definitely feel like they are significantly lower quality than the rest of the jacket. I haven't had any problems with them yet but considering that they seem to be the most commonly cited problem in the reviews and the fact that they feel lightweight I'm very worried that they will break down the road, hopefully being extra careful with them will help.Overall I really like this coat a lot, it's comfortable, very warm, and it looks great. It loses 1 star because of getting sent the wrong color, the strange/inconsistent fit, and the poor quality zippers and buttons. None of those issues are bad enough on their own but all together they knock off a star. If you can get this coat on sale it is definitely worth it, but at full price I might look elsewhere."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 13, 2019', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Fits perfect', 'author': 'LENNY A.

Went on Amazon, looked at 3 and decided on this one. I\'m very happy with it. That being said, onto the pros and cons.The Fit: I\'m 5\'5"", 150 pounds. I didn\'t get much information from the reviews left on size, other than ""180 pounds, the X-large fits great"", etc. I\'m 5\'5"" / 150 pounds, 68 years old with the obvious gain around my waist that comes with age, and a few too many beers. Nothing extreme, but I pondered between the small or medium. The size chart is correct, ... I ordered the \'small\', and it fits me perfectly. Sleeve length is perfect, back length is perfect, and I STILL have enough room to wear a sweater under the coat without any problem with movement. Standing upright, the bottom hem of this coat comes down to the end joints of my fingers when arms are by my side. The sleeve cuffs fall just below my wrist, no hindrance in getting into my pockets, ... coat or pants. The medium would have been way to big, cumbersome, and in the way for comfort.The PROS: It\'s warm, as is the collar and hood. Keeps the wind and rain out, and is repellant to showers. Not sure about a \'downpour\' however. The fleece lining is very soft and comfortable, and the weight of the coat itself, while heavier than a fiber filled parka, is very comfortable to wear, even when shopping for a period of time. The fabric is dense but flexible, not like wearing a cardboard box, this coat flexes with you, not against you.The coat buttons are decent, securely sewn in place. The zipper works perfectly, no indication of a ""wrong way zipper"", ... what\'s that about. The inside pocket is deep for a wallet, cellphone, etc.. The side pockets, ... front and side are deep. Might be a problem if one is wearing heavy gloves, otherwise not an issue. The top chest pockets are also a decent size for some extra cash, keys, container of meds and such.I\'ve not found any reason to shoot this coat out of the running, ... but I\'ll offer some attempts.CONS: The waist draw sting could be of a stronger material, ... and the leather \'belt stops\' could be of a locking type of bead, the little leather stop are more to keep the waist draw from moving into the coat. So far, ... that\'s it. I love this coatIf I find some issues pro or con, ... I\'ll update this review.01/20/2024 UPDATE:In temps 35-f and under, ... One really needs a good sweater under this coat.

I wanted only Eddie Bauer because their quality is guaranteed, and many of their jackets can be folded and therefore easy for packing when traveling--like this one. Oddly enough, this jacket is quite similar to another gray one that my son owns, from Eddie Bauer, but this blue one here is lighter in weight. (A bit tricky to the eye--one must examine each coat (the gray and blue one) side by side to make the distinctions in the weight of the fabric.)I still think that this blue one, though advertised as lightweight would be too heavy for an area where the humidity is thick and high, such as the Southern areas of the East coast. Definitely waterproof, thus great for those areas where the rain could be consistent throughout the day.

Again, only going on a bike ride. I have had other coats do this with the zipper teeth this size, but only after years of normal use.I have bought Eddie Bauer products for over 40 years. The quality has always been flawless. I seldom complain about a product unless its truly a problem I can't fix.'When I needed to see about replacing with a new jacket, it was out of the Amazon return policy. Thus I contacted Eddie Bauer directly. What saddens me is that I got a paperwork run around. No matter what paperwork I sent them on proving when and where I bought the product, they just gave me excuses that they needed more, right down to the original sales receipt, amazon order number, pictures, and emails. I finally gave up. I don’t expect any product to always be perfect. But when a company like Eddie Bauer that claims quality as they used to, now makes it hard to return and replace, I lose my respect quickly.So now, I will go to REI, Carhartt or LL Bean.

I was worried that it might come too small, but fortunately a medium fits a 6' ft person pretty well.Some cons is that it might take a while to arrive after ordering (comes from Asia) So no USPS/UPS/FedEx/etc tracking info. But the seller should eventually send you a tracking number via email. The side pockets of the jacket are like a small-medium size.. Don't expect them to be real deep.. still somewhat functional though; good for keeping hands warm, holding keys, and small things. Please note there are also two diagonal zips on the upper chest area of the jacket that zip out, but has no pockets unfortunately; it's just for style.

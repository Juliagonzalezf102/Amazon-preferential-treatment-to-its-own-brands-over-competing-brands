I didn\'t have a problem with them, even though they delivered my dumbbells 2 days after the delivery estimate(can\'t complain, free shipping). Fedex Smartpost sends to the closest USPS, then USPS takes an additional 2 days to deliver. It seems like most people hate Fedex Smartpost because they take longer than usual(""google fedex smartpost sucks"" to see what I\'m talking about). I ordered these on 2-9-13 and they arrived at my doorstep on 2-16-13, so one week exactly, average time for free shipping. The dumbbells came packaged professionally and my case came in perfect condition, which I was very pleased about.I also ordered 60 pound db set from Lion Roar Fitness on 2-8-13, and as of 2-16, they didn\'t even start shipping so I ended up cancelling that order. They charged $20 for shipping too... I will NEVER even consider buying from LRF again. Just wanted to warn you guys about that. $20 for shipping AND they lag it? No thank you.These Dumbbell sets are a great investment, and I know they will last a long time. First of all, there is no toxic chemical smell the negative reviewers mentioned. Not even the case it came with. They clearly have gotten better with quality control. I read ALL of the negative reviews and took a chance with these, and I am glad I did. My bars are all nicely polished, smooth, and the weights and collars fit accordingly. There are 4 pieces of rubber stoppers that help keep these weights in place, 2 in the middle of the bar and 2 that are connected to the collars, which does an excellent job. When you lift weights, you should never ""jerk"" through your workouts, but instead keep good form with nice controlled movements. That\'s how my workouts are, and the weights have not moved, rolled, clanked, at all. The only time the collars roll out, is when I twist them to change weights. I even put all the plates on one bar(30 lbs) and the weights/collars were still in place. People say these are not the best quality, but what more do you expect from a set of dumbbells? Good finish on the plates with a clean tough metal bar, which cannot rip as some rubber grip bars tend to rip after tightening the collars too much. Carefully put the plates on, or you could scratch/chip off the paint. If you don\'t like getting callouses on your hands, I recommend investing in gloves. I don\'t feel a thing with gloves on and can enjoy lifting weights without getting blisters. If you have Fat Gripz(check my review for Fat Gripz), you don\'t even need gloves. Those rubber suckers will cover it, and give you a much better workout.I will buy additional plates for these soon but before you guys do as well, try adding Fat Gripz to the bars with your normal workouts. It will give your workouts more of a challenge, and you will see some good results in your forearm strength. I wish I knew about them when I wrestled in high school..Long story short, don\'t listen to the negative reviews. Keep yourself in shape and buy these already!Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that the bars + collars does not equal 5 pounds(unless you are weighing both bars and 4 collars together). So you get about 17.5 pounds each dumbbell. The description states that they weigh 5 pounds but it\'s half. The case it comes with is about 5 or 6 pounds so that\'s where they kind of trick you. So if you do the math, 4 x 5lbs plate + 4 x 2.5 lbs plate + 2 x 2.5 collars & bar = 35 lbs + 5 lbs case = 40 lbs db set.. I\'m not going to knock off a star for that because I bought these knowing this information. We can always buy more plates, so no big deal.Thank you for reading my long review. I hope this helped make your decision in building a better body!

It's not perfect, but I'm not really sure that the imperfections matter for a product like this. So let's get the negatives out of the way first:- Yeah, they smell, as others have noted. It's nothing strange -- if you've ever been to a gym before, you already know this smell. They're metallic with additional chemical odors. For a basic sniff test, you won't notice much. But the smell does begin to accumulate after a few days in cramped quarters, so maybe they're not the best choice for a bedroom or tiny apartment. I suspect the smell will dissipate in time, but I don't know how long that will be.- The carrying case is cheap molded plastic, and there's a good chance yours will arrive with one or more corners dented. It's fine -- the cases aren't meant to be display items. They're meant to store the weights, and to give you a convenient way to lug them around when needed.- It's obvious that corners were cut in some regards. The rubber cushions on the bars are cheap, and could possibly fall off and get lost if you aren't attentive. Likewise, the rubber cushions within the screw-on collars can fall out. It's not a big deal if they do -- you just stick them back in. But these are obviously not advanced equipment. They were designed to be cheap and functional.That said, I don't think any of these cons really matter. Weights have one purpose in life -- to weigh something. Your muscles can't tell if you're holding twenty pounds of expensive metal or cheap metal. This particular set is very well priced, and they feel safe and sturdy. You don't have to worry about the collars wiggling loose, and they're adjustable down to 2.5 pound increments. I snagged two sets, giving me greater versatility and the ability to put more weight on a single bar if needed. For the price, this is a perfect way to get started with a cheap, space-saving home gym.Weights don't need to be pretty and fancy to work. They just need to give gravity something to act on. You can buy fancier equipment than this, but it's not clear why you'd really want to."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 3, 2014', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Honest review addressing common concerns...', 'author': 'Bleacherbum95', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'When originally considering this product I was very concerned with the number of negative reviews/comments that people were leaving about these dumbbells. After deciding to take the risk, I felt the need to write a review since I believe that the negative reviews are overblown and overly dramatic. I will hopefully address the main concerns that you as the prospective buyer are having while considering this product. If you don\'t care about the details I have a TLDR at the bottom =)1. Smell: These weights do not smells like daisies; no dumbbells do. However, the smell is NOT as bad as people are saying. I would highly recommend leaving these weights outside (and/or washing them) to let them air out and control the smell, but it is not immediately overpowering. When the package arrived I slowly opened the box waiting for a toxic stench to explode out, but it never came. It was not until I lifted a plate out of the box that I noticed the smell people mentioned (the chemical applied to prevent rust), and it was not very strong. I left mine in the garage to air out and noticed a slight change in the smell of the garage, but nothing extreme. I would certainly keep them out of the house to be safe, but for $40 a quick wash or airing out was worth it to me.2: Quality: If you are looking for professional dumbbells that are made of top quality materials then look elsewhere. But if you are looking for a solid set of starter weights, this is your product. I will say that the first time I removed a collar a small piece of metal broke off, but it did not affect the functionality of the piece. Also, I noticed someone mentioned that the collar lets the weights slide...this was incorrect in my experience. The collars seem to hold the weights snugly in place, so there should be no problems there. The quality is by no means great (unbeatable for the price though), but it is good enough that I trust it will last and serve its purpose.3. Case: I saw a few people talking about how the case broke easily. The case seems fairly sturdy if it is treated well. A case breaking or not will depend on your delivery man. The weights are packaged very well inside a few boxes (Amazon ships it out in an excessively large box), and in my experience there were no cracks. The sliders to keep the box closed seem pretty lame, but I\'m one of those people who isn\'t going to sweat it if the case breaks.I hope I covered the main concerns that most people were having. My honest review of this product is that this is unbeatable for the price. $40 with free shipping (mine came in 2 days) is great, and these are exactly what I was looking for. And NO I was not paid for this review and think Amazon should be ashamed of including paid reviews.TLDR: Does NOT smell that bad (easily fixed), decent quality, best bang for the buck for somebody looking for starter dumbbells.UPDATE 1/25/14: I now have two sets of these (it was cheaper than buying weight individually), and they are holding up great after over a year and a half of use. I\'ve noticed the collar shifts slightly when you get over 30lbs, but never enough that it\'s a problem. Be confident in purchasing these as starter weights.UPDATE 7/31/16: My original bars are still going strong. The collar shifting still happens on occasion, but not to the point where it interferes with my workout. I\'ve purchased additional plates for it and added them just fine - any 1"" plate should fit just as well as the originals. So these have held up strong for 4 years...zero complaints here. One thing I forgot in the original review - you may want some lifting gloves. The metals isn\'t forgiving on your hands, so if you don\'t want big calluses, invest in a cheap pair of gloves.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States June 2, 2012', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great Adjustible Weight Set', 'author': 'Lumbre', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'First of all, let\'s get the smell part clear. Yes, it smells. It smells similar to the stuff you find in the tire/automotive aisles at Target/WalMart/other stores. Yes, it can be a bit strong. Let it air for a day and put a dryer sheet in the case when you close it. Problem solved. If you\'re picky on having your home smell like candles or something, these are not for you. If you don\'t even notice the smell of a gym when you\'re in a gym (or aren\'t the quickest to pick up on smells), then you\'re fine. Also, I think it\'s the box that smells, not any of the paint.Pros:*It is easy to add/remove weights. Just unscrew the collars, remove/add weights, screw collars back in. You can do this while resting in less than a minute.*You can add your own weights. When you outgrow these, you can add your own weights (doesn\'t have to be the same brand). Any generic 1"" weight will do.*When I bought these, they were awesome for $40. Under $1/pound if you count the different combinations of weights you can do and that you can add more later.*Cheap compared to buying individually.Cons:*Slight bump in one of the corners of the case. No big deal. Contents inside are fine. Just an aesthetic issue.*Smell. As addressed above, it can be a bit overpowering, but just take the time to let them air out. Some people also do fine by rinsing them.*They\'re not neoprene.Notes & Thoughts:*A lot of people complain about the default California warning added to this set. Seriously, California is overprotective. Drinking dozens of gallons of water is known to cause death. If ingested, gasoline can destroy your organs. Too much sun can give you cancer. They have these warnings on a ton of things for sale in California. Something containing nickel, for example, automatically gets this warning. If it were more serious, more states or the entire country would place a warning or they would be getting sued for giving people cancer (it\'s not like lawyers are exactly shy).*The handles may be a bit too textured for some people, especially those with delicate hands or buying more weights. In that case, maybe you should buy weight-lifting gloves. For those who don\'t mind getting scuffed by sand or falling hands-first on pavement, you\'re fine. If anything, I shift my hands around on the bar which varies up my routine a bit.*People say it\'s a good starter set. I just started a serious workout routine and have had this for a month. I see myself having this for years.*A few have complained that the weights aren\'t exact. The bar doesn\'t seem like 5 pounds, but when I weight myself with one of my 20 lb. dumbbells, I see my weight increase by 19.8 or 20 (my scale goes in intervals of 0.2). It\'s close enough for me. I don\'t need it to be that exact.*Mine didn\'t seem to have any loose seal rings or collars. They seem good for the price. They may shift a small amount after a 30 minute workout to where you can hear a slight clunk.

While most iron free-weights sell for around $2/pound (as of the fall of 2022), this set is much more affordable,The price for it does seem to vary wildly day by day. I paid $77 in October 2022 and see that a month later, it is selling for $65. But I‚Äôm not complaining since it‚Äôs a steal at either price.I bought 2 sets so I‚Äôd have a pair of dumbbells.The dumbbell bars and threaded, star-shaped end nuts are nicely made. The chrome coating seems thick and durable. And because the threaded nuts have black rubber washers on the side that makes contact with the weight plates, they tighten securely and stay firmly in place when in use. Other sets I‚Äôve used did not have the rubber washer and as a result, would loosen up while doing reps. That‚Äôs both annoying and dangerousThe rubber washers do tend to fall off when removing the nuts from the dumbbell, but that is easily rectified by putting a few drops of superglue in the groove in the nut into which the rubber washer sits.The weight plates themselves are a little less precisely made. For instance, I weighed my 5 lb plates on a postal scale and discovered they range anywhere from 4.75 lbs to 5.25 lbs. That‚Äôs not a big deal most of the time but you can definitely notice an imbalance if you inadvertently end up with 8 of the heavier 5 lb plates on one hand and 8 of the lighter plates on the other.To avoid that from happening, I used a silver Sharpie to mark the plate that are over 5 lbs and keep them in a separate pile so I can distribute the weight more evenly into the bars.Also, while the clear-coat on the plates seems heavy duty enough, you do need to check for rough edges. That goes for the dumbbell bars too. I had to file down a couple of spots to avoid getting metal splinters in my hands.Last but not least, the dumbbells I received have a diameter of 1.18 inches (or 30mm) and the weight plates have holes that size. This means any plates you may already have with 1 inch (25mm) holes will not fit onto these bars. Likewise, while the plates from this set will easily go onto a 1 inch bar, they can flop around a bit. In practice the latter is not a problem as long as you can tighten down the bar-end clamps. I use my 30mm plates on a 25mm curl bar without issue.In short, while there may be some compromises involved, at these prices, this dumbbell set is one of the best deals out there.Follow up note written on April 11, 2023:I‚Äôve been using my weight set several times a week for about 6 months now and all parts are holding up great!', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States November 28, 2022', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Really like these', 'author': 'Amazon Customer', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I needed a set to get started with.

In my case, while extremely heavy duty boxes were used, and well taped, one of the boxes was sliced open and minor damage to rubber ends of DBs in that box occurred. Looks like it was slid over something which cut it through.In any event, 2x5, 2x10, 2x15, 2x20, 2x25# DBs are included, making this an excellent ""base"" set. Handles are knurled and as expected in diameter and abrasiveness. No gloves required, but your mileage may vary.Is there a smell? seems to be the burning question. Of course they have a smell. They were just born of chemicals. They smell like what they are: rubber. So if you have ever had a new bike tire in your house, that is the smell, multiplied by a few pairs. It doesn\'t bother me in the slightest, and I was able to start using right away. I cannot relate at all to folks who seemed like they were going to swoon after opening the boxes.NOTE: I ""washed"" these with dish soap and water before using because they are covered in manufacturing residual dust etc. and will make your hands filthy otherwise. Mine did *not* have any kind of oily residues, as others have mentioned; again, just new tire smell, which for me is not obnoxious. But hey- some people think cilantro tastes terrible, so there is no accounting for taste.NOTE #2: Unlike the way Amazon\'s own brand and some other DBs I have purchased are wrapped, these were just loose in the box. No Styrofoam, no placement in a baggie, nada. Just in the box. So they are not going to be 100% brand new and flawless looking when you take them out. Get over it. They\'re dumbbells. They\'ll look like that in a couple months of workouts anyway. Also, because there is no protection, be judicious in opening the boxes.

Having said that, they would still be worth it for the $200 amount too, of course, just slightly less of a bargain.As has been mentioned by other reviewers, the A-frame is easy to put together, but will take your fingers off if you are not watching what you are doing when replacing the weights onto the rack, something which was also true at many gyms I have used and is a bug and not a feature of this style of rack.Definitely recommend, and would purchase again.

I was talking the price up to a buddy the next day and when I checked the price again they had already gone up to $55 for each dumbbell. So if you are in the market for this specific kind of dumbbell I would suggest you make your purchase when they are within a price range of $1 per pound. The price is likely to be based on supply and demand as I can see that many of the lighter weights (higher demand) in some cases are $2 per pound or more. Again though, my specific purchase of the 45lb singles are what we're talking about.Moving on from price, as of this time I have only opened, handled, cleaned, and inspected the dumbbells, they arrived today so this is not a review after multiple months of use but more of a first impressions, unboxing review.Pro's and Con's (you pick) - First impression, great quality, sturdy, nearly identical to what you will find in most fitness clubs/gyms. - They are made in China, says so right on the side of the packaging - Smell, oiliness, staining, and marking (This one takes a little more explaining) I purchased RUBBER encased dumbbells. Synthetic rubber is a byproduct of petroleum products (motor oil, gasoline, etc.) I expected the smell, oiliness, staining, and marking. The smell? If you've ever been near, or worked in a tire shop/center you will recognize the smell, smells like brand new tires (rubber)! If this bothers you you can always clean the dumbbells after you receive them, which is what I did using a little bit of water and Dawn Dish Soap, the exact stuff they use to clean off baby animals after an oil spill (petroleum product). Additionally, you can leave them outside for a monitored period of time in order to off gas some of the remaining petroleum elements that may be causing the smell. I say monitored because like any rubber/metal product left outside the more exposed to the elements (sun, rain, dirt/dust, etc.) the more rapidly it will break down. A clear sunny day would be most appropriate in this case but only for a few hours at a time. Oiliness, staining? Again, rubber is made from petroleum byproducts. During unpackaging of the dumbbells there was some oiliness on the bubble wrap that was protecting them. This residue from the rubber hex heads is expected, I used small amounts of Dawn Dish Soap and water to clean the dumbbells, I also used a white shop rag so I know that my cleaning was effective because of the slight change in color to the rag. It was a dingy white so to be clear it was not a massive amount of oil or staining. Marking? Have you or have you seen someone wear black soled (rubber) shoes on a light colored tile floor or a basketball court? You'll get marks! These dumbbells are really no different, they will mark if you brush a wall while carrying them, drop them aggressively, or drag them across a light colored tile floor...you've been warned! - Knurled handles for extra grip, not overly sharp or aggressive. - Weight...they each way 44.5lbs exactly, on my super-scientific bathroom scale. So either my scale has been lying to me or the dumbbells lost 1/2 lb each in the Metric (Chinese) to Imperial conversion...I'm still happy.I believe these are great quality dumbbells and I would recommend an educated purchase, taking into account my above listed items. Maybe you don't care about the above listed stuff because you know that working out can be inherently dirty, smelly, and non-flattering...great, buy them! If you do care about that stuff, take the extra 5 minutes to clean and treat them and I'm sure you'll be happy, buy them!Down the road if my opinion changes I will absolutely return and update my review...buy them!"", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 28, 2022', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Solid dumbell', 'author': 'ASGIRL', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Just what I wanted in a dumbell, good price, comfortable handle, and fast delivery.

Ever been in a tire shop or worked on cars? That was the smell that washed over me....yikes. Opening up the second just doubled the fun....I saw a few reviews that said wash them in dawn and that will take care of the smell. Nope, did not work. It was still there front and center but hey at least my weights were nice and clean.....looking. We ended up giving them prolonged outside sessions till the smell would at least dial back from a 10 to a 7.One main problem is weighing each dumbbell that were 45lbs each one registered at 44lbs 9oz and the other registered at 46lbs 2oz.

I adjusted for this just by switching weights between hands each set and going from odd sets to even sets but still that is a serious variance.Pro tip: Do not let this hit your walls or drop on hard floors or you will leave black streaks everywhere.I do love the handles.

I will state the simple problems and solutions to each one. I purchased 3 total sets, 50 pound set, 105 pound set, and 200 pound set which cost about $400 total. This is the cheapest and best option to obtaining the most weight as now I have over 360 pounds in total dead weight, 135 per arm, the reason for stating this is because this is absolutely the cheapest solution for the most weight. Now most of the complaints span to roughness of the handle to as ridiculous as giving one star for weight plates being to ""greasy"" upon first opening. The first major issue stated is that the star twist clamp doesn\'t stay tight enough for safe heavy lifting which causes the weight to constantly have to be checked for safety. The first obvious thing is that you should always check your weight for safety no matter if your clamp is tight or not, and I will assure you that if you tighten these clamps and put actual force into it they will stay put, take out the rubber rings if you must as that helps them stick together, for those of you that cannot put so much force than simply twist the last weight plate next to each clamp right and this will tighten it with little effort. The next most complained about is how rough the handle is, and metal splinters are common upon first opening, I will make it clear that I received 3 different sets of handles through my total orders so I know the extent of how rough they may come and honestly if your used to holding a shovel or have used lighter weights than you\'ll be fine, the metal splinter shards that people have stated really are not extreme enough to give these dumbbells one star over, this goes with the greasy weight statement, just have some paper towels like I did or a rag to be prepared to wipe down each weight and handle, I expected to do this even before my first order. When it comes to scraped paint and dents and scrapes in weight plates the scraped paint is minimal and expect to see some of the paint slightly come off when first using and especially upon opening, as for dents there is none, the ""dents"" are just how some come and is expected to see in every type of weight plate, I will show another picture for that. The last issue stated is shipping, know that the 50 pounds ships in 1 box, the 105 ships in 2, and the 200 ships in 3. Some have stated to be missing weights and handles which is really not to be expected so I wouldn\'t worry as I received over 7 packages in my 3 back to back orders and received every part of my order with no issues and received each order in only 3 days with free shipping. These weights are heavy duty and meant to last a lifetime and also not for beginner weight lifters, which is why there are so many negative reviews. These weights are perfect for if you need heavier weight and cannot afford it, do not expect pretty smooth handled easy grip amature weights as these are great for hardcore workouts and great to push you to your limits, and sky rocket your strength, if your truly for lifting than you will be completely satisfied with these weights. I have tried my best to accommodate every question as I wish I had this review when I made my major decision on this big purchase as major insight really eases the mind.

It's a fantastic value for the quality and functionality it provides."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 16, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Almost perfect...', 'author': 'Robert Bidinotto', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'What a bargain!I just bought the 40-lb. Yes4All adjustable dumbbells with the connector bar, which allows the set to be modified into a short barbell. It just arrived this morning, within two days of my order.The set consists of four 5-lb. plates, four 3-lb. plates, two dumbbell bars, four screw-on collars, and the dumbbell connector bar. It was impressively packed. Each piece, wrapped individually in plastic, had its own secure place seated in a flat Styrofoam block. That block sat inside a thick cardboard box, taped shut and tightly wrapped with five plastic binding bands. In turn, that box was tightly enclosed within a second thick-cardboard shipping box.Nothing had shifted or come undone in transit; the set arrived in pristine condition. All the iron plates are in excellent shape, without nicks or coating flaws. The dumbbell bars and connector bar are all strong and gym-quality, as is the optional connector bar, which screws firmly onto the ends of the dumbbells. The plate collars are strong, too, and they screw onto the bars smoothly and tightly.The *only* flaw in the set is extremely minor ( hence my 4-star rather than 5-star rating). Each of the collars has a screw that can be tightened down with your fingers to further secure the collar to the bars. I found that one of those collar screws won\'t tighten in all the way, and another barely so. Because the collars themselves screw tightly onto the bars, I have no worries that the plates will ever fall off the bars during use, even without tightening down those securing screws. Still, it\'s a manufacturing flaw that should have been fixed long ago -- especially since this Chinese company has been producing these sets for years. But in too many cases, ""Chinese quality control"" is an oxymoron. Still, the overall quality of this set is excellent.I\'ve also ordered the Yes4All 60-lb. dumbbell set (the one without a connecting bar), which is yet to arrive. My hope is to combine its 8-lb. and 5-lb. plates with those in this 40-lb. set, then use the connector bar to create a barbell that holds up to 100 lbs. total, for additional versatility in my workouts. I\'ll have to see how many plates that combo arrangement will hold safely and securely. When the 60 lb. set arrives, I\'ll try it out and update this review and that one. However, even without that barbell option, I\'ll be able to prepare the four dumbbells with different weight combinations, so that I won\'t have to waste time to change the plates while working out.In combination with my recent purchase of the outstanding Fitness Reality 1000 Supermax weight bench, I now have a gym-quality weight set in my garage. It will allow me to perform the resistance exercises I need to get back into shape after the closure of my local gym. With a little imagination, I can even attach resistance bands to the bench for additional exercise versatility. Or buy a doorway chin-up bar for about $25.The best thing about these purchases is their low cost. As a Prime member, the entire arrangement -- the excellent Fitness Reality weight bench (which I rated 5 stars), the 40-lb. dumbbell set with connector bar, plus the 60-lb. dumbbell set -- cost me a grand total of only $218.18, including tax. (That price was as of late July 2021.) That\'s about as cheap as you can find for quality home workout equipment. By contrast, a gym membership would cost much more than that in just a few months.So for me, this dumbbell set is a bargain, and the entire combination I\'ve described is a *terrific* bargain. I doubt you\'ll be able to find better value for the price.UPDATE: The additional 60-lb. set, described above, arrived yesterday via UPS. However, both the exterior shipping box and the interior one were badly damaged through rough handling during the shipping process. The contents -- plates, collars, bars -- were all present, but no longer in their protective Styrofoam slots: They were heaped about in a jumbled mess. Most of the plates had superficial scrapes to their finishes, although there was no damage to any of the bars or collars. On the plus side, the securing pins on this set of collars screw all the way in, unimpeded.Overall, I\'m pleased with the purchase, though not the shipping. The additional dumbbell set gives me more versatility in preparing and using dumbbells of different weights during workouts, without the need to waste time changing out plates. As far as I can tell, the Yes4All dumbbells are the least expensive per pound currently available on Amazon, and they are of good quality.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 1, 2021', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent bargain, excellent product.', 'author': 'Chicagorep', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I bought these dumbbells specifically for doing P90X and they are fantastic. If you are considering these because you can't afford, or simply don't want to pay for Ironmasters, Powerblocks, or selecttechs than you found your answer. These dumbbells are an excellent bargain and give you a wide range of weight variety. Now, as for the ability to change weight during a workout, these are no competition compared to the major three adjustables. But do not let this discourage you! The locking screws come off quickly and it doesn't take long to switch the plates in and out once you get your routine down. Not as easy as turning a dial, or pulling a pin, but sufficiently quick. When you consider the price comparison, these are a very good buy. The chrome handles as well as the iron plates are solid as a rock. They feel very sturdy and durable. The locking screws fit tight enough to prevent any rattling what so ever. I have no qualms with these dumbbells at all. They shipped in boxes that didn't hold up well during the shipping process. So be careful picking up the boxes once you have them. But the dumbbells themselves are an excellent product. I give it a full recommendation.::UPDATE::I have been using these for a couple of weeks now and feel the review needs an update. If you are considering these dumbbells for P90X (that's what I use them for) there's a few things to note. While I stand by my comment that changing out the plates is sufficiently fast enough to use them for P90X, it's important to note that time can be a factor for some of the P90X workouts. In particular, the arms and shoulders workout. This routine is almost all dumbbell work and since you switch from shoulders, to biceps, to triceps, you often need a different weight for each one. If you like to follow along with the DVD, you will need to pause from time to time. If you know the routine like I do, it's rather irrelevant. However, I have noticed that it extends the total time for the workout a bit. Some may find this inconvenient if time is a big issue for you. There are some tricks I have developed though. Don't feel that the plates must go in order from heaviest to lightest. I often stack the 2&1/2 pound plates in between the 5 pound ones. This makes it very easy to drop the weight by as much as 10 pounds very quickly. Very useful for myself since my bicep sets tend to be ten pounds lighter than my shoulder sets. It also helps to have some kind of stand to set them on (I use a chair), and keep the plates you know you will need near by and organized. These little tricks can significantly reduce the changing time. Also the dumbbells are a little long for the Cohen curl, a little adjustment will be necessary. I keep me feet spread wider and lean on the wall to prevent unnecessary stress in places I don't want it. Keep in mind that my 5 star review takes the cost into consideration. If cost is not an issue for you, but time and space are. Do yourself a favor and spend the $500 on some Ironmasters. If cost and space are not an issue for you but time is, I recommend getting a full set of dumbbells with a proper stand as that is the absolute best option in my opinion. But if you are like me and cost and space are the biggest issue, you can't really go wrong with these. After some regular use, I would give these dumbbells 4&1/2 stars. However I cannot input a half a star so I will let my five star review stand.

Murphy', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""Just got my pair of 52.5lb dumbbells (purchased individually) and I couldn't be happier! I have read a lot of the reviews and I am sorry to those of you who have had a bad experience, but I have not seen any of the same bad issues with the product. I ordered them on Sunday and received the packages Wednesday virtually unblemished. My biggest worry was that I would receive them in the mail already scratched or chipped. Maybe they changed the packaging from the days of people's reviews of this happening, but mine came all bundled up in Styrofoam and in pristine condition as you can see from the pictures.I purchased these as an upgrade to my Weider adjustable dumbbells of the same style. I had two identical pair of 20lb dumbbells which could be combined for a total weight of 36lbs. I felt like I would need more in the future. I'm sure at 52.5 lbs these are all I will ever need! And what's great is, they adjust in 2.5lb increments which is great for smaller weights for working the weaker muscle groups. Also perfect for gradually working your way up to higher weights.The Weiders did have a baked-on enamel finish which made them much more resistant to chipping than the powder coat paint, but with proper care I'm sure these will hold up just fine in the long run. I live in a 3rd floor apartment so I will only be setting them down gently on carpeted floor. If you have to drop them on the ground you are probably using too much weight in my opinion...My only concern is that the inside diameter of the weights might chip from sliding up and down the threaded bar. But, this is still just cosmetic. They will never be exposed to moisture to where they might rust. And as someone stated in their review, they are meant to be used not looked at. Worst casesenario: I have to touch them up with some powder coat enamel spray paint in the future?The locking nuts on these also have the rubber O-rings, and they are longer than my old ones, which gives them much more grip than my Weiders had. Those would often come loose, just enough to cause them to make noise, which I found annoying. But, these stay nice and snug, even during curls which causes the handles to want to twist loose.As for the price... Absolutely the BEST deal on the market for adjustable dumbbells! So I can't just dial in the weight, I have to take a few seconds to unscrew the caps and change out the plates... Not a big deal. Dial-a-weight dumbbells are exorbitant in price. And if you need the 200lb set then good for you but for my purposes 52.5lbs is perfect for me, and that is by far the best deal. As I said, I purchased 2x 52.5lb dumbells individually without the connected bar. I don't feel like I need or even want the connected bar. I don't have a rack to set it on, plus, I feel like having to balance the dumbbells during exercises will actually make me stronger. I highly recommend buying them in this fashion as it is the most economical. But, like I said, if you are needing the 200lb set then more power to you! Still a good deal. My total cost was $169 with tax and FREE shipping with Amazon Prime! I sold my old set for $100 on Craigslist. So I am sittin pretty for only $70 invested.I also purchased a quality door frame pull-up bar and set of resistance bands (also great deals on Amazon). Now I have all the equipment I should ever need for tackling the P90X! Laugh if you want, but it's perfect for my purposes working out at home in a COVID world. I got it used on eBay for $27, and if it was good 10-12yrs ago, it's still good today in my opinion. I just hit PLAY, follow along on the videos, and in an hour to an hour and a half, I get the best work out I feel like I can get given the time and the space and the convenience. So, if you are in a similar position, I think these dumbbells are the perfect option for you.

Franciscus', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""This is a very sturdy, no frills starter dumbbell set. It comes well packaged, even so there was some minor chipping of the black paint on the cast iron plates but that's to be expected. The set I got comes with 4 5lb cast iron plates, 4 3lb cast iron plates, 2 steel dumbbell handles, 4 steel star collar locks and 1 connector bar (for connecting the dumbbells to each other to form a barbell). I did some weighing of my own and found that the handles (with star collar locks attached) are about 3lbs 14oz, so not quite 4 pounds each side (without any plates). Using the lower set of included weights that makes each side just shy of 10lb, which is fine for my needs but may be too much for someone just starting out. I have been using this set for about 2 months now and have not had any issues, the star collars keep the weights in place with no concern that they'll slide off. I wiped all the pieces down with an old rag as soon as I unboxed them (some reviewers said their set had sharp metal edges that could cause cuts, this was not the case with mine though). The connector bar is ok, takes a bit of getting used to setting up and it's a bit shorter than I'd prefer for bar style exercises but if you don't already have a bar and want a basic option that can save you space this will do the trick. Overall this is pretty much the best value you can find (price per pound) for weight plates, so it's a great deal IMO and I've bought other products from this brand since and will likely continue to do so.

The grip is comfortable and provides a good amount of traction, which is important for preventing slips and accidents during exercise.

However, the convenience of being able to adjust the weight and save on space more than makes up for this.Overall, I highly recommend the Bowflex SelectTech 552 Adjustable Dumbbells for anyone who wants a versatile and convenient way to get a upper-body workout at home.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States March 10, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': ""5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent solution for P90X or those that don't want a house full of weights"", 'author': 'Jacopo', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'After a lot of consideration, I ended up purchasing these weights to use with P90X Extreme Home Fitness Workout Program - 13 DVDs, Nutrition Guide, Exercise Planner . The program calls for a lot of different weights, and I was tired of leaving 8 different dumbbells lying around on the floor of my den. After using these for roughly three months, I am very pleased with them, and with a few exceptions, they work great for P90X.CONSTRUCTION/DESIGN- As of 2/16/10, the model being sold on Amazon is the 2009 model, which came out in September 2008 and is the most current model available. There is no 2010 model, despite what many third party sellers claim (I have confirmed this with Nautilus). I have uploaded pictures of the version Amazon is selling, which comes with a black base plate. Amazon has lumped the reviews from the 2008 model in with this 2009 model, so read the reviews carefully. The 2009 model eliminates many of the complaints of the 2008, most specifically, it uses metal tabs on the weight plates to lock them in place. Construction is solid and it is very unlikely these will break. Although unlike traditional dumbbells, you can\'t drop these on the ground after a set. They are fairly sturdy, but I would be very nervous about dropping these from any height over about 5"". The handle is ergonomic to fit the palm of your hand and the grip feels good and natural during lifting. The handle is thicker than a dumbbell and I prefer it to the thinner dumbbell handles.The weights have a dial on the end of them that you turn to select the desired weight. If you select 10lbs, it will then lock in the two weight plates to make 10 lbs, and release everything else; so when you pick up the weights, you get 10 lbs and all the other weights are left in the base plate. When done, you put the weights back in the base plate. This works very well, with the exception of it ""catching"" occasionally if the weight plates shift a little bit. This happens maybe 1/100 times or so though and isn\'t a big problem. You just jiggle the weights a bit until it locks. The nice thing about this design, is that the two ends of the dumbbell don\'t have to be the same weight. You can set the dial to 10lbs on one end and 30 lbs on the other. This will effectively put 5lbs on one end of the bar and 15lbs on the other. I don\'t do this often, but it can lead to more variation in exercises, and I occasionally do it for tricep workouts or hammer curls. When lifting, the weights feel very sturdy. The plates are firmly locked onto the handle. There is no shaking or movement of the plates at all, and they don\'t feel much different than dumbbells.PRICE - I definitely do not think these are worth the suggested retail price, but then again, I have never seen them sold for anything close to that. While they may seem expensive, if you calculate the cost of a large range of dumbbells (which typically sell for $1 per pound), these are a very favorable comparison. Just two 35lb dumbbells are going to cost you at least $50 (closer to $70 if new).USE WITH P90X - I originally did P90X with dumbbells. I had three different dumbbells, which just isn\'t enough for the variety of exercises used in that program. If money and space is no object, I would recommend a full dumbbell set over these, as dumbbells are better for the exercises. But for most people that just isn\'t practical. I hate pulling out and storing even three sets of dumbbells every other day to workout. The SelectTechs look so good that I just leave them in my den year round.The main advantages the SelectTechs have with P90X is the ability to select smaller weight increment, and being able to make weight changes quickly. Before these I owned a set of 10s, 15s, and 25s, which isn\'t enough variety. Going up from 15 to 25 on bicep curls is a very big jump for me was too light, 25 was too heavy, and my form was terrible because I was struggling with the weight. With the SelectTechs, I could go to 17.5, then 20, then 22.5, then finally to 25. being able to go from 10lbs to 12.5 on tricep exercises, rather than 10lbs to 15 helps significantly. The other advantage is to quickly change weight increments. With P90X, you have about 15-30 seconds to set up for the next exercise. 5-10 seconds is all the time I needed to change the four dials on the SelectTechs and get a new weight.CONS - The real problem with these weights is the length. I had no real problem with the width, which is very manageable, but the dumbbells are 16"" long. This can cause a problem with some of the P90X exercises. There are maybe 7-8 exercises during the entire program that are awkward to do because of the length of the dumbbells. There are about 2-3 exercises that are very awkward to do (to the point that I actually switch to my dumbbells for these). Congdon Curls and Flip Grip Twist Kickback (tricep exercise) are two that I can think of off-hand that are difficult to do. You can ultimately make it work, but it\'s going to feel a little funny as you try to hold the weights out far enough to clear each other or your chest. This isn\'t enough of an issue that it would discourage me from buying them again.I originally debated between getting these and the Bowflex SelectTech 1090 Single Dumbbell , since I was worried 52.5 pounds wouldn\'t be enough. Even though there are a few exercises where you could eventually need more than 52.5 pounds (heavy pants and lawnmowers come to mind), I really think this is enough weight for 90% of the people who will be doing P90X. And as Tony says, if you don\'t have heavy enough weight, you can always add reps. I would not buy the 1090s (which go up to 90 lbs) for P90X because I think the length of those, which is even bigger than the 552s), would just be too unwieldy for many of the exercises.The SelectTechs did come with a short DVD that shows you some workouts specifically designed for these dumbbells and how to use them. I did find this beneficial since it gave me some tips that I didn\'t know about lifting. Optionally, I bought the Bowflex SelectTech 552 / 1090 Dumbbell Stand to use with these. It looks great, but I\'m not sure I would buy it again. If you don\'t care about looks, the box the SelectTechs are shipped in makes a great stand on it\'s own and is very sturdy.UPDATE June 2012 - I\'ve put these weights through an estimated 200+ hours of heavy use since I\'ve had them and they still look brand new and work just the same as when I got them. There are times when I want heavier weights and would have liked some dumbbells that go up to 90 lbs, but I don\'t want to sacrifice the smaller profile of these for the larger model. Still very satisfied.UPDATE November 2013 - I\'m still using the SelectTechs almost daily. They are in almost identical condition to when I received them with no signs of wear or problems. I have not found a better solution for adjustable dumbbells yet and will continue to use them (although I do wish they were slightly smaller).UPDATE November 2016 - Still using the SelectTechs, albeit about bi-weekly since I have switched my fitness regimen. I would say they have close to 1000 hours of use and are still in almost brand new condition, and still working great. I have recently switched to the Selecttech 560s though and will be finally retiring the 552s.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 16, 2010', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Bowflex - the best choice!

I started lifting weights to...don't laugh...improve my golf game. I love a bargain, but I love a great value even more, and I'll pay for the most expensive choice if it's worth it. When I decided to get some adjustable dumbbells, I started digging into the details. See below for the brands I considered and the pros and cons in my opinion. I only reviewed the ones I was able to try with my own hands (mainly a used or new sporting goods store or friends' places). Bottom line: the SelectTech 'bells provide the most bang for the buck and are the best choice by a wide margin! [note after editing - my columns disappeared but you will get the idea]Brand PROS CONSCap Barbell 40-Pound - Dirt cheap! - Take a long time to adjust - Lift like traditional 'bells - Cheap chrome finish - Indestructible - drop 'em! - Useless cheap case - Add-on plates easy to findBottom line: I once owned some similar to this, and hardly ever used them except for at a single weight, because they were such a pain to adjust. If it's all you can afford, not bad for $40.PowerBlock Personal Trainer - Nice range of weights - Pricey, weird shape and form - Solid construction - HUGE, very tricky adjustment - What is that idiotic color coding?Bottom line: Tough, well made, and feel good in your hands. Not droppable but solid. I can't get past the blocky, bulky form factor of these 'bells however. They hit me in the chin on curls, rows are impossible, they touch your wrists sometimes, and don't even think about anything behind your head! The adjustments are difficult and just plain won't work unless the unit is level on a solid surface (not carpet!). A no go.Ironmaster 75 lb Quick Lock - The most weight - Big bucks - The most solidly built - Hard to adjust, pins precarious! - Good size, feel right - Lose the square corners!Bottom line: By far the most solid and traditional feeling of the adjustable 'bells; I dropped them several times and they didn't break, but the pins fell out when I did! Very expensive, but the only way to get to 100+lbs in each hand (with add on kit) in this segment. The stand is adequate. The corners are annoying and got in the way sometimes. Among the most difficult to adjust. If they were round, and had easy to adjust, secure pins, they would be a winner. But they don't. Fail.Bowflex SelectTech - BY FAR easiest to adjust - Pricey - Solid (= to powerblocks) - Seem a bit looser than others - Excellent size and form - 2.5-lb increments up to 25 lbs are superbBottom line: The smoothest, fastest to adjust, nicest feeeling of all. The grip is just the right firmness and size, the plates aren't bulky, and while they feel a bit rattl-ey, they aren't! Actually these had the most secure adjustments except the star-locks on the Cap Bells (which take so long they defeat the purpose). These also benefit from an elegant level of finish, like a Lexus among Kias. And while they aren't cheap, they are #3 on the price list of my review (out of 6). The clear winner!Lifesmart 5- to 55-Pound - Inexpensive - Junk construction! - Unique (?) - Difficult to adjustBottom line: A weird set...the handle holds the plates from the outside, making the whole 'bell unbalanced unless hanging down in your hand. So cheaply made they feel like toys. Pesky pins to adjust; this seems to be a bad solution in general! I mention them only to advise you to avoid! Terrible product.Proform Pro Quick 100-Pound - Fair price - Worthless stand - Good dumbbell feel - Feel cheapBottom line: These use an adjustment mechanism similar to the Bowflex 'bells: dials at the ends. The increments are wider, though, and I could feel how the cheap plastic bits on the insides were near breaking (I was trying a used set). Nothing like the Bowlex's solid clunk of metal parts on the inside. Don't be swayed by the included stand, it's crap and won't last 3 months. Definitely not a good value.Others: I stopped after 6. There seem to be several products similar to the Proforms, maybe even exactly the same manufacturer! I could tell at a glance that they're all equally cheap. If money is a big limiting factor, I suggest you go with the Cap Bells until you can afford the good stuff.If you read this far, thanks, and enjoy whichever one you buy!"", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 16, 2010', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Going on 10 years, still like new; cannot recommend enough', 'author': 'Skeegz', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I bought these in January of 2013. Not a week has gone by that these things did not get some use, usually at least 3x per week, often a lot more. If it wasn\'t me using them, it was one of the many roommates, friends, and family members who have lived with me over the years. I used them back when me and some friends were doing the p90x; they\'ve been a part of pretty much every exercise routine I\'ve ever used in the past 10 years; I often use them in between gaming sessions or while waiting through loading screens; friends often mess around with them casually when they come over; I\'ve lent them out for brief periods for friends who wanted to try them out.Honestly, after 10 years of hard, constant use, they still look and feel brand new to me. It\'s absolutely ridiculous.When I first got them, I worried that I was making an expensive impulse purchase, and that they would gather dust in the corner or break after a few years. In the years since, I frequently look back and think to myself, ""that was probably one of the best purchases I\'ve made.""I\'ve never had any issues with the weights, and they\'ve never failed on me. They\'re extremely easy to use and are indispensable for workouts. Adjusting the weights is still as smooth and as simple as the day I first purchased them, and to me the clicking sound that the adjusting process makes is an oddly satisfying noise.They\'re small and don\'t take up much space. They\'re easy to move if you can lift 55 lbs (a little more than a kitty litter bucket), and the base has what feels like handholds on all four sides. Hell, you can even stack them and carry them two at a time, or store them on top of each other.The biggest con I can think of is that they\'re a bit bulky when you\'re using them, so they might be a little unwieldy for some exercises. Never bothered me that much, though. Maybe the fact that you have to adjust both sides of the dumbbell might be a little cumbersome, but honestly that\'s being very nit-picky.I\'ve recommended these to so many people over the years, and I can\'t praise them enough.

So let‚Äôs get down to it...-These dumbbells were packaged well. They are encased in very thick styrofoam blocks which is inside of a very thick cardboard box. The dumbbells themselves have a plastic bag around them and they are fastened to the dumbbell base with a strap. Overall, very pleased with how they are shipped. Nothing was broken so A+ to Bowflex, Amazon, and UPS.-Easy to operate right out of the box. It‚Äôs all fairly self explanatory. There are two knobs, one on each end of the dumbbell. You turn the knobs to the desired weight setting and lift straight up on the dumbbell. That‚Äôs it. You don‚Äôt need to try to figure out any weight plate combinations in your head. You just turn the knobs on each end to the desired weight. As an added bonus you can do an ‚Äúoffset‚Äù dumbbell. You simply set one knob for a specific weight (20lbs for example) and set the opposite knob for a different weight (7.5lbs for example). Using the dumbbells in ‚Äúoffset‚Äù mode can be beneficial in certain exercises. Bowflex goes into greater detail about ‚Äúoffset‚Äù in the owners manual. This is not something you can do with traditional dumbbells.-Operation is smooth. The knobs turn very easily and give a distinct/solid ‚Äúclick‚Äù when the knob is in the correct position. Lifting the dumbbells out of the base and putting them back in is easy.-The handles are great! They have a grippy section that makes them feel very secure in your hands. And there is plenty of room to grab the handle. It doesn‚Äôt feel cramped (I mention this because some of the pictures I‚Äôve seen make it look like there‚Äôs not a lot of room)-The plates are the only area where I have a couple of very, very small complaints. First, they do shift slightly as you are using them during exercises. I‚Äôve never felt like they were going to disengage from the handle but there is a slight movement of the weight plates during curls/presses/etc. I‚Äôm used to using solid, old school dumbbells so the movement of the plates is just something I will need to get used to. The second small complaint is the overall width of the dumbbells. In order to accommodate all of the weight plates the dumbbells have to be wide. I understand that. And I HAVE NOT whacked myself in the head while using these BUT it feels like they get very close to my head on certain exercises (shoulder press, shoulder flies) and on other exercises (upright rows for example) they almost... almost... get in the way of themselves. Again, this is just a small complaint and wouldn‚Äôt stop me from recommending them.-The weight range is phenomenal. I mean, come on. To be able to have the equivalent of 30 dumbbells ranging from 5-52.5 lbs and be able to tuck them neatly away in the corner somewhere?? Yeah. That‚Äôs a HUGE advantage of these dumbbells, which leads me to...-A GREAT VALUE! You are getting the equivalent of 30 dumbbells with this set. $350 divided by 30 dumbbells equals $11.67 per dumbbell. With dumbbell prices currently hovering somewhere near $2 per pound you would have to spend over $1500. Even if prices go back down to $1 per pound these are still an amazing bargain.-Extra stuff... they come with a 2 year warranty (make sure you keep your proof of purchase), a really nice, well written owners manual that explains the previously mentioned ‚Äúoffsetting‚Äù and gives you instructions on several exercises to try. They come with a nice, solid base that has hand holds at each end so they are very easy to move. They‚Äôre made by Bowflex so you know you‚Äôre going to get a quality product AND quality support should you ever need it.-Overall I‚Äôm very happy with these dumbbells. Would highly recommend. Thanks for reading this review! I hope you found it helpful!**Edit - I had a dumbbell ‚Äúfreeze‚Äù during my second workout. It wouldn‚Äôt release from the base. Panicked a bit until I looked it up on YouTube and found out how to fix it. This has only happened once and I‚Äôve removed/replaced them from the base multiple times during the two workouts in which I‚Äôve used them. At this point I‚Äôm still very pleased with them and my rating won‚Äôt change unless this freezing issue keeps recurring. Also, I added a photo of the dumbbell on a scale to show the accuracy of the weight.Edit (9-8-2021): These continue to be my go to dumbbells after several months of use. It‚Äôs just very convenient to twist a knob and have a weight range from 5-52.5 lbs. They are still a little tricky to remove from the base occasionally but it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve gotten used to. No major problems at all. I‚Äôve been using them 5 days a week for several months now and would still recommend them to anyone looking for a solid set of adjustable dumbbells.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States April 16, 2021', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars In love with the product, in depth review of the best dumbbells', 'author': 'Prakhar Rawat', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'I recently purchased a set of Bowflex SelectTech Dumbbells and I have to say, I am thoroughly impressed with their performance and versatility. As someone who values convenience and efficiency in my workout routine, these dumbbells have been a game-changer for me.One of the standout features of the Bowflex dumbbells is their adjustable weight system. With just the turn of a dial, I can easily switch between a range of weights, from 5 pounds all the way up to 52.5 pounds. This not only saves me time and space (I no longer have to clutter my home gym with multiple sets of dumbbells), but it also allows me to progressively increase the intensity of my workouts as my strength improves.In addition to their adjustable weight system, the Bowflex dumbbells are also incredibly durable and well-made. The handles are comfortable to grip and the weights themselves feel solid and secure. I have never had any issues with them slipping or sliding during my workouts, which is a huge plus.Another advantage of the Bowflex dumbbells is their versatility. With a single set, I can perform a wide variety of exercises, from bicep curls and tricep kickbacks to shoulder presses and rows. This not only keeps my workouts interesting and varied, but it also allows me to target multiple muscle groups and achieve a more well-rounded physique.Since incorporating the Bowflex dumbbells into my workout routine, I have noticed significant improvements in my strength and endurance. I feel more energized and motivated to stick to my exercise plan, and I am seeing tangible results in terms of muscle definition and overall fitness.All in all, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase of the Bowflex SelectTech Dumbbells.

I‚Äôve been considering buying these dumbbells for a while and waited until I got a good deal on them. You will definitely want two of these fantastically engineered babies in your home‚Äîif not for the convenience, then at least to marvel at them. I‚Äôve already done several workouts, all of which could technically be unilateral, but it‚Äôs so convenient to have two DBs. Whenever I‚Äôm exercising and only doing unilateral training, I keep one on a ‚Äúlow‚Äù weight, and the other on a heavier weight. Absolutely fantastic.This tool is an absolute feat of engineering. If you‚Äôre at ALL interested in product design... I recommend buying one of these just to witness the design thinking. I could go on and on about the plates, the adjustable knob (which locks once you pick the dumbbells up, absolutely NO chance of loosening that thing), and the mathematics that went into calibrating each side.What really gets to me is that the top of the dumbbell also acts as a safety so that a plate doesn‚Äôt accidentally fall on you. So for instance, if you‚Äôre doing chest presses, you‚Äôll naturally pick it up where the red plastic is. Once you invert the dumbbells upside down, the plates are now sustained by the rod, and not just by the locking mechanism.Not that the plates would fall‚Äîthey‚Äôre pretty secure‚Äîbut if one of them somehow loosens up, they won‚Äôt just fall directly on your face.These dumbbells are, of course, bigger than the typical ones at the gym. It takes some getting used to, but not so much that it‚Äôs disruptive.Bonus: The plates you leave behind can also be used as free weights. I‚Äôve already used them as ‚Äúmedicine balls,‚Äù only they‚Äôre not ball-shaped.My one true gripe has to do with the packaging. It‚Äôs tough to protect such a heavy item, so I understand using the white foam material, but that poses a problem if you have children or pets. When unpacking the dumbbells, you‚Äôll have white particles and white foam EVERYWHERE, which can pose a risk for an overly curious toddler or a dog. I recommend unpacking in a closed garage where you can easily sweep and where the wind won‚Äôt blow the foam everywhere.

A good texture on metal would have been a lot better. The final issue I have with it is I'm never a big fan of putting something above my head that is being held together by plastic especially when it comes to weights. As you can see in the photo that is attached the plates that actually hold the weights are a plastic, the weights have a little chunk of metal that holds in the grooves on this plastic. Metal against plastic always wears out the plastic and the idea of having something like that above your head is a little bit concerning. The reason I change my rating from a three to a four is because in the picture that red plastic that says Bowflex on. If you make sure this logo is always down when you're doing anything above your head the open side of the weights would also be facing down making it impossible for the weights to fall off.

If you've ever shopped for dumbbells you know they are outrageously expensive and run in a whole litany of varieties, sizes, reliability, etc. What I decided on were rubbers as they had the most durability in the setting of our garage and they would also be the most space-effective. These 10lbs and 15lbs are a bread-and-butter for warming up, doing light shoulder work, arm work, etc. so they needed to join the gym as quickly as possible.The dumbbells themselves are exactly what you would expect from any hexagonal dumbbells. They don't slide around on the floor, they sit nicely when placed down, they are sturdy, and pretty darn close to being weight accurate (see pictures). It should be expected that these dumbbells will not weight the exact weight purchased as they are not calibrated to that level. A rule of thumb I always tell her, and suggest in any gym; rotate your dumbbell each set to ensure any imbalances are evened out.My girlfriend has been using them weekly since December and has never run into any issues or complaints about the grip or the weight. I would highly advise you leave them in a place with airflow for a few days though--these will smell terrible out of the box because of the plastic, as mentioned by many of the other reviewers.Overall you simply cannot beat this value though.

Almost immediately, I ordered a cable machine but still felt like I was missing a bunch of exercises.4 months later, in July of 2020 I found these and ordered what I could -- at that time only 10 & 20 pounders were available. That order was just shy of $95. Expensive but seemed like a somewhat fair trade given that I had cancelled my gym memberships, not knowing what was going to happen or for how long places would remain closed.They trickled in as they could over the next month.I would check the site daily to see if any more had become available for sale. Most of the time they would come with a warning, stating that there were none in stock but would be shortly and charges would appear on CC until they were shipped. I'd pick up a pair as I saw them available.April of 2021 (almost a year after I purchased my first pair), I bought the elusive 50 and 35 pound pairs. The last two I needed to complete the 10 - 50 pound set (incremental by 5lbs).THE DUMBBELLSHIIT, being able to switch weights instantly to finish a set out to complete failure, flies and reverse flies, single arm lifts for core strength, etc. Nothing beats the versatility of a good dumbbell set.Yes, some were oily and had a rubbery smell when they first arrived. I would cut the box top, remove from the plastic bag and let air outside for a couple of days. I'd then wipe down with a cloth and place on dumbbell rack. These two things were never really an issue for me.After a year and a half of almost daily use, they look and feel as they did when I first got them. Please note, that I follow gym etiquette. I don't let them slam against the floor (drop), I don't bang them against each other, I re-rack when done, etc. The highest they ever dropped is from bench after doing chest press (will drop lower my arms by my side and l and these roll off -- as anyone would at any gym). They do fall on mats, or carpet. They've never dropped on concrete, brick, rock, or similar.Take care of them, and THEY WILL LAST you forever.WEIGHTThere are a few reviews that tested the weight to verify how close they were to their stated weights. I haven't checked mine. Honestly, up until I started to write this review I hadn't even thought about it. I'm no professional body builder. I need resistance and these seem to be doing a very good job at it. Maybe if I get a calibrated scale in the future I'll weigh 'em and update this review (but doubtful)."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 19, 2022', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great quality', 'author': 'Matthew Staller', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Great feel in the hand, knurling is medium light.

I didn\'t have a problem with them, even though they delivered my dumbbells 2 days after the delivery estimate(can\'t complain, free shipping). Fedex Smartpost sends to the closest USPS, then USPS takes an additional 2 days to deliver. It seems like most people hate Fedex Smartpost because they take longer than usual(""google fedex smartpost sucks"" to see what I\'m talking about). I ordered these on 2-9-13 and they arrived at my doorstep on 2-16-13, so one week exactly, average time for free shipping. The dumbbells came packaged professionally and my case came in perfect condition, which I was very pleased about.I also ordered 60 pound db set from Lion Roar Fitness on 2-8-13, and as of 2-16, they didn\'t even start shipping so I ended up cancelling that order. They charged $20 for shipping too... I will NEVER even consider buying from LRF again. Just wanted to warn you guys about that. $20 for shipping AND they lag it? No thank you.These Dumbbell sets are a great investment, and I know they will last a long time. First of all, there is no toxic chemical smell the negative reviewers mentioned. Not even the case it came with. They clearly have gotten better with quality control. I read ALL of the negative reviews and took a chance with these, and I am glad I did. My bars are all nicely polished, smooth, and the weights and collars fit accordingly. There are 4 pieces of rubber stoppers that help keep these weights in place, 2 in the middle of the bar and 2 that are connected to the collars, which does an excellent job. When you lift weights, you should never ""jerk"" through your workouts, but instead keep good form with nice controlled movements. That\'s how my workouts are, and the weights have not moved, rolled, clanked, at all. The only time the collars roll out, is when I twist them to change weights. I even put all the plates on one bar(30 lbs) and the weights/collars were still in place. People say these are not the best quality, but what more do you expect from a set of dumbbells? Good finish on the plates with a clean tough metal bar, which cannot rip as some rubber grip bars tend to rip after tightening the collars too much. Carefully put the plates on, or you could scratch/chip off the paint. If you don\'t like getting callouses on your hands, I recommend investing in gloves. I don\'t feel a thing with gloves on and can enjoy lifting weights without getting blisters. If you have Fat Gripz(check my review for Fat Gripz), you don\'t even need gloves. Those rubber suckers will cover it, and give you a much better workout.I will buy additional plates for these soon but before you guys do as well, try adding Fat Gripz to the bars with your normal workouts. It will give your workouts more of a challenge, and you will see some good results in your forearm strength. I wish I knew about them when I wrestled in high school..Long story short, don\'t listen to the negative reviews. Keep yourself in shape and buy these already!Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that the bars + collars does not equal 5 pounds(unless you are weighing both bars and 4 collars together). So you get about 17.5 pounds each dumbbell. The description states that they weigh 5 pounds but it\'s half. The case it comes with is about 5 or 6 pounds so that\'s where they kind of trick you. So if you do the math, 4 x 5lbs plate + 4 x 2.5 lbs plate + 2 x 2.5 collars & bar = 35 lbs + 5 lbs case = 40 lbs db set.. I\'m not going to knock off a star for that because I bought these knowing this information. We can always buy more plates, so no big deal.Thank you for reading my long review.

It's not perfect, but I'm not really sure that the imperfections matter for a product like this. So let's get the negatives out of the way first:- Yeah, they smell, as others have noted. It's nothing strange -- if you've ever been to a gym before, you already know this smell. They're metallic with additional chemical odors. For a basic sniff test, you won't notice much. But the smell does begin to accumulate after a few days in cramped quarters, so maybe they're not the best choice for a bedroom or tiny apartment. I suspect the smell will dissipate in time, but I don't know how long that will be.- The carrying case is cheap molded plastic, and there's a good chance yours will arrive with one or more corners dented. It's fine -- the cases aren't meant to be display items. They're meant to store the weights, and to give you a convenient way to lug them around when needed.- It's obvious that corners were cut in some regards. The rubber cushions on the bars are cheap, and could possibly fall off and get lost if you aren't attentive. Likewise, the rubber cushions within the screw-on collars can fall out. It's not a big deal if they do -- you just stick them back in. But these are obviously not advanced equipment. They were designed to be cheap and functional.That said, I don't think any of these cons really matter. Weights have one purpose in life -- to weigh something. Your muscles can't tell if you're holding twenty pounds of expensive metal or cheap metal. This particular set is very well priced, and they feel safe and sturdy. You don't have to worry about the collars wiggling loose, and they're adjustable down to 2.5 pound increments. I snagged two sets, giving me greater versatility and the ability to put more weight on a single bar if needed. For the price, this is a perfect way to get started with a cheap, space-saving home gym.Weights don't need to be pretty and fancy to work. They just need to give gravity something to act on. You can buy fancier equipment than this, but it's not clear why you'd really want to."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 3, 2014', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Honest review addressing common concerns...', 'author': 'Bleacherbum95', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'When originally considering this product I was very concerned with the number of negative reviews/comments that people were leaving about these dumbbells. After deciding to take the risk, I felt the need to write a review since I believe that the negative reviews are overblown and overly dramatic. I will hopefully address the main concerns that you as the prospective buyer are having while considering this product. If you don\'t care about the details I have a TLDR at the bottom =)1. Smell: These weights do not smells like daisies; no dumbbells do. However, the smell is NOT as bad as people are saying. I would highly recommend leaving these weights outside (and/or washing them) to let them air out and control the smell, but it is not immediately overpowering. When the package arrived I slowly opened the box waiting for a toxic stench to explode out, but it never came. It was not until I lifted a plate out of the box that I noticed the smell people mentioned (the chemical applied to prevent rust), and it was not very strong. I left mine in the garage to air out and noticed a slight change in the smell of the garage, but nothing extreme. I would certainly keep them out of the house to be safe, but for $40 a quick wash or airing out was worth it to me.2: Quality: If you are looking for professional dumbbells that are made of top quality materials then look elsewhere. But if you are looking for a solid set of starter weights, this is your product. I will say that the first time I removed a collar a small piece of metal broke off, but it did not affect the functionality of the piece. Also, I noticed someone mentioned that the collar lets the weights slide...this was incorrect in my experience. The collars seem to hold the weights snugly in place, so there should be no problems there. The quality is by no means great (unbeatable for the price though), but it is good enough that I trust it will last and serve its purpose.3. Case: I saw a few people talking about how the case broke easily. The case seems fairly sturdy if it is treated well. A case breaking or not will depend on your delivery man. The weights are packaged very well inside a few boxes (Amazon ships it out in an excessively large box), and in my experience there were no cracks. The sliders to keep the box closed seem pretty lame, but I\'m one of those people who isn\'t going to sweat it if the case breaks.I hope I covered the main concerns that most people were having. My honest review of this product is that this is unbeatable for the price. $40 with free shipping (mine came in 2 days) is great, and these are exactly what I was looking for. And NO I was not paid for this review and think Amazon should be ashamed of including paid reviews.TLDR: Does NOT smell that bad (easily fixed), decent quality, best bang for the buck for somebody looking for starter dumbbells.UPDATE 1/25/14: I now have two sets of these (it was cheaper than buying weight individually), and they are holding up great after over a year and a half of use. I\'ve noticed the collar shifts slightly when you get over 30lbs, but never enough that it\'s a problem. Be confident in purchasing these as starter weights.UPDATE 7/31/16: My original bars are still going strong. The collar shifting still happens on occasion, but not to the point where it interferes with my workout. I\'ve purchased additional plates for it and added them just fine - any 1"" plate should fit just as well as the originals. So these have held up strong for 4 years...zero complaints here. One thing I forgot in the original review - you may want some lifting gloves. The metals isn\'t forgiving on your hands, so if you don\'t want big calluses, invest in a cheap pair of gloves.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States June 2, 2012', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great Adjustible Weight Set', 'author': 'Lumbre', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'First of all, let\'s get the smell part clear. Yes, it smells. It smells similar to the stuff you find in the tire/automotive aisles at Target/WalMart/other stores. Yes, it can be a bit strong. Let it air for a day and put a dryer sheet in the case when you close it. Problem solved. If you\'re picky on having your home smell like candles or something, these are not for you. If you don\'t even notice the smell of a gym when you\'re in a gym (or aren\'t the quickest to pick up on smells), then you\'re fine. Also, I think it\'s the box that smells, not any of the paint.Pros:*It is easy to add/remove weights. Just unscrew the collars, remove/add weights, screw collars back in. You can do this while resting in less than a minute.*You can add your own weights. When you outgrow these, you can add your own weights (doesn\'t have to be the same brand).

Under $1/pound if you count the different combinations of weights you can do and that you can add more later.*Cheap compared to buying individually.Cons:*Slight bump in one of the corners of the case. No big deal. Contents inside are fine. Just an aesthetic issue.*Smell. As addressed above, it can be a bit overpowering, but just take the time to let them air out. Some people also do fine by rinsing them.*They\'re not neoprene.Notes & Thoughts:*A lot of people complain about the default California warning added to this set. Seriously, California is overprotective. Drinking dozens of gallons of water is known to cause death. If ingested, gasoline can destroy your organs. Too much sun can give you cancer. They have these warnings on a ton of things for sale in California. Something containing nickel, for example, automatically gets this warning. If it were more serious, more states or the entire country would place a warning or they would be getting sued for giving people cancer (it\'s not like lawyers are exactly shy).*The handles may be a bit too textured for some people, especially those with delicate hands or buying more weights. In that case, maybe you should buy weight-lifting gloves. For those who don\'t mind getting scuffed by sand or falling hands-first on pavement, you\'re fine. If anything, I shift my hands around on the bar which varies up my routine a bit.*People say it\'s a good starter set. I just started a serious workout routine and have had this for a month. I see myself having this for years.*A few have complained that the weights aren\'t exact. The bar doesn\'t seem like 5 pounds, but when I weight myself with one of my 20 lb. dumbbells, I see my weight increase by 19.8 or 20 (my scale goes in intervals of 0.2). It\'s close enough for me. I don\'t need it to be that exact.*Mine didn\'t seem to have any loose seal rings or collars. They seem good for the price. They may shift a small amount after a 30 minute workout to where you can hear a slight clunk.

While most iron free-weights sell for around $2/pound (as of the fall of 2022), this set is much more affordable,The price for it does seem to vary wildly day by day. I paid $77 in October 2022 and see that a month later, it is selling for $65. But I‚Äôm not complaining since it‚Äôs a steal at either price.I bought 2 sets so I‚Äôd have a pair of dumbbells.The dumbbell bars and threaded, star-shaped end nuts are nicely made. The chrome coating seems thick and durable. And because the threaded nuts have black rubber washers on the side that makes contact with the weight plates, they tighten securely and stay firmly in place when in use. Other sets I‚Äôve used did not have the rubber washer and as a result, would loosen up while doing reps. That‚Äôs both annoying and dangerousThe rubber washers do tend to fall off when removing the nuts from the dumbbell, but that is easily rectified by putting a few drops of superglue in the groove in the nut into which the rubber washer sits.The weight plates themselves are a little less precisely made. For instance, I weighed my 5 lb plates on a postal scale and discovered they range anywhere from 4.75 lbs to 5.25 lbs. That‚Äôs not a big deal most of the time but you can definitely notice an imbalance if you inadvertently end up with 8 of the heavier 5 lb plates on one hand and 8 of the lighter plates on the other.To avoid that from happening, I used a silver Sharpie to mark the plate that are over 5 lbs and keep them in a separate pile so I can distribute the weight more evenly into the bars.Also, while the clear-coat on the plates seems heavy duty enough, you do need to check for rough edges. That goes for the dumbbell bars too. I had to file down a couple of spots to avoid getting metal splinters in my hands.Last but not least, the dumbbells I received have a diameter of 1.18 inches (or 30mm) and the weight plates have holes that size. This means any plates you may already have with 1 inch (25mm) holes will not fit onto these bars. Likewise, while the plates from this set will easily go onto a 1 inch bar, they can flop around a bit. In practice the latter is not a problem as long as you can tighten down the bar-end clamps. I use my 30mm plates on a 25mm curl bar without issue.In short, while there may be some compromises involved, at these prices, this dumbbell set is one of the best deals out there.Follow up note written on April 11, 2023:I‚Äôve been using my weight set several times a week for about 6 months now and all parts are holding up great!', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States November 28, 2022', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Really like these', 'author': 'Amazon Customer', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I needed a set to get started with.

GET THESE from the beginning!"", 'author': 'wannabe perfectionist üí¨', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""The media could not be loaded. I have several dumbbells at home for my teenager sons. I have the fixed 5lb, 10lb, 15lb dumbbells as well as dumbbells that you can add or remove weight plates to change the weight. However, they end up taking too much valuable space in my home gym and worst of all, my sons get lazy with changing weight plates, not to mention changing it back after using it. So they end up using the fixed dumbbells more often but they got to the point where they now need the 20lb dumbbells so I was looking for one in the market and came across this wonderful, adjustable dumbbells that can be adjusted from 5lb to 25lbs in 5 pound increment and I'm so glad I found this because they are simply amazing!First of all, I was so impressed with their packaging. It just has 2 pieces (dumbbell and plate) but both of them were well protected with thick, fitted foams so they don't move or get damaged with bumps and drops. It also came with a poster size user manual and it had pictures of various exercise you can do with the dumbbells on the back of it.I never had an adjustable dumbbell before but this is so cleverly designed. You can literally change the weight in 1 second by simply rotating the handle bar while the dumbbell is on the plate. There's clear marking of the weight from 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 on both ends of the handle with an arrow to indicate which weight has been selected. It also makes a clicking sound when you rotate the handle so you know when the change has been set and locked in. Very clear, quick and easy way to change the weight. It really can't get any easier, simpler and faster!I was a bit worried that the dumbbell weight plates might come loose or fall off when exercising but I was again impressed that the plates stays in place and you can't even rotate the handle to change the weight once the dumbbell comes out from the plate. The handle has non-slip grip and is well shaped for comfortable and solid grip. It seems everything is made out of high quality material.Finally, I just love the space saving feature and now I can get rid of all our fixed dumbbells. No more clutter or misplacing or even adding/removing weight plates. Just turn the handle to set the dial then lift to start working out. In fact, I get grab both dumbbells and change the weights at the same time on both of them. It's that easy! Although I was looking for 20lb dumbbells for my teenager sons, I'm happy that this can be used up to 25lbs, which I'm sure they will need eventually. What's so crazy is that the price of this dumbbell is actually cheaper than all of my fixed dumbbells. This is just a no-brainer!BOTTOM LINE:Don't make the same mistake that I made when buying dumbbells. Just buy this adjustable dumbbell from the beginning and save yourself time, money, and space! This is truly amazing and impressive dumbbells that is cleverly designed. I highly recommend this adjustable dumbbells without any reservation. 10 out of 5 stars!

Because that type of weight can feel cold and rough, and if you only get the heavy ones you may view them as hard to get started/motivated. The point of getting weights is to use them, not to buy and feel macho looking at them sitting in the corner, while they collect dust.These weights come in a variety of sizes and colors, they are very attractive and feel good in your hands. I bought the 8 pounds (each) red and the 12 pounds (each) blue. The reds are nice to get started in your workout, if you are a man you\'ll likely find them easy but that\'s the point - they get you started easily, they don\'t intimidate you or make you feel like they will be an ordeal. After starting with a low weight like the reds, you can move to the blues or whatever you want, however you want. I would guess that women will want to start at much lower weights than the 8 pound reds, and fortunately those are available too at great prices and attractive colors.I found the weights to be nicely finished, though there were some minor spots where I chose to sandpaper them down slightly to be even smoother. I wouldn\'t say that this is necessary but you might want to consider doing it. If they made some 16 lb dumbells I might consider buying them too, but as of now I\'m very satisfied with the 8\'s and 12\'s. They do have some nice looking 15\'s (forest green) but I\'m not sure those are enough of a bump up from the 12\'s to be worthwhile for me, and the 20\'s would be too heavy for what I want.

After using them for a few weeks, I'm happy with their function, and I'm only disappointed by the lack of extra plates to extend their weight range.The whole set is metal-- not plastic or coated or weirdly fake-feeling. So you feel like you're actually lifting metal (which you are). The shiny finish on the plates might wear off some, but I don't mind.Adding and removing plates with the screw-nut is smooth and easy and doesn't take too much time during my workout. The nut threads easily and is easy to spin on with your finger. The little rubber gaskets will probably wear out and fall off, but since everything is metal, the gaskets are nice, but not necessary.As others have noted, the grips are a little rough on the hands. I wear lifting gloves, but fingertips (and feet if you're using them for leg stuff) feel the sharp edges. I hope that will eventually wear down.The max weight you can get from the set is 17.5 per dumbell if you're using both, or 32.5 on one. I'd like to find additional 5lb plates so that I could theoretically get up to 42.5 on each. Not that I need that much now, but I have found myself wanting more than 17.5 when using both, and I would imagine that any 5lb plate with that diameter could work.Lastly, the case.

I know I for sure won't be outgrowing 33 lbs per arm anytime soon! üòÑIt does pretty much what you'd hope/expect for it to. Works well in both the dumbbell and barbell configurations. Screwing the parts together can take a bit of time due to the lengths of the threads, especially if you only put the minimum number of weights, but that's the tradeoff you get for them securely combining.If you torque the wingnut holding in the weights solidly finger tight, it doesn't come loose or acquire any slack through regular use. If you use your hands to specifically try to rotate the weights while they're locked in, they can rotate in place, but again it's not something that's going to happen while you're normally using them.It came with all the advertised weight amounts. I'm by no means an expert in packaging a lot of heavy weights, but it seemed to be packaged well. Each plate was wrapped individually in a foam sheet, and none of them took any damage in shipping, despite the box looking like it'd seen things. However one of the wingnuts had been cracked. Fortunately not in any way that affects its functional integrity, but I'd imagine it's not impossible for that to happen either.

Either u have 5.5kg, 11kg, or 16.5kg increments. Which is an awkward number.When using it as barbells, the max you can put on each side when you want adequate space for your hands is 2.75 x 6 so 16kg (35lbs) . If u try to make it look like 2 dumbbells connected together for 22-30kg you can use more weights but the handle bar space will be more cramped so your hand positions are limited if you want wider stance. Esp if u want to place it on ur traps.I thought it would be great to use them as dumbells but the length of the handles are too long so its poking on the side and makes my position awkward as well (ex when doing overhead presses, the side of the handle sticking out will poke your head or sides of ur body because its too long)I thought i could also do it for goblet squats style but its too thick when the plates are stuck together and awkward to hold so not that either.

See below for best way to handle problems.Rationale for 3-star rating: 2 for the product (b/c of missing part) but 4 for the service, so 3 so far.Problem: All the weight plates came, but no dumbbell handles.Confirming the handles should have been in the order:I confirmed that the Amazon add mentioned handles.Also, there were four dumbbell plate locking nuts in the package, so there would be no reason for those unless they had intended to send handles.There were three options for fixing the problem: The BalanceFrom telephone number, the BalanceFrom site, and Amazon chat. The telephone number said they could not accept calls and disconnected me. The BalanceFrom site was okay, but said it might be several days before anyone replied. The Amazon chat started with a bot which didn't work out because the bot never understood that I was missing a piece of the order. When I tried again, I (think) I got a real person who handled the matter quickly and with nothing more for me to do, so that was a relief. I should get what is needed in 9-13 days, so we shall see!So I recommend the Amazon chat if you have a problem.If the matter gets resolved, I think I can update my rating.UPDATE: The replacement arrived with several large holes in the box that were big enough for the handles or locking nuts to fall out, but fortunately, they had not and all was intact. So the matter was resolved by Amazon, although my separate inquiry with the company created a series of inconclusive and repetitive exchanges , requests for information, etc. Overall, this is settled and my experience further confirms the wisdom of buying through Amazon and getting problems settled through Amazon, rather than directly via vendors on Amazon. I updated my rating to 4, as the plates seem nicer than the average cement/plastic plates. BTW, the handles are plastic but I own metal and plastic dumbbell handles at home and I actually prefer the plastic because the knurling is more comfortable, it is easier to repair the screw threads should they get knicked, they don't scratch your skin as much should they hit your leg while curling (home dumbbell kits have long handles compared to gym dumbbells, and b/c they are lighter to travel with, should I want to bring handles and resistance bands with me."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 7, 2021', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Delivered on time and nice set easy to set up.', 'author': 'Amazon Customer', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Easy of set up and use.

For example no 15lbs 25lbs 35lbs etc. You are only supposed to do whole numbers. Technically you could still do the 15lbs, 25lbs etc. The only thing is each dumbbell would be uneven with weight.

A couple of years ago, I finally found some that you could adjust by rotating the handle but there were so many bad reviews that I held off a little longer. Glad I did! The sliding bolt on these is a perfect solution. Fast and easy to adjust the weights.I read the reviews stating that plates slide off and was scared of purchasing. I'm glad that I did finally end up getting them.

I don't do bench exercises with them (ie: press or flies), nor do I press or roll them on the ground (ie: DB pushup into single arm row). I have a hex DB set and rack for all of that in the garage. I mainly use these for a quick set of full body exercises a few times throughout the day. It's a good excuse to get up and away from the computer. I'll do a few push ups, DB rows, a few crunches, then stand up for shoulder press, curls, and overhead tri extensions. Then I'll max them to 50 and hold for grip/forearm burn. Sit back down and do a couple of hours of work before repeating that circuit. I usually get in 3 to 5 of these sets by the end of day.Makes it a lot easier, having these behind me. No more need to go to garage (over 105f in there), and have to switch out the dumbbells, etc. So much easier to spin chair around, get up, do set. Drop DBs into holder, quickly switch weights, pick up, do reps, and so on until set/circuit is complete.Don't slam them, don't drag them on floor/mat/carpeting, treat them as if you were using them on a second floor apartment and don't want to make noise for tenant below, and these should last you a lifetime."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2022', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Great for female lifters', 'author': 'Hannah', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'I combed reviews for Bowflex adjustable weights and many of the competitors looking for a set of adjustable weights that wouldn‚Äôt be bulky for me as a 5‚Äô2‚Äù female.

They would have got here 3 days earlier but there was a few days delay due to the weather I am guessing.I am pretty pleased with this purchase. These 12LB Pair Neoprene Amazon Basics Dumbbells are at a VERY affordable price in comparison to other weights around the internet. That must explain why these Amazon Basics Neoprene Pair Dumbbells have over 90,000 reviews averaging 4.8 stars out of 5 stars. These Amazon Basics Neoprene Pair Dumbbells truly are‚Ä¶ the only value for your money online I would say. The quality seems to be there too. I would say‚Ä¶ these are a GREAT purchase!The Black color Neoprene is‚Ä¶ Black; the color is true. The Neoprene provides a comfortable grip for those people with softer hands and for people with rougher hands as well.I do not have a weight scale (I apologize everyone). So I am unable to verify the EXACT weight of both of these 12LB Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells. But I will say this‚Ä¶ I am 32 years young, played football, served Active Duty in the U.S. ARMY, I am 5‚Äô9 and weigh in between 225-240lbs (around 215lbs during my time in the U.S. ARMY) and I have been strength training since I was 16 years old CONSISTENTLY and TRULY (I Love training). I have Benched Pressed 335lbs, Deadlifted 455lbs for 3 reps, Squatted 655lbs, Dumbbell Pressed the 140lb Dumbbells, Leg Pressed 1,000lbs maybe a little more, and I have curled a little over 140lbs on the curl bar (two 45 plates one on each side and two 25lb plates one on each side). So I have some credibility in judging weights on how they feel without a scale. And I can truly say that these 12LB Pair Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells do feel around (if not true) to 12LBS. Because I was using 10LB Neoprene Dumbbells from Reebok for MONTHS! And I CAN FEEL THE SLIGHT WEIGHT INCREASE in comparison to the previous Reebok 10LB Neoprene Dumbbells; especially when I am doing light at home shoulder work (train shoulders safely for good health and longevity muscles break quicker than iron most times). And these Amazon Basics 12LB Neoprene Dumbbells feel GREAT and I really like them! I have the 20LB Pair Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells coming tomorrow (Wednesday January 3rd, 2023) I placed that order on Friday December 29th, 2023 and those ran out of stock and I am getting those this fast and quickly! -Impressive! So when they have these in stock, they come quickly! -AND FOR A GREAT TRULY UNBEATABLE PRICE! So purchase them while you are able to. If you want them, purchase them quick because they might be temporarily out of stock. But Amazon restocks them fairly quickly. As you can see from my review details on when I placed the order for mine and received mine in about one week timeframe. And that was with delays like: weather, and being temporarily out of stock.On to the size and how they feel in your hands (depending on hand size). I have fairly larger hands; almost 8 inches tall from my wrist, to the tip of my middle finger. And with my hands spread wide open, my hands measure 9 inches from the end of my thumbs, to the end of my pinky fingers. And when I grip these 12LB Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells I have a snug grip. These 12LB Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells in comparison to the 10LB Reebok Dumbbells that I was using are‚Ä¶ ‚Äústubbier‚Äù I would say in comparison to the 10LB Reebok Dumbbells I was previously using (I purchased these Amazon Basics ones because they are an exact matching pair the Reebok ones were a mismatch). -BUT! Even though these 12LB Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells are‚Ä¶ ‚Äústubbier,‚Äù in comparison to the previous mismatched 10LB Reebok Dumbbells I was using. I still REALLY like these Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells because they fill my hands, and there is no wasted space in between my hands and the handle of the 12LB Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells. -AND‚Ä¶ the Amazon Basics ones match! So now I have EXACT weight distribution instead of constantly switching hands to even out the weight distribution in each arm due to the Reebok ones being a 10LB mismatch (their shape is different got mixed up sometime in the past). These 12LB Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells are: compact, and they feel AT ONE with my body. There is no ‚Äúslack‚Äù in the feeling when I use these 12LB Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbell‚Äôs.The hexagon pattern in these Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells are very nice as you would expect, and they stack very well when you store them after your workout. They can also make a good transportable dumbbells to workout with if you are road tripping somewhere and you want to have the opportunity to get in a quick workout, you can throw these in a duffle bag (a sturdy one) and take them with you somewhere to workout when you want to. I‚Äôm unsure about taking them with you on an airline; you may have to call the airlines for that clarification so you don‚Äôt risk getting them possibly confiscated, but if you are driving and you want to take these Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells with you, you can do that!The white ‚Äú12LB‚Äù labeling on these Black Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells (the 12LB versions) are easy to identify due to the good use of color contrast; the white colored numbering ‚Äú12LB‚Äù on these Black Amazon Basics 12LB Dumbbells are easy to identify‚Ä¶ and‚Ä¶ that was redundant.As for the durability of these Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells, I am confident; and I think you will feel confident that these will be able to withstand normal use in your workouts. And if you drop your weights (although safely controlling the weight down is a far wiser option) I am confident and you will feel confident that these Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells WILL HOLD in the durability department.Thank You for reading my review of these GREAT VALUE FOR YOUR MONEY Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells (PAIR)!Now if you will excuse me, I am going to workout with these now‚Ä¶ and if you‚Äôre thinking about making the purchase as I was, I am confident that you will be satisfied and find value in your purchase so you can train better and more effectively and efficiently.Thank You again for reading my review of the Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells (PAIR)! God Bless You.UPDATE: Hi people! Today is Wednesday January 3rd, 2024 and I just received my Green 20LB Amazon Basics Neoprene Pair Dumbbells! THEY ARE SOLD AS A PAIR! And as I Love the 12LB Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells I also LOVE these 20LB Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells! THEY ARE SOLD AS A PAIR! And at a VERY AFFORDABLE PRICE! And the quality is FANTASTIC! Mine came with a slight scuff mark from something before I purchased and received it as my own; whatever that was.But I Love these 20LB Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells! They are Big compared to the other smaller Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells; not overly big, just‚Ä¶ 20LBS big! They feel very nice in my larger hands I have nice comfortable room to grab onto and fill my hands. They stack very nice in place and won‚Äôt take up alot of room depending on how you stack and store them before your next workout / training session.I like how these Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells have a underline that goes underneath the numbers so you don‚Äôt get confused if you are lifting 6 or 9 pound dumbbells. So I really appreciate Amazon putting that white underline underneath the numbers so you don‚Äôt get confused trying to identify if your 6 pound dumbbell is a 9 pound dumbbell and vice versa. I really like how clearly labeled the weight is on these Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbell Pairs are. They are exactly like this: 12LB, 15LB, 20LB, etc: it makes identifying your weights alot easier and faster.I only intended to ‚Äújust‚Äù get the 12LB Pair Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells. But‚Ä¶ I like them so much because they are sold as a pair and that the price is SO AFFORDABLE I got the 20LB ones‚Ä¶ and after I just received my 20LB Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells today (Wednesday January 3rd, 2024)‚Ä¶ I went and just bought the 15LB pair as well for my at home shoulder training workouts and training sessions.Overall these Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells are a GREAT BUY! DO NOT WAIT! BUY THEM IF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT IT! Because after you shop around these Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells are a GREAT DEAL! Very affordable in comparison to just 1 dumbbell from another place you might shop around for. And plus‚Ä¶ the reviews and very high ratings speak for themselves.UPDATE: Hi everyone! I am writing this update today (Tuesday January 9th, 2024). I received my 15LB Pair Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells yesterday (Monday January 8th, 2024) and they arrived with the scheduled arrival time (Between 6:00 PM - 9:00 PM). And They are great! I like them. I don‚Äôt have a scale so I am unable to provide the exact weight to see if they are exactly 15LBS but they feel it though.These 15LB Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells I received are‚Ä¶ ‚Äúthe most defective‚Äù out of the 3 Pairs I received. Very minor though, and I am going to share with you all what those 2 minor things are: The first minor defect is there are a few very tiny Neoprene holes that didn‚Äôt get filled in. You wouldn‚Äôt notice though unless you VERY CLOSELY inspected the product as I did. And the second minor defect I‚Ä¶ ‚Äúfelt‚Äù was that one of the 15LB Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells in the handle has a‚Ä¶ oval shaped feel, rather than a full round handle shape feel as all of my other Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells do. And that‚Äôs all. Still a good valuable purchase though. I‚Äôm not trippin too hard about it but I wanted to point those out to you.I already threw the box away, and I don‚Äôt feel like exchanging them for a NEW set of 15LB Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells. Who knows‚Ä¶ maybe I should though since I am using these as a long term investment. Maybe I should just make it perfect. We‚Äôll see.Other than that the hexagon shaped pattern is perfect! The grip feels good, I have a little more space innthe handle with the 15LB Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells kind of like the 20LB pair. Now I am straight for training, lifting, and exercising during the winter with good, safe, full, complete shoulder workouts and more during this cold season.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 3, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great value', 'author': 'Anton', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""Great set offering great great value.

This was a pleasant surprise because I actually wanted them to be a different color than my black dumbbells so it would be easier to identify them at quick glance. But if you wanted black these are not it. I like the fact that they have the hex shape so they don‚Äôt roll. The handle is a little bit thicker than the other ones that I have which I haven‚Äôt decided if I like or not. It might be more of a problem if you have a very petite hand. I like the fact that the number on the end is large and clearly identifies the weight at quick glance. My only complaint is that the neoprene coating was done a little bit sloppy and there‚Äôs a bunch of ridges and wrinkles and one of them but not the other. Not a dealbreaker but quality control could be a little better for that. Overall happy for the price and these were the least expensive ones I found for a pair.

The weight plates are also well-made and fit securely onto the handles, so there's no need to worry about them coming loose.Another great thing about this set is the versatility it offers.

I didn\'t have a problem with them, even though they delivered my dumbbells 2 days after the delivery estimate(can\'t complain, free shipping). Fedex Smartpost sends to the closest USPS, then USPS takes an additional 2 days to deliver. It seems like most people hate Fedex Smartpost because they take longer than usual(""google fedex smartpost sucks"" to see what I\'m talking about). I ordered these on 2-9-13 and they arrived at my doorstep on 2-16-13, so one week exactly, average time for free shipping. The dumbbells came packaged professionally and my case came in perfect condition, which I was very pleased about.I also ordered 60 pound db set from Lion Roar Fitness on 2-8-13, and as of 2-16, they didn\'t even start shipping so I ended up cancelling that order. They charged $20 for shipping too... I will NEVER even consider buying from LRF again. Just wanted to warn you guys about that. $20 for shipping AND they lag it? No thank you.These Dumbbell sets are a great investment, and I know they will last a long time. First of all, there is no toxic chemical smell the negative reviewers mentioned. Not even the case it came with. They clearly have gotten better with quality control. I read ALL of the negative reviews and took a chance with these, and I am glad I did. My bars are all nicely polished, smooth, and the weights and collars fit accordingly. There are 4 pieces of rubber stoppers that help keep these weights in place, 2 in the middle of the bar and 2 that are connected to the collars, which does an excellent job. When you lift weights, you should never ""jerk"" through your workouts, but instead keep good form with nice controlled movements. That\'s how my workouts are, and the weights have not moved, rolled, clanked, at all. The only time the collars roll out, is when I twist them to change weights. I even put all the plates on one bar(30 lbs) and the weights/collars were still in place. People say these are not the best quality, but what more do you expect from a set of dumbbells? Good finish on the plates with a clean tough metal bar, which cannot rip as some rubber grip bars tend to rip after tightening the collars too much. Carefully put the plates on, or you could scratch/chip off the paint. If you don\'t like getting callouses on your hands, I recommend investing in gloves. I don\'t feel a thing with gloves on and can enjoy lifting weights without getting blisters. If you have Fat Gripz(check my review for Fat Gripz), you don\'t even need gloves. Those rubber suckers will cover it, and give you a much better workout.I will buy additional plates for these soon but before you guys do as well, try adding Fat Gripz to the bars with your normal workouts. It will give your workouts more of a challenge, and you will see some good results in your forearm strength. I wish I knew about them when I wrestled in high school..Long story short, don\'t listen to the negative reviews. Keep yourself in shape and buy these already!Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that the bars + collars does not equal 5 pounds(unless you are weighing both bars and 4 collars together). So you get about 17.5 pounds each dumbbell. The description states that they weigh 5 pounds but it\'s half. The case it comes with is about 5 or 6 pounds so that\'s where they kind of trick you. So if you do the math, 4 x 5lbs plate + 4 x 2.5 lbs plate + 2 x 2.5 collars & bar = 35 lbs + 5 lbs case = 40 lbs db set.. I\'m not going to knock off a star for that because I bought these knowing this information. We can always buy more plates, so no big deal.Thank you for reading my long review.

It's not perfect, but I'm not really sure that the imperfections matter for a product like this. So let's get the negatives out of the way first:- Yeah, they smell, as others have noted. It's nothing strange -- if you've ever been to a gym before, you already know this smell. They're metallic with additional chemical odors. For a basic sniff test, you won't notice much. But the smell does begin to accumulate after a few days in cramped quarters, so maybe they're not the best choice for a bedroom or tiny apartment. I suspect the smell will dissipate in time, but I don't know how long that will be.- The carrying case is cheap molded plastic, and there's a good chance yours will arrive with one or more corners dented. It's fine -- the cases aren't meant to be display items. They're meant to store the weights, and to give you a convenient way to lug them around when needed.- It's obvious that corners were cut in some regards. The rubber cushions on the bars are cheap, and could possibly fall off and get lost if you aren't attentive. Likewise, the rubber cushions within the screw-on collars can fall out. It's not a big deal if they do -- you just stick them back in. But these are obviously not advanced equipment. They were designed to be cheap and functional.That said, I don't think any of these cons really matter. Weights have one purpose in life -- to weigh something. Your muscles can't tell if you're holding twenty pounds of expensive metal or cheap metal. This particular set is very well priced, and they feel safe and sturdy. You don't have to worry about the collars wiggling loose, and they're adjustable down to 2.5 pound increments. I snagged two sets, giving me greater versatility and the ability to put more weight on a single bar if needed. For the price, this is a perfect way to get started with a cheap, space-saving home gym.Weights don't need to be pretty and fancy to work. They just need to give gravity something to act on. You can buy fancier equipment than this, but it's not clear why you'd really want to."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 3, 2014', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Honest review addressing common concerns...', 'author': 'Bleacherbum95', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'When originally considering this product I was very concerned with the number of negative reviews/comments that people were leaving about these dumbbells. After deciding to take the risk, I felt the need to write a review since I believe that the negative reviews are overblown and overly dramatic. I will hopefully address the main concerns that you as the prospective buyer are having while considering this product. If you don\'t care about the details I have a TLDR at the bottom =)1. Smell: These weights do not smells like daisies; no dumbbells do. However, the smell is NOT as bad as people are saying. I would highly recommend leaving these weights outside (and/or washing them) to let them air out and control the smell, but it is not immediately overpowering. When the package arrived I slowly opened the box waiting for a toxic stench to explode out, but it never came. It was not until I lifted a plate out of the box that I noticed the smell people mentioned (the chemical applied to prevent rust), and it was not very strong. I left mine in the garage to air out and noticed a slight change in the smell of the garage, but nothing extreme. I would certainly keep them out of the house to be safe, but for $40 a quick wash or airing out was worth it to me.2: Quality: If you are looking for professional dumbbells that are made of top quality materials then look elsewhere. But if you are looking for a solid set of starter weights, this is your product. I will say that the first time I removed a collar a small piece of metal broke off, but it did not affect the functionality of the piece. Also, I noticed someone mentioned that the collar lets the weights slide...this was incorrect in my experience. The collars seem to hold the weights snugly in place, so there should be no problems there. The quality is by no means great (unbeatable for the price though), but it is good enough that I trust it will last and serve its purpose.3. Case: I saw a few people talking about how the case broke easily. The case seems fairly sturdy if it is treated well. A case breaking or not will depend on your delivery man. The weights are packaged very well inside a few boxes (Amazon ships it out in an excessively large box), and in my experience there were no cracks. The sliders to keep the box closed seem pretty lame, but I\'m one of those people who isn\'t going to sweat it if the case breaks.I hope I covered the main concerns that most people were having. My honest review of this product is that this is unbeatable for the price. $40 with free shipping (mine came in 2 days) is great, and these are exactly what I was looking for. And NO I was not paid for this review and think Amazon should be ashamed of including paid reviews.TLDR: Does NOT smell that bad (easily fixed), decent quality, best bang for the buck for somebody looking for starter dumbbells.UPDATE 1/25/14: I now have two sets of these (it was cheaper than buying weight individually), and they are holding up great after over a year and a half of use. I\'ve noticed the collar shifts slightly when you get over 30lbs, but never enough that it\'s a problem. Be confident in purchasing these as starter weights.UPDATE 7/31/16: My original bars are still going strong. The collar shifting still happens on occasion, but not to the point where it interferes with my workout. I\'ve purchased additional plates for it and added them just fine - any 1"" plate should fit just as well as the originals. So these have held up strong for 4 years...zero complaints here. One thing I forgot in the original review - you may want some lifting gloves. The metals isn\'t forgiving on your hands, so if you don\'t want big calluses, invest in a cheap pair of gloves.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States June 2, 2012', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great Adjustible Weight Set', 'author': 'Lumbre', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'First of all, let\'s get the smell part clear. Yes, it smells. It smells similar to the stuff you find in the tire/automotive aisles at Target/WalMart/other stores. Yes, it can be a bit strong. Let it air for a day and put a dryer sheet in the case when you close it. Problem solved. If you\'re picky on having your home smell like candles or something, these are not for you. If you don\'t even notice the smell of a gym when you\'re in a gym (or aren\'t the quickest to pick up on smells), then you\'re fine. Also, I think it\'s the box that smells, not any of the paint.Pros:*It is easy to add/remove weights. Just unscrew the collars, remove/add weights, screw collars back in. You can do this while resting in less than a minute.*You can add your own weights. When you outgrow these, you can add your own weights (doesn\'t have to be the same brand). Any generic 1"" weight will do.*When I bought these, they were awesome for $40. Under $1/pound if you count the different combinations of weights you can do and that you can add more later.*Cheap compared to buying individually.Cons:*Slight bump in one of the corners of the case. No big deal. Contents inside are fine. Just an aesthetic issue.*Smell. As addressed above, it can be a bit overpowering, but just take the time to let them air out. Some people also do fine by rinsing them.*They\'re not neoprene.Notes & Thoughts:*A lot of people complain about the default California warning added to this set. Seriously, California is overprotective. Drinking dozens of gallons of water is known to cause death. If ingested, gasoline can destroy your organs. Too much sun can give you cancer. They have these warnings on a ton of things for sale in California. Something containing nickel, for example, automatically gets this warning. If it were more serious, more states or the entire country would place a warning or they would be getting sued for giving people cancer (it\'s not like lawyers are exactly shy).*The handles may be a bit too textured for some people, especially those with delicate hands or buying more weights. In that case, maybe you should buy weight-lifting gloves. For those who don\'t mind getting scuffed by sand or falling hands-first on pavement, you\'re fine. If anything, I shift my hands around on the bar which varies up my routine a bit.*People say it\'s a good starter set. I just started a serious workout routine and have had this for a month. I see myself having this for years.*A few have complained that the weights aren\'t exact. The bar doesn\'t seem like 5 pounds, but when I weight myself with one of my 20 lb. dumbbells, I see my weight increase by 19.8 or 20 (my scale goes in intervals of 0.2). It\'s close enough for me. I don\'t need it to be that exact.*Mine didn\'t seem to have any loose seal rings or collars. They seem good for the price. They may shift a small amount after a 30 minute workout to where you can hear a slight clunk.

While most iron free-weights sell for around $2/pound (as of the fall of 2022), this set is much more affordable,The price for it does seem to vary wildly day by day. I paid $77 in October 2022 and see that a month later, it is selling for $65. But I‚Äôm not complaining since it‚Äôs a steal at either price.I bought 2 sets so I‚Äôd have a pair of dumbbells.The dumbbell bars and threaded, star-shaped end nuts are nicely made. The chrome coating seems thick and durable. And because the threaded nuts have black rubber washers on the side that makes contact with the weight plates, they tighten securely and stay firmly in place when in use. Other sets I‚Äôve used did not have the rubber washer and as a result, would loosen up while doing reps. That‚Äôs both annoying and dangerousThe rubber washers do tend to fall off when removing the nuts from the dumbbell, but that is easily rectified by putting a few drops of superglue in the groove in the nut into which the rubber washer sits.The weight plates themselves are a little less precisely made. For instance, I weighed my 5 lb plates on a postal scale and discovered they range anywhere from 4.75 lbs to 5.25 lbs. That‚Äôs not a big deal most of the time but you can definitely notice an imbalance if you inadvertently end up with 8 of the heavier 5 lb plates on one hand and 8 of the lighter plates on the other.To avoid that from happening, I used a silver Sharpie to mark the plate that are over 5 lbs and keep them in a separate pile so I can distribute the weight more evenly into the bars.Also, while the clear-coat on the plates seems heavy duty enough, you do need to check for rough edges. That goes for the dumbbell bars too. I had to file down a couple of spots to avoid getting metal splinters in my hands.Last but not least, the dumbbells I received have a diameter of 1.18 inches (or 30mm) and the weight plates have holes that size. This means any plates you may already have with 1 inch (25mm) holes will not fit onto these bars. Likewise, while the plates from this set will easily go onto a 1 inch bar, they can flop around a bit. In practice the latter is not a problem as long as you can tighten down the bar-end clamps. I use my 30mm plates on a 25mm curl bar without issue.In short, while there may be some compromises involved, at these prices, this dumbbell set is one of the best deals out there.Follow up note written on April 11, 2023:I‚Äôve been using my weight set several times a week for about 6 months now and all parts are holding up great!', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States November 28, 2022', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Really like these', 'author': 'Amazon Customer', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I needed a set to get started with.

In my case, while extremely heavy duty boxes were used, and well taped, one of the boxes was sliced open and minor damage to rubber ends of DBs in that box occurred. Looks like it was slid over something which cut it through.In any event, 2x5, 2x10, 2x15, 2x20, 2x25# DBs are included, making this an excellent ""base"" set. Handles are knurled and as expected in diameter and abrasiveness. No gloves required, but your mileage may vary.Is there a smell? seems to be the burning question. Of course they have a smell. They were just born of chemicals. They smell like what they are: rubber. So if you have ever had a new bike tire in your house, that is the smell, multiplied by a few pairs. It doesn\'t bother me in the slightest, and I was able to start using right away. I cannot relate at all to folks who seemed like they were going to swoon after opening the boxes.NOTE: I ""washed"" these with dish soap and water before using because they are covered in manufacturing residual dust etc. and will make your hands filthy otherwise. Mine did *not* have any kind of oily residues, as others have mentioned; again, just new tire smell, which for me is not obnoxious. But hey- some people think cilantro tastes terrible, so there is no accounting for taste.NOTE #2: Unlike the way Amazon\'s own brand and some other DBs I have purchased are wrapped, these were just loose in the box. No Styrofoam, no placement in a baggie, nada. Just in the box. So they are not going to be 100% brand new and flawless looking when you take them out. Get over it. They\'re dumbbells. They\'ll look like that in a couple months of workouts anyway. Also, because there is no protection, be judicious in opening the boxes. Just slice around the tape so you are not gouging a chunk out of your new best friends.I got these for basically a buck a pound, which is what weights were before Covid, and what they should be anyway, and held off on buying them until I hit the sale amount. Having said that, they would still be worth it for the $200 amount too, of course, just slightly less of a bargain.As has been mentioned by other reviewers, the A-frame is easy to put together, but will take your fingers off if you are not watching what you are doing when replacing the weights onto the rack, something which was also true at many gyms I have used and is a bug and not a feature of this style of rack.Definitely recommend, and would purchase again. Plan on augmenting with additional weights and eventually using a horizontal rack for all of them, but this was a steal-- and delivered on top of it.I am keeping the boxes. These are some of the heaviest duty boxes I have had sent to me.

There were many dumbbell brands to choose from, but I'm thrilled I chose this Lionscool brand. The dumbbells/hand weights arrived quickly, carefully bubble-wrapped and zip-tied together so they didn't damage each other (neoprene coating), nor bounce around in transit, plus packaging was strong to support weight of dumbbells. These hand weights come in great colors with weight numbers on the end. I don't feel the neoprene will degrade through use or age. The weights work well and I love the light purple color. I also purchased the 2 lb. weights, and they were packaged identically. The two sets DID arrived separately, which was actually nice if you are limited on how much you can pick up due to my shoulder surgery (I had them shipped to an Amazon locker). It will be some time before I move up to the 2lb weights, but I'm glad I purchased both sets. I would definitely purchase this brand again. I especially like that they are not slick. The neoprene coating covering all of the dumbbell(s) feel a little sandy/gritty, but does not hurt your hand, nor will they slip from your hand accidentally, and six-sided ends. They seem priced similarly to other brands, but since I plan to have these a long time, I figured, why not get the colors-themed sets that I like best, with non-slip weights. (I have 2 and 3 lb. single dumbbells that I purchased at a store which were on sale years ago that are slick, glossy, vinyl-type material colored with end numbers fading off the weights).

If the bar doesn\'t rotate, pick it up and flip it, and then put it in place, then it will rotate with ease all the way through.Like one of video clip reviews said, you might want to get some tape and color code if you purchase two dumbbells. Use the colored tape so you know which way to place dumbbells in the tray every time.Now the plates came in the correct directions on the tray and I was able to rotate the bar easily, but obviously at some point, I picked up one the plates and placed it incorrectly.So, once you take your dumbbells out of the box, all you really have to do is get some tape and place it in a way that you will remember to put the bar in same place everytime, and color them like one of other video reviews said.A little tiddeous thing to do, but for the price it\'s not too badREMEMBER, If all the plates are not faced in the same direction as stated above, your dumbbells will lock up on you, and you will not be able rotate pass the second level.

The weights are in 11 pound increments but I've found you can work in 5.5 pound increments by removing one of the weights on the stand so that it doesn't engage the handle (see image).Speaking of the handle, it appears to be very hard plastic or graphite and the grip area is covered by a rubberized material making it comfortable to hold.

It's probably mostly plastic with a layer over it to make it nicer to hold. The weight grips don't roll or pinch my skin when in use and the weights are easy to take off a put on once you practice a couple of times. I think as long as you don't drop them, store them in a hot/humid place, gently clean them after each use, and take your time to remove/attach the weights, these dumbells should last a long time. There is a specific way to line up the attachments. If you look carefully at each, you'll see the button has a raised bump that fits perfectly into a slot on the weight. If you don't line it up there, the weight can fall off. It's very similar to the way an Instapot lid works.

The box seemed to be taped together to denote a pair but the tape was only on one box so it was probably separated on purpose and address labels were on both boxes.Opening the boxes reveals the selector rods on top of a styrofoam covering the dumbbells and it is cradled on a form fitted styrofoam bottom for travel but I would not be surprised if there are accidents when shipping.I had the bowflex 552 for 12 years and wanted to expand the weight of the dumbbells so I picked up the power blocksI don‚Äôt have a gym membership and I‚Äôve been working out at home for 20 years. So I‚Äôm not too familiar with the single weight dumbbells. But weight is weight their prob more compact and it more stable than adjustable dumbbells.When I first received I didn‚Äôt like the rubber grip because it felt greasy. It was slipping from my grip so I cleaned it with a Clorox wipe and it has improved drastically.I don‚Äôt know why people hate the cage of the hand that much. I like the cage handle. I actually turn the weight so when I pick it up the padded cage ‚Äúbars‚Äù leans on my wrist so I use that to stabilize the weight as I perform my dumbbell bench pressing. This is an advantage I feel.The annoying thing is the two 2.5 adder weights to add or subtract for smaller incremental increases or decreases. On this powerblock the adder weight chamber gets locked as you return the handle to the weights. You won‚Äôt be able to operate the blocks without closing them.Also need to be mindful of the rod selector as you are choosing your weight make sure its level and is capturing the weight you want. It can easily go in lopsidedAnother thing I found was that when you‚Äôre doing bicep curls the red tab can get snagged on your pants/shorts as you‚Äôre curling up. I have rectified it by turning the block 180 degrees so those tabs are on the outside so it won‚Äôt snag.Also do not drop these weights it might get twisted and a bit mangledAlthough there is no cradle you still have to return the weights gently into the weight stack.The weights feel great in the hand and it smaller when your using less weight as opposed to the bowflex 552 which has the same length through out.OverallI recommend these weghts for your gym', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 31, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Expensive, but SO worth it!', 'author': 'SC', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I waited for years to buy these.

I've done a lot of research on adjustable weights lately and they typically range from double to quadruple the price of these for big name brands. These are very cost effective while also maintaining phenomenal quality. Unlike other adjustable weights these change from 11lbs to 55lbs in increments of 11 in seconds! Not only that but each weight is securely held. I don't have to worry about the weights falling on my head like others that have snap individual adjustments. They come with a rack that holds them in place and have a flat bottom on the weights so you don't have to worry about them rolling away either. You can also use them for assisted push ups and the handles have nice soft grip so you don't have to worry about them cutting up your hands or needing to wear gloves. The only real con is that the adjustable increments are 11lbs. However, I found you can simply remove one plate from the rack if you prefer an odd increment of say 16.5lbs instead of 11lbs or 22lbs as each plate weighs 5.5lbs. Multiply by 8 plus 11lbs handle gives you 55lbs.

After reading other reviews about each of the varying weights, I conducted a very unscientific test of weighing myself while holding each weight. In my set, the 3 lb and 8 lb weights each weighed exactly 3 lbs and 8 lbs. The 5 lb weights, however, each weighed 5.4 lbs. Certainly not a major discrepancy and nothing that warrants any complaints from me. They are comfortably solid and fully covered in color-coordinated neoprene coating with no discernible defects. Each weight was individually packaged in bubble wrap, and each set of weights was packaged snugly in their own box.The other complaint I saw in many of the reviews had to do with the plastic stand. Yes, it's true that the stand is plastic and not of the absolute highest quality. All hardware (including a cheap screwdriver) is included. I attempted to assemble the stand as is, but I can understand all the frustration involved with somewhat crooked screw holes and an unstable finished product. My solution was to first glue the plastic dowels to each half of the stand using Gorilla Glue and let it cure for 24 hours and THEN reinforce it with the included screws. I used 2 pieces of cardboard that came in the package and placed one on the bottom and one on the top because I knew some of the glue would leak through the screw holes. Essentially, the stand was lying flat on its side, sandwiched between the pieces of cardboard. I placed several of the weights on top to act as a clamp and keep pressure on the whole thing while the glue cured overnight. After I pulled the cardboard off, I used a pick to remove any excess glue from the screw holes. I tried using the included screwdriver but I quickly gave up on that and used a ratcheting screwdriver instead for more torque and was able to tightly fasten all 6 of the included screws. The assembled stand is now sturdy and stable with no fear of falling apart or toppling over on its own. I tested the movement of the stand while all the weights were on it and it wobbles slightly when you push on it (I mean, it IS plastic after all) but it's definitely sturdy and you'd have to push with some force to actually cause it to topple over. There should be no reason for this stand to be knocked over under normal use WITH ALL THE WEIGHTS in place. If you remove both of the 8 lb weights from the bottom, then yes, the stand could topple when pushed since it's top heavy. That goes for most top heavy items though. However, the stand is certainly stable while removing the weights and replacing them back on the stand.I suppose if you place the stand in the center of the room and are using both of the 8 lb weights at the same time, then it's conceivable that your child/dog/clumsy roommate or whatever could accidentally bump into it and knock it over. But really though? Who's placing their weights somewhere where people or animals are knocking into it? Just use common sense and place it near or against a wall or furniture and not in the path of others. I have mine against a wall and there's really no chance for it to fall over with normal use. Also, there's not an actual carry handle to transport the stand with the weights on it, but the notches at the bottom create handholds and you can CAREFULLY lift the stand straight up and move the entire set as necessary.I do agree that I should not have HAD to take the steps I took to ensure that my stand would be solid and sturdy. We should be able to assemble the stand directly out of the box without having to resort to using glue or struggle with wonky screw holes. But, it is what it is and I was able to use my available resources to make sure the stand was not going to fall apart. Personally, I purchased the set of weights specifically for the actual weights, not for the stand itself. As far as the weights are concerned, they're a great basic set of weights. If I could, I'd probably knock a half-star off for the issue with the stand, but otherwise it's a 5-star deal."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States November 6, 2018', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Great set but...The stand is junk!', 'author': 'kmillette1019', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'This is a great set of weights.

It doesn't topple over; it's just slanted now. I still use the dumbbells though, so I still recommend this product if you want entry-level, affordable dumbbells!Original Review:When my adjustable dumbbells broke (these: Bowflex SelectTech 552 Adjustable Dumbbells (Pair) ), I decided to buy this set from BalanceFrom. My Bowflex dumbbells were excellent quality, but they weren't ideal for the type of workouts I was doing. These BalanceFrom dumbbells are much better suited to my workouts. I definitely like these and recommend them. As for the stand, it's functional although flimsy.Pros:+ They're not as long/wide as my previous dumbbells, which makes them easier to move around during basic dumbbell workouts+ I weighed them and they're accurate to their weight (my scale isn't the best, but it's close enough that it should be negligible even if there's a slight difference)+ The colors are inviting (and they personally make me want to hold them)+ As expected, the neoprene coating and contoured handles allows you to have a good grip on it+ Extra parts for the stand are included just in case+ It comes with its own stand, which may be slightly wobbly, but serves its purpose (it also comes with a screwdriver!)Cons:- The stand is made of plastic, so it's wobbly after assembly- You have to carefully remove the dumbbells from it because of the wobbly standThe stand is functional. If you have someone else hold the stand upright as you TIGHTLY screw the sides of the stand together (not one by one, but a little bit on each side at a time), it should stand just fine on any surface. The stand is plastic and wobbles as I remove dumbbells from it, but it doesn't wobble much and hasn't completely collapsed or anything. I will update this review if it ever does. Basically, if you're the careful type, I feel the stand is fine. Even if you don't like the stand, you can just choose not to use it, since the price is great solely for the dumbbells.For the price, I feel the stand's quality is forgivable.

The weights themselves have a nice tactile feel both ergonomically and because of the grippy, rubberized material with which they are coated. The weights are brightly colored and aesthetically pleasing.The only drawback I noted was with the weight stand itself. I would recommend this product if you have a dedicated location where the weights will stay. While the weightstand is sufficient to hold the weight in place, i would not attempt to move the weights while on the stand. First, because there's no handle and second because the stand it seems too flimsy to try to carry while on the stand. If you really need your weights to be more portable, I wold reccommend investing in a better stand.

So much so that the delayed ship date kind of bummed me out, but turns out I didn't need to worry! The weights shipped the same day I ordered them and they arrived two business days later just like any other Prime item. I got to use these weights for the first time today and I am happy with them. My husband is pretty experienced with weights and he also said they were a nice set. The neoprene felt good to use while my hands were getting sweaty - I could maintain a good grip the whole time. These are my first weights, so as I have nothing to compare them to, here's a quick description. The blue and teal weights are actually a darker color than they appear in the photo. The grips and lengths on all the weights do vary depending on the weight - the 3 lb grip is thinner than the 5 and 8 lb grips, and the 3 lb weight is shorter than the 5 and 8 lb weights. The grip swells just a bit in the center. I have small hands - I prefer the grip on the smaller weights but even with the wider 8 lb grip, I'm able to get a good enough grip on it. The weights have a seam on them which I noticed a little during the workout but turning the weight a little made it unnoticeable. And again, I don't have anything to compare it to, so if you do, hopefully the description helps. I will be able to use them for all conceivable workouts, which is the point. I feel like these weights are a really good spread of resistance. I'm a girl, just beginning to do weight resistance so the 3 lb is great for a light weight and the 8 lb is great to challenge me.As for the rack, it was easy to put together by hand and it was really nice that I didn't have to go find a power drill or even a screwdriver to put it together, because it comes with everything you need. I was hoping I'd be able to move the weights around on the stand, but it's a little difficult to do just because there's so much weight on the stand. Which may be my fault for not being able to carry 32 lbs. Last thing, the stand is actually a bit narrow - when the dog came over to inspect the weights, the stand tipped over. I haven't found any dumbbell sets that come with a sturdy stand though, so I'd make a purchase just based on the weights.I was just very excited to find a 32 lb set for such a good price.

Essentially, I gather my information and determine what is and what isn\'t important. Same deal with these weights . . . So, this is what I determined about what was really important to me: 1. All parts were sturdy and well made/constructed; 2. Similar to number 1, that the weights had zero to minimum movement while working out; 3. The weight set was ""compact"" even when using maximum load of 50lbs; and, 4. The company supported their product with excellent customer service (note: I do not know this personally, but from what I have read, they do a good job of this).All of the aforementioned were answered positively by what I read and reviewed. So, what was my first impression? The delivery was on time and the packaging was excellent. Two boxes were delivered to my door, and I had zero issues with the boxes/packaging. Assembly was simple. Fast forward to working out everyday (upper body one day and lower body the next) the last few weeks and I am extremely impressed with my weight set. Why? First and foremost, I discovered for myself what others had already discovered - this is a quality weight set, with little to no movement of the weights while in motion; and the set is compact, where someone lean like myself can easily maneuver the weights while doing various exercises. For example, when you are doing overhead tricep extensions with one weight at maximum weight (50 lbs), it is very important that you have a good two handed grip while maneuvering into the overhead position. I was concerned before buying the weights that the adjustable mechanism would interfere or not be comfortable either during the process of getting into the position or actually doing the tricep extension exercise. NO WORRIES . . . IT IS QUITE COMFORTABLE - BOTH GETTING INTO THE POSITION AND DOING THE ACTUAL EXERCISE. Regarding the actual adjustment mechanism, it is well made and so simple to use. One turn of the wrist and you move the weight dial up or down. Simple.The only issue - a minor one - is removing the weights from the floor rack when you exceed approximately 25 or more lbs. This is simply rectified by using your foot on the side bar of the rack. Quite frankly, more times than not, it never happens if you remove the weights in a firm and deliberate manner.Conclusion? I am quite impressed with this adjustable weight set.

Since we don't have a lot of space, an adjustable set is what I decided on. The price on these seems competitive for adjustable dumbbells - not expensive, but not exactly cheap either. Here are my pros and cons so far.Pros:- Adjustable weights from 5 to 50 lbs (I didn't weigh them to make sure the advertised weight is accurate as that didn't matter to me).- Selection method. The way of selecting the desired weight works well. Spinning the handle to select the weight is easy and intuitive.- Compact storage. This is important if space is at a premium. We can store these in a small corner of the garage and bring them out when needed.- No bar extending past the weight. I had originally bought dumbbell handles that you can add weights to, but that meant the bar extended past the weight and could be in the way doing some exercises such as overhead ones. On these the weight gets added to the ends of the dumbbell so they act just like a full set of individual dumbbells and there is no bar extending past the weight.- Comfortable. They are not overly padded so you can get a secure grip and the contoured handle feels fine in my hands.Cons:- When selecting heavier weight, the dumbbell tends to get stuck in the carrier and you have to hold the carrier down with a free hand or foot. I fixed this by building a cart for the dumbbells that holds the carrier down. (Cart is also useful for moving them in and out of where they are stored)- Sometimes you can't select the heavier weight if the handle isn't fully inserted. Resetting the handle with a little more force works to fix that issue.- The weight rattles a little when lifting. That makes me unsure of how long the attachment method will hold up. It is working fine so far.Fine but odd:- These came as a set in 2 boxes. The first box we opened only included the weights and carrier. We figured out how to set the dumbbells up easily enough but I was expecting some instructions. The second box not only had the instructions, but logo endcaps for both dumbbells. It was clear that the 2 boxes we meant to be a set, but I wondered why both boxes weren't packed identically with the instructions and one set of the endcaps."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 4, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': ""5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent adjustable dumbell set, if you're looking for your first set this is the one."", 'author': 'gimpyviper', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I've been building out my home gym since my kids have picked up and rekindled my passion/hobby for weight lifting.

(I was in a bit of a hurry, like I said the Pro Forms are fine, but just wish they had 5 lbs increment instead.)Couple of things to note, I wish the handle was knurled steel but that's a personal preference and for me one area where the Pro Forms have an advantage, but this is a personal preference, not really functional though we'll see how the handles on these fare over time.Assembly was easy, the weight selection mechanism is actually kind of ingenious. It feels well made but the core is made of plastic, so it can only feel so well made but that's what helps to keep the cost down of these amazing dumbbells.One thing of note when you're using them you need to be mindful of positioning when returning the dumbbells to the carrier/remaining weight plates. Same for when you take them out, sometimes they'll get stuck. However this problem isn't unique to these dumbbells.Overall, 100% would recommend."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 16, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Quality adjustable dumbbells', 'author': 'Jim C.', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Love the adjustable dumbbells.

They also save money and space over storing a set of individual dumbbells at 5 pound increments. The only issue I have is that when you go above20 or 25 ponds the number of plates that have to be stacked on each end of the handle makes the dumbbell a bit wide. This makes things like chest presses a little less effective because the sides of the wights touch before you get the full range of motion. I think this would be a better product if they made the plates thinner. This may be tough in order to get the locking system to work properly. The display also makes the weights wider, so maybe a redesign there.Bottom line, I looked at a lot of products that were similar and if I had the space and $$$ for a full set of dumbbells, I might go that route, but these are an excellent compromise.

Best to put the rack and bench together with one other person and use a ratchet set to make the process pretty seemless. We put both packages together in about 1.5 hours. The weights are packaged with oil to help with stability in storage and will need a good wipe down. Also, the grips will be slick so make sure to also clean them well.

It's more than big enough for all my weights -- in fact, it could have been a little smaller (my workout room isn't too big) but I'm not complaining because it's a really solid rack that looks good. My only complaint is that the 16 nuts that came with the product, to secure the bolts in place, were a little too tight. Well, a lot too tight. I'm fairly good at putting together furniture and equipment, but except for 2 nuts which screwed on and tightened nicely, the rest were too tight to be tightened all the way. I ended up giving up on the provided nuts and found some the same size in my toolbox. These looked identical, but tightened down all the way perfectly. Not sure what was wrong -- I think they might have used the wrong plastic ring inside the nuts. This would have been a big problem had I not had a toolbox full of random parts, so hopefully they can fix this for other people who may not be so lucky.

It is all about reducing resistance to exercise, if there is a full rack of dumbells at work and I have a spare minute or two I can do a few sets really quick. I haven't bought it because COVID is making all exercise equipment hard to find.But I digress, what is not to like? The assembly is straightforward and was not difficult, took maybe 30 minutes. I don't use the little weights, so I just put them elsewhere, but then I freed up space to add additional heavier weights to it. So I go from 25 to 80 on my rack and so its heavier but still handles the load fine. Though the one I have on my second floor did worry me, but it hasn't collapsed through the first floor ceiling yet.The diameter of the grip on these is quite nice. The one odd weight I have is my 60# set, they're metal, not rubber coated, with a narrower grip. Despite the fact that buying rubber ones would be over $200 dollars with current COVID pricing I'm considering it because the grip is just so much nicer on these than on that one.There are no moving parts and nothing to break, they're dumbbells, they work. I will say that if you're considering this style of dumbbell rack versus the pyramid or triangle style. Get this style. Those pyramid styles use hooks that grip the grip of the dumbbell, this stand uses shelves that hold the weight of the dumbbell. So imagine you're reracking a heavy dumbbell onto a pair of hooks where the hooks have to go where your hand is. Unless you have very small hands the odds of a pinch are pretty good.

I purchased this just over two years ago and started exercising just a few minutes each day. I immediately saw progress in the weight/reps/sets I could do for each exercise, doing a little more each week. This motivated me to keep progressing. After a year, I purchased a higher-capacity adjustable dumbbell since I maxed out the weight on this one. A few months ago, I got a bench, a barbell, and a set of weights to go further. I now have spreadsheets to track my progress and workout schedule and I spend ~2 hours each week lifting. This product allowed me to get started and realize how rewarding exercising can be.

They're textured enough to provide a good grip, but not so much that they eat into your hands or require gloves.The weight bar is covered in plastic and there is no way to get metal splinters from the end of it (other weight sets had this complaint)Cons:The washer that secures the weights tends to come loose over time, and needs to be tightened occasionally. Annoying, but not a dealbreaker. It's not like it comes loose when you're using the weights, so as long as you check it once before lifting each session you'll be fine. People report a similar complaint with the Amazonbasics weight set, so it's not unique to this one.They seem fairly bulky for how heavy they are, but I'm not sure if metal would be more compact. Looking at the amazonbasics set, it seems like the weights are smaller, which is more convenient when doing certain exercises (weights don't bump against your thighs when doing shrugs). The size issue is my biggest complaint.Nitpicks:These are vinyl weights, so the weights are concrete with a plastic cover over them. According to other sites, the downside of vinyl is that you can potentially crack/damage the concrete core of the weights if you drop them on a hard surface enough times, whereas metal will last basically forever. I never slam the weights down, so this isn't really a concern for me.Visually, they look kind of cheap, and don't look have the high quality/indestructible look that metal has.Overall, they are solid and do the job, but I think I would've preferred to get the amazonbasics set, mostly due to the size issue."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 7, 2019', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars I love the weights they are nice', 'author': 'Zahria', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I love the way you can take off plates if you want less they are good quality !!', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 22, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '3.0 out of 5 stars Get what you pay for', 'author': 'Rebekah L.', 'rating': 3, 'content': 'Purchased these as they were a much better price than any others I could find.

I didn\'t have a problem with them, even though they delivered my dumbbells 2 days after the delivery estimate(can\'t complain, free shipping). Fedex Smartpost sends to the closest USPS, then USPS takes an additional 2 days to deliver. It seems like most people hate Fedex Smartpost because they take longer than usual(""google fedex smartpost sucks"" to see what I\'m talking about). I ordered these on 2-9-13 and they arrived at my doorstep on 2-16-13, so one week exactly, average time for free shipping. The dumbbells came packaged professionally and my case came in perfect condition, which I was very pleased about.I also ordered 60 pound db set from Lion Roar Fitness on 2-8-13, and as of 2-16, they didn\'t even start shipping so I ended up cancelling that order. They charged $20 for shipping too... I will NEVER even consider buying from LRF again. Just wanted to warn you guys about that. $20 for shipping AND they lag it? No thank you.These Dumbbell sets are a great investment, and I know they will last a long time. First of all, there is no toxic chemical smell the negative reviewers mentioned. Not even the case it came with. They clearly have gotten better with quality control. I read ALL of the negative reviews and took a chance with these, and I am glad I did. My bars are all nicely polished, smooth, and the weights and collars fit accordingly. There are 4 pieces of rubber stoppers that help keep these weights in place, 2 in the middle of the bar and 2 that are connected to the collars, which does an excellent job. When you lift weights, you should never ""jerk"" through your workouts, but instead keep good form with nice controlled movements. That\'s how my workouts are, and the weights have not moved, rolled, clanked, at all. The only time the collars roll out, is when I twist them to change weights. I even put all the plates on one bar(30 lbs) and the weights/collars were still in place. People say these are not the best quality, but what more do you expect from a set of dumbbells? Good finish on the plates with a clean tough metal bar, which cannot rip as some rubber grip bars tend to rip after tightening the collars too much. Carefully put the plates on, or you could scratch/chip off the paint. If you don\'t like getting callouses on your hands, I recommend investing in gloves. I don\'t feel a thing with gloves on and can enjoy lifting weights without getting blisters. If you have Fat Gripz(check my review for Fat Gripz), you don\'t even need gloves. Those rubber suckers will cover it, and give you a much better workout.I will buy additional plates for these soon but before you guys do as well, try adding Fat Gripz to the bars with your normal workouts. It will give your workouts more of a challenge, and you will see some good results in your forearm strength. I wish I knew about them when I wrestled in high school..Long story short, don\'t listen to the negative reviews. Keep yourself in shape and buy these already!Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that the bars + collars does not equal 5 pounds(unless you are weighing both bars and 4 collars together). So you get about 17.5 pounds each dumbbell. The description states that they weigh 5 pounds but it\'s half. The case it comes with is about 5 or 6 pounds so that\'s where they kind of trick you. So if you do the math, 4 x 5lbs plate + 4 x 2.5 lbs plate + 2 x 2.5 collars & bar = 35 lbs + 5 lbs case = 40 lbs db set.. I\'m not going to knock off a star for that because I bought these knowing this information. We can always buy more plates, so no big deal.Thank you for reading my long review. I hope this helped make your decision in building a better body!

It's not perfect, but I'm not really sure that the imperfections matter for a product like this. So let's get the negatives out of the way first:- Yeah, they smell, as others have noted. It's nothing strange -- if you've ever been to a gym before, you already know this smell. They're metallic with additional chemical odors. For a basic sniff test, you won't notice much. But the smell does begin to accumulate after a few days in cramped quarters, so maybe they're not the best choice for a bedroom or tiny apartment. I suspect the smell will dissipate in time, but I don't know how long that will be.- The carrying case is cheap molded plastic, and there's a good chance yours will arrive with one or more corners dented. It's fine -- the cases aren't meant to be display items. They're meant to store the weights, and to give you a convenient way to lug them around when needed.- It's obvious that corners were cut in some regards. The rubber cushions on the bars are cheap, and could possibly fall off and get lost if you aren't attentive. Likewise, the rubber cushions within the screw-on collars can fall out. It's not a big deal if they do -- you just stick them back in. But these are obviously not advanced equipment. They were designed to be cheap and functional.That said, I don't think any of these cons really matter. Weights have one purpose in life -- to weigh something. Your muscles can't tell if you're holding twenty pounds of expensive metal or cheap metal. This particular set is very well priced, and they feel safe and sturdy. You don't have to worry about the collars wiggling loose, and they're adjustable down to 2.5 pound increments. I snagged two sets, giving me greater versatility and the ability to put more weight on a single bar if needed. For the price, this is a perfect way to get started with a cheap, space-saving home gym.Weights don't need to be pretty and fancy to work. They just need to give gravity something to act on. You can buy fancier equipment than this, but it's not clear why you'd really want to."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 3, 2014', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Honest review addressing common concerns...', 'author': 'Bleacherbum95', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'When originally considering this product I was very concerned with the number of negative reviews/comments that people were leaving about these dumbbells. After deciding to take the risk, I felt the need to write a review since I believe that the negative reviews are overblown and overly dramatic. I will hopefully address the main concerns that you as the prospective buyer are having while considering this product. If you don\'t care about the details I have a TLDR at the bottom =)1. Smell: These weights do not smells like daisies; no dumbbells do. However, the smell is NOT as bad as people are saying. I would highly recommend leaving these weights outside (and/or washing them) to let them air out and control the smell, but it is not immediately overpowering. When the package arrived I slowly opened the box waiting for a toxic stench to explode out, but it never came. It was not until I lifted a plate out of the box that I noticed the smell people mentioned (the chemical applied to prevent rust), and it was not very strong. I left mine in the garage to air out and noticed a slight change in the smell of the garage, but nothing extreme. I would certainly keep them out of the house to be safe, but for $40 a quick wash or airing out was worth it to me.2: Quality: If you are looking for professional dumbbells that are made of top quality materials then look elsewhere. But if you are looking for a solid set of starter weights, this is your product. I will say that the first time I removed a collar a small piece of metal broke off, but it did not affect the functionality of the piece. Also, I noticed someone mentioned that the collar lets the weights slide...this was incorrect in my experience. The collars seem to hold the weights snugly in place, so there should be no problems there. The quality is by no means great (unbeatable for the price though), but it is good enough that I trust it will last and serve its purpose.3. Case: I saw a few people talking about how the case broke easily. The case seems fairly sturdy if it is treated well. A case breaking or not will depend on your delivery man. The weights are packaged very well inside a few boxes (Amazon ships it out in an excessively large box), and in my experience there were no cracks. The sliders to keep the box closed seem pretty lame, but I\'m one of those people who isn\'t going to sweat it if the case breaks.I hope I covered the main concerns that most people were having. My honest review of this product is that this is unbeatable for the price. $40 with free shipping (mine came in 2 days) is great, and these are exactly what I was looking for. And NO I was not paid for this review and think Amazon should be ashamed of including paid reviews.TLDR: Does NOT smell that bad (easily fixed), decent quality, best bang for the buck for somebody looking for starter dumbbells.UPDATE 1/25/14: I now have two sets of these (it was cheaper than buying weight individually), and they are holding up great after over a year and a half of use. I\'ve noticed the collar shifts slightly when you get over 30lbs, but never enough that it\'s a problem. Be confident in purchasing these as starter weights.UPDATE 7/31/16: My original bars are still going strong. The collar shifting still happens on occasion, but not to the point where it interferes with my workout. I\'ve purchased additional plates for it and added them just fine - any 1"" plate should fit just as well as the originals. So these have held up strong for 4 years...zero complaints here. One thing I forgot in the original review - you may want some lifting gloves. The metals isn\'t forgiving on your hands, so if you don\'t want big calluses, invest in a cheap pair of gloves.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States June 2, 2012', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great Adjustible Weight Set', 'author': 'Lumbre', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'First of all, let\'s get the smell part clear. Yes, it smells. It smells similar to the stuff you find in the tire/automotive aisles at Target/WalMart/other stores. Yes, it can be a bit strong. Let it air for a day and put a dryer sheet in the case when you close it. Problem solved. If you\'re picky on having your home smell like candles or something, these are not for you. If you don\'t even notice the smell of a gym when you\'re in a gym (or aren\'t the quickest to pick up on smells), then you\'re fine. Also, I think it\'s the box that smells, not any of the paint.Pros:*It is easy to add/remove weights. Just unscrew the collars, remove/add weights, screw collars back in. You can do this while resting in less than a minute.*You can add your own weights. When you outgrow these, you can add your own weights (doesn\'t have to be the same brand). Any generic 1"" weight will do.*When I bought these, they were awesome for $40. Under $1/pound if you count the different combinations of weights you can do and that you can add more later.*Cheap compared to buying individually.Cons:*Slight bump in one of the corners of the case. No big deal. Contents inside are fine. Just an aesthetic issue.*Smell. As addressed above, it can be a bit overpowering, but just take the time to let them air out. Some people also do fine by rinsing them.*They\'re not neoprene.Notes & Thoughts:*A lot of people complain about the default California warning added to this set. Seriously, California is overprotective. Drinking dozens of gallons of water is known to cause death. If ingested, gasoline can destroy your organs. Too much sun can give you cancer. They have these warnings on a ton of things for sale in California. Something containing nickel, for example, automatically gets this warning. If it were more serious, more states or the entire country would place a warning or they would be getting sued for giving people cancer (it\'s not like lawyers are exactly shy).*The handles may be a bit too textured for some people, especially those with delicate hands or buying more weights. In that case, maybe you should buy weight-lifting gloves. For those who don\'t mind getting scuffed by sand or falling hands-first on pavement, you\'re fine. If anything, I shift my hands around on the bar which varies up my routine a bit.*People say it\'s a good starter set. I just started a serious workout routine and have had this for a month. I see myself having this for years.*A few have complained that the weights aren\'t exact. The bar doesn\'t seem like 5 pounds, but when I weight myself with one of my 20 lb. dumbbells, I see my weight increase by 19.8 or 20 (my scale goes in intervals of 0.2). It\'s close enough for me. I don\'t need it to be that exact.*Mine didn\'t seem to have any loose seal rings or collars. They seem good for the price. They may shift a small amount after a 30 minute workout to where you can hear a slight clunk.

While most iron free-weights sell for around $2/pound (as of the fall of 2022), this set is much more affordable,The price for it does seem to vary wildly day by day. I paid $77 in October 2022 and see that a month later, it is selling for $65. But I‚Äôm not complaining since it‚Äôs a steal at either price.I bought 2 sets so I‚Äôd have a pair of dumbbells.The dumbbell bars and threaded, star-shaped end nuts are nicely made. The chrome coating seems thick and durable. And because the threaded nuts have black rubber washers on the side that makes contact with the weight plates, they tighten securely and stay firmly in place when in use. Other sets I‚Äôve used did not have the rubber washer and as a result, would loosen up while doing reps. That‚Äôs both annoying and dangerousThe rubber washers do tend to fall off when removing the nuts from the dumbbell, but that is easily rectified by putting a few drops of superglue in the groove in the nut into which the rubber washer sits.The weight plates themselves are a little less precisely made. For instance, I weighed my 5 lb plates on a postal scale and discovered they range anywhere from 4.75 lbs to 5.25 lbs. That‚Äôs not a big deal most of the time but you can definitely notice an imbalance if you inadvertently end up with 8 of the heavier 5 lb plates on one hand and 8 of the lighter plates on the other.To avoid that from happening, I used a silver Sharpie to mark the plate that are over 5 lbs and keep them in a separate pile so I can distribute the weight more evenly into the bars.Also, while the clear-coat on the plates seems heavy duty enough, you do need to check for rough edges. That goes for the dumbbell bars too. I had to file down a couple of spots to avoid getting metal splinters in my hands.Last but not least, the dumbbells I received have a diameter of 1.18 inches (or 30mm) and the weight plates have holes that size. This means any plates you may already have with 1 inch (25mm) holes will not fit onto these bars. Likewise, while the plates from this set will easily go onto a 1 inch bar, they can flop around a bit. In practice the latter is not a problem as long as you can tighten down the bar-end clamps. I use my 30mm plates on a 25mm curl bar without issue.In short, while there may be some compromises involved, at these prices, this dumbbell set is one of the best deals out there.Follow up note written on April 11, 2023:I‚Äôve been using my weight set several times a week for about 6 months now and all parts are holding up great!', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States November 28, 2022', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Really like these', 'author': 'Amazon Customer', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I needed a set to get started with.

In my case, while extremely heavy duty boxes were used, and well taped, one of the boxes was sliced open and minor damage to rubber ends of DBs in that box occurred. Looks like it was slid over something which cut it through.In any event, 2x5, 2x10, 2x15, 2x20, 2x25# DBs are included, making this an excellent ""base"" set. Handles are knurled and as expected in diameter and abrasiveness. No gloves required, but your mileage may vary.Is there a smell? seems to be the burning question. Of course they have a smell. They were just born of chemicals. They smell like what they are: rubber. So if you have ever had a new bike tire in your house, that is the smell, multiplied by a few pairs. It doesn\'t bother me in the slightest, and I was able to start using right away. I cannot relate at all to folks who seemed like they were going to swoon after opening the boxes.NOTE: I ""washed"" these with dish soap and water before using because they are covered in manufacturing residual dust etc. and will make your hands filthy otherwise. Mine did *not* have any kind of oily residues, as others have mentioned; again, just new tire smell, which for me is not obnoxious. But hey- some people think cilantro tastes terrible, so there is no accounting for taste.NOTE #2: Unlike the way Amazon\'s own brand and some other DBs I have purchased are wrapped, these were just loose in the box. No Styrofoam, no placement in a baggie, nada. Just in the box. So they are not going to be 100% brand new and flawless looking when you take them out. Get over it. They\'re dumbbells. They\'ll look like that in a couple months of workouts anyway. Also, because there is no protection, be judicious in opening the boxes. Just slice around the tape so you are not gouging a chunk out of your new best friends.I got these for basically a buck a pound, which is what weights were before Covid, and what they should be anyway, and held off on buying them until I hit the sale amount. Having said that, they would still be worth it for the $200 amount too, of course, just slightly less of a bargain.As has been mentioned by other reviewers, the A-frame is easy to put together, but will take your fingers off if you are not watching what you are doing when replacing the weights onto the rack, something which was also true at many gyms I have used and is a bug and not a feature of this style of rack.Definitely recommend, and would purchase again. Plan on augmenting with additional weights and eventually using a horizontal rack for all of them, but this was a steal-- and delivered on top of it.I am keeping the boxes.

This was absolutely our favorite option and, in our opinion, the best choice based on both price, quality, and the apparent quality of the build materials (aka durability, long-lasting-ness).Basically, this is everything we wanted and at a completely fair price. The range of weight options they provide is great and higher than many other listings. Also, it was the perfect balance of aesthetic appeal and seeming sturdiness (although sturdiness was obviously the higher priority).The hexagonal shapes make it so they don't roll when on the ground. The fact that it can be either dumbbells or a bar is amazing. And the heavy, deep grooves are the main thing to help assure you that it won't fall off and is safe to use.The only weird thing I could say to give anyone a heads-up is that there are tiny 'grub' screws (I think they're called??) that you have to tighten with an Allen key (provided with set, of course) and some might find that uncomfortable or strange. Because you have to use the little 'L-shaped' tool every time to re-tighten the little tiny screw into the big twisty-tightening ring thing. However, this is completely normal, not their fault or bad design, it's simply the trade-off that YOU must pay for because you want something that can do all kinds of wacky stuff all at once, interchangeably. I've actually seen other little screw things that you can do with your hands, but the allen key set thing is not enough to deduct a star. I suppose I could buy those hand-tighten-able things myself elsewhere if I really wanted to.All in all, pretty amazing. Feel like we've made a solid investment for years to come.

Barbell mode is wonderful and simple and having a flat bottom makes for easy storage.Now for the bad. This wasn't manufactured very well fit several reasons. The threads for the barbells to enter into the dumbbell are not deep enough so in the light dumbbell mode you will have exposed threads. The threads are also not made very tight, even with the locking pin in place the weights will rotate. The foam cover doesn't move and it hasn't been placed in the middle so getting a perfect center on that alone is hard.

But then you have the pain of dealing with Craigslist and going and picking them up. Dumbbells from most other sources are 2 or even 3 times more expensive, which compounds significantly if you need a full set.Cons:1. Chip easily.

For me I don‚Äôt need something pretty - picking up an ugly piece of metal has the same effect as picking up a pretty piece of metal, but for half the price.If you buy the ‚Äúused‚Äù ones when they pop up, you can get them for almost $1/lb.

These were shipped and sold by Amazon.This was not even remotely worth the small savings over the rubber headed dumbbells I have bought many times through amazon.To begin, they ship these in a cardboard box and that is pretty much it. Only one dumbbell arrived on time. The box was absolutely shredded from trying to contain 65 lbs of iron. In fact, the dumbbell was falling out of the box when it arrived. The UPS man also just dumped this at the top of the driveway. This dumbbell has also defective. One of the welds was poorly done and visibly defective. I could feel the dumbbell head wobbling when pressed over head. That's scary for a 65 lbs dumbbell. The handle itself also was poorly finished.The second dumbbell arrived a week late. Its box was also destroyed and you could tell UPS had to add extra packing tape just to hold the box together. This was also dumped in the grass at the top of my driveway. It was even worse than the first dumbbell. The dumbbell head was extremely loose from the handle. I don't know if this is a defect or damaged in shipping. I guess it is probably both.I also received a replacement from Amazon for dumbbell #1. This time it didn't even arrive with a a box. There was literally just a shipping label zip tied to the dumbbell. The sad little cardboard box they ship these big dumbbells in must have been obliterated in transit. The dumbbell looks like it was dragged across concrete. Paint was chipped and peeling off. One corner looked ground down. The welds actually looked good on this one but there was too much physical damage from shipping.I am returning them all.Maybe these cast iron dumbbells would be a good option for lighter weights or if Amazon even remotely cared about packaging. I would never again consider trying to buy the heavier weights of these cast iron dumbbells. I didn't even get one functional/undamaged dumbbell from the three they sent.

Adjustable weights at around $2.20 a pound is a steal! I've done a lot of research on adjustable weights lately and they typically range from double to quadruple the price of these for big name brands. These are very cost effective while also maintaining phenomenal quality. Unlike other adjustable weights these change from 5lbs to 25lbs in increments of 11 in seconds! Not only that but each weight is securely held. I don't have to worry about the weights falling on my head like others that have snap individual adjustments. They come with a rack that holds them in place and have a flat bottom on the weights so you don't have to worry about them rolling away either. You can also use them for assisted push ups and the handles have nice soft grip so you don't have to worry about them cutting up your hands or needing to wear gloves. . However, I found you can simply remove one plate from the rack if you prefer an odd increment of say 16.5lbs instead of 11lbs or 22lbs as each plate weighs 5.5lbs. Multiply by 8 plus 11lbs handle gives you 55lbs. Lastly I love how the plates are tough steel and not those bulky plastic plated plates you see on some name brand adjustable dumbbells that look and feel cheap. 5* I'd recommend it to everyone from beginners to pros."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 22, 2022', 'is_verified': True}]"

The actual system that we use was out of stock and way delayed. This is a good substitute with some limitations for workouts at home, at a fraction of the cost of the actual LM set.I really appreciate that the plates are solid material with a TPU outer ring. Most of these other sets are sand-filled plastic shells and that's a no-go for me. They're very sturdy and durable - reinforced in places that need them and the numbers stand out. The threading of the bars is also very thick, smooth, and easy to do-up or break apart. There is a slight bit of play when the barbell is put together with the connecting rod but this is a tradeoff for easier assembly/ disassembly, and while it may loosen up a little bit, there is enough threading to keep it from coming apart. The bar is about 1.1-1.5 inches in diameter depending on where you grab it so it's got a good heft and feel to it.The Specs:Dumbell bars > 2lbs (I think 2.2lbs.)Bar connector < 2lbs (about 1.8 lbs.) - finished bar ~ 7lbs. (these weights are from when I first weighed them)4x. 2 Kg (4.4 lbs)4x 1.25 Kg (2.75 lbs)4x 1 Kg (2.2 lbs)4 + 1 plastic screw locking nut. (I appreciate the extra one)I generally use my bar for squats like the first set-up. This is about 36.8 lbs and I think this isn't recommended because the locking screws can't be done in all the way (The correct way is probably in the second photo). I don't recommend the connected dumbbells for added weight during squats as it doesn't rest on the meaty part of the upper back.Limitation: It maxes out the available weight for this bar with what you have, but the end connectors still screw them together securely. For Bodypump, it's a little on the light side, and because the end stops are threaded, it just takes a bit longer to change weight - but you're buying this system and it's really only light for squats at my level.This bar is great for the repeated rows, deadlifts, high-pulls, clean and press, chest press, shoulder press, bicep curls... Endless possibilitiesLimitation: If you have a bigger wingspan, the barbell is a bit narrow (28 in./ 71 cm. across plate-to-plate) to do wide rows and presses.For BP, the plates also feel good in the hand if you want to hold them together for presses during the lunge track or those days where your shoulders/lats are gone during the flyes and rotators in the shoulder track. I like how they're not entirely round, they have flat sections.You can also break them apart as dumbells for unilateral work, as I do when I'm not doing BP. This is an alternative to the wide rows/presses with the barbell if you want to put more isolation on the left/right sides of your body.*I think in this case, you cannot exceed 3 plates on either side of the dumbbell bar in the case of making one super heavy dumbbell.*Other constructive criticisms:- If the connector can be slightly longer, adding maybe 10 - 12 inches to the span of the barbell- The weight set is a little light and I'd like some expandability. Maybe sell additional heavier weight plates on the side for us to upgrade our existing sets.Again, I am very happy with this bar set-up. It achieves everything that it can do within its specifications for a reasonable price point, and I'm honestly considering another set as a gift."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 4, 2020', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect for at home use', 'author': 'Blaire', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Ive been working out at home for a while and this is perfect for easy at home use.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 29, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars slightly heavy enough.', 'author': 'klaudie rice jr', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'great starter set to tone small build.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 7, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great value', 'author': 'Chris Montgomery', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""This set has been absolutely amazing.

They‚Äôre very sturdy and have a similar hand feel to a barbell you‚Äôd find at a gym. The plates are stiff steel coated in rubber. The plastic coating on the dumbbell handles was different but after a few workouts I got used to it. Everything arrived perfectly intact and was even a day earlier than expected!I agree with other reviews that screwing the caps on and off can get a bit tedious and does slightly break up the flow of the workout.

Gotts', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'The NordicTrack adjustable dumbbells are a real winner that are working out well for my wife and I.Pros:1) Nice weight range (10-55) and sufficient increments for me. We have a small set of 2.5 to 8-lb individual dumbbells to fill in on the very low end.2) Compact dumbbells. The dumbbells are no longer than needed for the weight you are using. The 10-lb configuration is narrower than the 20-lb, which is narrower than the 30-lb, which is narrower than the 40-lb, which is narrower than the 50-lb. DO NOT DISCOUNT this when shopping for adjustable dumbbells. You do not want to be swinging around a 2-ft long bar in each hand when simply using a 10-lb dumbbell. It gets in the way and limits the range of motion for some exercises. These incrementally add plates to the end as the weight goes up. So they are compact at low weights, and very much the size of a fixed dumbbell of similar weight at heavier weights.3) Easy to adjust. The adjustment system is low effort, but locks solidly and seems unlikely to fail long term, normal use.4) Value. Not the cheapest, but give a great bang for the buck.Cons:1) Slower to adjust, relatively. Some changes require moving 4-adjustment levers on each dumbbell, depending on what weight you are switching between. A single or double dial is quicker, no doubt. But, note that I said ""relatively"". They really only take a couple of seconds to adjust, and it has been a non factor in my workouts.2) Missing some weight choices. You can add 2.5-lb or 5-lb to the coarse 10-lb, 20-lb, 30-lb, 40-lb, 50-lb settings. So you can do 12.5-lb & 15-lb, but not 17.5-lb, etc. The next increment after 15-lb is 20-lb. You could fudge around this by selecting an uneven amount to each end of the dumbbell, which would make them unbalanced by 2.5-lbs and give you a 7.5-lb increment. But I don\'t suggest doing that. For me, the increments are fine enough for what I do, and I move up and down in 5-lb amounts anyway.3) maybe more fragile than fixed weights? This is actually a comment that applies to probably all adjustable dumbbells, simply because they have a selection mechanism added to them. These do not appear fragile in the absolute sense, but I have no plans to drop them the way you see some guys do with fixed weights at the gym.I researched buying these quite a bit, and narrowed it down to several contenders. The Bowflex dumbbells were one finalist, and are undeniably slick, with the one-knob adjustment system. But, they (and some others) have a disqualifying flaw (in my opinion) where the dumbbell bar is always full length, regardless of how much weight you\'ve selected. Even at whatever their minimum is, you are swinging around like a two-foot rod with each arm.Anyway, I\'m a happy customer, and these are working great.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 30, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Best adjustable dumbbells', 'author': 'Koyfish', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""Why buy this product over the Bowflex 552 model and other types such as the Core Fitness?Most adjustable dumbbells can change weights easily. There are videos comparing the time it takes to change weights. Deciding to buy a particular type just because it is 1 second faster is silly.All are quick. You should decide to buy based on the following criteria: (1) handle feel and grip; (2) incremental weight options; (3) max weight needed; and (4) size of dumbbell.1. handle feel and grip ‚Äì the Bowflex grip is made of rubber and textured ‚Äì no slippage. The Nordictrack (orange model) has a metal grip similar to grips found on regular dumbbells. I have handled both and I think the Nordictrack is better in this area.2. Incremental weight options ‚Äì be careful in choosing. Some adjustables like the Core Fitness which use the twist handle to increase the weight ‚Äì will increase it by 5 lbs. That is a lot of weight to add when you are doing bicep exercises. This is where the Bowflex and the Nordictrack adjustables are superior. The Bowflex starts at 5 lbs and increases by 2.5 lbs until you get to 25 lbs (5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, 15, 17.5 20, 22.5), then it increases in 5 lbs increments (30,35,40,45,50,55 lbs). The Nordictrack starts at 10lbs and can increase to 12.5 then to 15 lbs then it jumps to 20 lbs. After 20 lbs you can increase it as follows ( 22.5, 25, 30, 32.5, 35, 40, 42.5, 45, 50, 52.5, 55 lbs). This means that the Bowflex has more adjustable increments between 5lbs and 25 lbs, while the Nordictrack has more adjustable increments between 20lbs and 55 lbs. So if you are going to always use the smaller weight amounts and need that lower increments there ‚Äì maybe the Bowflex is better for you. For me, I didn't mind that the Nordictrack started at 10 lbs and I wanted the more adjustable increments at the mid to higher weight ranges. My opinion is that the Nordictrack adjustables are better because of the continuous incremental weight adjustments all throughout the weights.3. Max weight needed. Most of the adjustable dumbbells only go up to 55 lbs. If you need more then look elsewhere such as the Bowflex 1090. For most people, the 55 lbs max limit is probably more than enough weight to do all of your dumbbell exercises.4. Size of dumbbell. Take a look at videos of the Bowflex adjustables. Even if you are using them as a 5 lbs weight you are picking up the entire outer portion of the dumbbell which states the length is 15.75 inches long. If you are using them to do a chest press ‚Äì you cannot bring your arms close together at the top of the press because of the length of each of the dumbbells. Here is where the Nordictrack dumbbells shine. If you are picking up the lightest weight (10 lbs) you are only picking up the inner most weights and each dumbbell will measure about 9 inches. The Nordictrack design makes for a superior compact and usable dumbbell.In my opinion the Nordictrack adjustable dumbbell is the best adjustable dumbbell out in the market at this time. I bought mine for $325.00. Don't know why they jumped in price. But at the price I bought them, they are well worth the price."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2021', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Hidden Gem in Adjustable Dumbbells!!', 'author': 'ClimbAnyMountain', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I discovered these after seeing a very positive review on YouTube.

(5) Solid quality feel to the weights.Pro Tip: Mount these to a stand so you don\'t have to bend down to the floor to pick them up, especially at the heavier settings. I bought a cheap harbor freight universal tool stand and added a wood top. To secure the NordicTrack cradles to the wood top I cut slots in the wood top and used Velcro One-Wrap 15"" x 1/2"" thin ties that I threaded through the 4 pre-existing slots can be found on each plastic cradle. 1/2"" wide zip ties would also be another way to go.

The only way you would is with a single weight dumbbell set which will most likely cost around the same if not more. The weights are a bit wobbly when moved around but nothing that will interfere with a workout. I does have me questioning the overall sturdiness. I can‚Äôt imagine maximizing out in reps and just dropping them. You could only do that on a padded area and it‚Äôs probably going to considerably lessen the lifespan of the weights if not outright break the various moving parts that probably aren‚Äôt repairable to the average person if at all due to it being a unique item with its own specific parts. The levers yo change weights can be a pain but you will get the hang of it and you can switch between weight easy and quickly enough. The levers do seem like if you wanted to you could break the off with minimal effort. So if you‚Äôre angry lifting stick to one weight till you calm down. Make sure you figure out the trick to adjusting the levers and you should be fine. I haven‚Äôt been able to find any feed back on this model. There‚Äôs another model norditrack makes that I saw a YouTube video that said they break easily. And many comments to reinforce that including breaking on the first use.

Firstly I am very impressed with the shipping of these! The product box is over 110lbs and there was NO physical damage to the exterior or interior, I have no idea how they handled this dumbbell box so carefully. I fully expected tons of damage inside and out, so 5 stars there.Now I haven't put these through their paces just yet, but wanted to give an initial impression after playing around with weight selection and doing a few quick and light exercises to see how they feel. Bear in mind this is my first ever set of adjustable dumbbells, and if you are reading this in this future, we are still in the middle of the covid pandemic and finding any weights at all is difficult, much less a set like these and at MSRP no less ($329).1) Weight Selection - First impressions here is slightly mixed. The selection itself is obvious enough though, the outside pin you pull up and drag and drop to wherever you want your heavy weight (10lbs, 20lbs, 30lbs, etc). The inside pin you pull up and drag to the front for 5lbs extra, back for 2.5 lbs, or middle for no extra. So getting from 10lbs, 12.5lbs and 15lbs is very obvious and straight forward. My concern is the selector pin handle is just a plastic piece, so I'm interested to see how this holds up over time. But the pin itself is metal so hopefully that lasts. Also when selecting your base heavy weight, the pin tends to get stuck sometimes when moving back and forth. Not a huge deal, but again I haven't gone through a full workout to see if this becomes annoying or not.2) Dumbbell Feel - As stated this is my first set of adjustable dumbbells. I've used plenty of standard hex dumbbells in the past and have always enjoyed lifting those. These definitely feel a bit different when lifting versus standard hex dumbbells. There is a slight wiggle to the plates and some click-clacking sounds when lifting. Very slight, but noticeable. The metal handles are nice though, they have a nice knurling and good grip, so solid marks there. So far I think they seem perfectly fine though, especially considering these 2 dumbbells are replacing like 10+ pairs of normal ones.3) Durability - Only time will tell here. I am concerned that there is only a 90day mfg warranty... I never like seeing that for any product ever. If you don't want to guarantee your product for even 1 year, that's a straight red flag. Especially with something like this, that costs $$$, I would hope to get many years of use out of them. I will certainly treat these with kids gloves, make sure I am gentle with the adjustor pins, definitely not dropping these or tossing them around, not going to use them for pushups, etc. I should mention that the plates themselves are a heavy plastic, not metal or rubber, so I don't think they would survive much impact.I'll come back and update this review after 30 days. I felt it was important to give an early impressions of these. When I bought these dumbbells, they literally sold out just later that day, and I see 3rd party resellers (SCALPERS) selling these things for $500+... DO NOT BUY THOSE!!! I paid $329 shipped, so PLEASE do not buy from any of these scalpers, they bought the product, so maybe they can use them as intended instead of taking advantage of this screwed up global situation were all in. Those a-holes are ruining many peoples hobbies and interests by doing that crap, so do not support them.Lastly, I have no idea if this is a genuine NordicTrack product. I've seen people on this page say they are brand new, and others say they are old and discontinued. The packaging doesn't really indicate much. There is NordicTrack branding on the shipping box and on stickers for the dumbbells. They are manufactured by the company that makes NordicTrack products though, so at least that's something. Regardless, I think the value for money is there if you can buy them at MSRP.EDIT (39 days later):After having used these dumbbells about 4-5 days a week since I got them, I can definitely say this was a solid purchase. Super convenient, weight selection is very nice and quick, no major gripes at all. However, as I stated some concerns in durability above... that is still very much a concern. There's been a couple of times where the inner 5lb weight would not attach to the pin, had to pull the dumbbell out and reset it to get it working properly. And I would still caution against using these for exercises like man makers or anything similar. I almost want to try it, but have the feeling these things would be toast in a couple of months if I did that. So these are not perfect for all workouts, but for general purpose lifting I definitely recommend.P.S.

Both are 10-55 pounds, made by NordicTrack, and bear the ""Select-a-Weight"" name (although sometimes they call the blue ones ""Speed Weights"" and the orange ones don\'t show up on the NordicTrack site - NordicTrack, what\'s going on with you all?)Material: The orange ones seem to be mostly metal, while the blue ones are mostly plastic. The orange has a metal, knurled handle. And the 10-pound weights are metal on the orange as well. The blue has a plastic handle and plastic weights. The blue doesn\'t feel bad, but the orange feels more premium. On both of them, the two 2.5-pound weights seem to be plastic, although the orange ones are smaller/thicker chunks versus taller/thinner chunks on the blue.Size: The orange ones are more compact overall with uniform plate sizes throughout. Whether you are lifting 10 or 55 pounds, the diameter is the same. The blue ones start wider at the 10-pound size and get narrower as you add weight. The orange design makes it easier for certain movements as well as when you want to rest the weights on your calves during certain bench lifts. Length is basically the same for both models.Other Design Aspects: The orange one has two 2.5-pound weights that stack/nest in each other. The blue one has two thin 2.5-pound plates that rest next to each other. I\'ve occasionally had a hard time lining up the weights with the blue\'s 2.5-pound weights still in the tray, and I have a feeling that the orange one\'s design will be easier to align. The blue ones have a handy reference on the weight itself about where to put the slider for 2.5 or 5 pounds; the orange ones do not have any indicator on the weights. Without that indicator, you might find yourself occasionally forgetting where to put the slider for 0, 2.5, or 5 pounds on the orange.Shape: The orange ones are mostly circular, with a small flat bit on the bottom to minimize rolling. The blue ones have a more angular shape across the entire design. The blue\'s angular shape might make certain floor exercises easier.Overall, I\'d say that the orange design is a pretty good improvement in most areas over the blue. I definitely like the feel of the metal more than the plastic, and like the more compact size. There are little touches about the blue ones (like the 0, 2.5, and 5-pound indicator) that I\'ll miss. Honestly, though, whether you get the blue or the orange, you\'ll be happy.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 21, 2021', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars A worthwhile compromise for the money', 'author': 'Ryan D.', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'I have owned these for over 6 months now. I spent a lot of time searching for a weight set that would allow me to cover a wide range of my workouts without breaking the bank on a full rack of dumbbells. I watched hours of reviews on the different options from bowflex, nuobell, flybird, etc. Please know that for my specific use case, I needed a range of weight, but I am not a gym fanatic. I workout a few days a week, and I just needed something that had good value.Pros: for the price, this set does the job well. Ranging from 10lbs to 55lbs, it allows me to hit a good range of weight exercises. The adjustment of the weights is easy and straightforward, and the grip is metallic and etched with a good grip surface. It feels good in the hand, and you can rotate the weight upside-down without worrying about a weight falling off and hitting you in the head. The holder for the weight does a good job of keeping them solidly in place.Cons: the weight portion of the dumbbell is plastic, and you can see from my picture that the mold is not perfect. One of the 5lb weight rings on one of the dumbbells seems to have been press molded in a way where it doesn\'t sit flush with the rest of the weight portion. It is annoying and quickly became noticeable. The time it takes to adjust the weight is not ""super quick"" like you see with a Nuobell; there are a number of clicks needed to reach the specified weight, and the be honest, the separate little 5lb mini adjustment is kind of odd, but can be convenient if you need a bit more weight for a set. My biggest complaint is the fact that the base holder of the dumbbell is ambiguously labeled. The small adjustment for each weight is a 2.5/5lb adjustment left or right. There is no way to tell by looking at the dumbbell which one (2.5 or 5) is activated, and the base has a labeling system but does not tell you which side is 2.5 or 5lb active. So you have to pick up the weight to understand if you\'ve got one engaged over the other. And sometimes in the middle of a workout, that little ambiguity and having to pick up and put back down to get the right weight is annoying. That and the fact that you *have* to have the weight on the base in order to adjust any weight at all.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 30, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Great all in one dumbell set', 'author': 'Jason Eng', 'rating': 4, 'content': ""These work great.

So if you need to switch mid workout, you'll have to pause for 10 seconds. Not the biggest thing in the world. Also, mine seemed to come with one dumbbell having an extra piece of plastic blocking the space between one weight and the other.

The handle is comfortable and has a good ergonomic feel to it with a nice rubber grip that isn't tacky or sticky. The weight selection mechanism is smooth and seems to be very reliable with no issues through several uses. I put mine on the pictured shelf because the typical dumbbell stands for these take up nearly as much room on the floor as my old multi-dumbell rack for the hex-heads I got rid of, so an equally large rack for a single set would defeat much of the purpose of buying these, and the shelf allows for extra storage on the ground unlike most of the stands. Also note when considering a stand/rack that these dumbbells have to be on a level surface, or the remaining plates that aren't being used will tip over when the handle is not connected, so be aware that some stands/racks have an inclined surface. There is the issue of the dumbbells sticking to the dumbbell holder when using the full amount of weight, so I zip tied the holders to the wire rack.

Long story short, I would not recommend these and I am sending them back after 1.5 workouts (yes, I put them away halfway through, that‚Äôs how bad they were).Pros: Very easy to switch out the weights with one hand, exactly as advertised. I put them on my bathroom scale, and the weight of each piece was accurate. Arrived quickly and well packaged, although I did need to tighten all screws before use.Cons: The plastic is extremely cheap. They make a creaking noise with all movement (this is not the individual weights sliding around, but the handle itself). There is no way I would use these as push-up bars and I was scared when holding them over my face. The handle is smooth and gets slippery when I start to sweat. The weights are huge! I know they listed the dimensions, but you don‚Äôt really appreciate it until you start working with them. With all weights attached, they are too long, twice the length of my traditional five pound dumbbell. This becomes a problem with certain exercises (for example, can‚Äôt do an upright row with good form). With all weights off, they are still too bulky, so large, quick Pilates movements become cumbersome. They are too wide, making two handed single dumbbell exercises impossible for someone with small hands. The edges are sharp and cut into my yoga mat. Although the idea of having such a wide variety of weights sounds appealing, they take up more space than my traditional dumbbell set. Oh, and they are extremely static-y, attracting all hair and dust bunnies (not a deal breaker, but just one more flaw).All in all, good idea, but cheaply made and could not be used in the way I wanted.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States November 4, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Looking for a while', 'author': 'Katherine', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I was looking for a long time this kind of dumbells and all of them always were too expensive.

I just got the connecting bar this week and it's even better than I expected. It feels very sturdy and durable. The outside grips are the same as the dumbbells but the middle part is more squishy, which makes it more comfortable if you want to put it on your shoulders for squats or on your hips for hip thrusts. Only thing that would be nice is if there was a recommendation for the max weight you can put on the bar but I'm not too concerned since it feels really solid.‚ÄîUPDATE: June 9, 2021 (30lb dumbbells)Still really love my 10lb dumbbells!!

Also seems to be pretty durable.- I like that there aren't too many weights to deal with and they're super easy to get on and off.- The seller advertises 4 different weight configurations (5lb, 7lb, 8lb, 10lb) but you can also do 3lb if you flip the middle weights and just screw those on. Because I'm just starting out using weights I appreciated having that option in the beginning.Cons:- Scratches easily and fingerprints are pretty apparent.- After just 2 weeks the logo was starting to rub off. It was kind of annoying/distracting during my workout so I ended up rubbing off the logos entirely. Not a big deal to me though.Side note: based on the photos for the 10lb dumbbells at the time I purchased, I expected to get the red grip but received a blue one.

I didn\'t have a problem with them, even though they delivered my dumbbells 2 days after the delivery estimate(can\'t complain, free shipping). Fedex Smartpost sends to the closest USPS, then USPS takes an additional 2 days to deliver. It seems like most people hate Fedex Smartpost because they take longer than usual(""google fedex smartpost sucks"" to see what I\'m talking about). I ordered these on 2-9-13 and they arrived at my doorstep on 2-16-13, so one week exactly, average time for free shipping. The dumbbells came packaged professionally and my case came in perfect condition, which I was very pleased about.I also ordered 60 pound db set from Lion Roar Fitness on 2-8-13, and as of 2-16, they didn\'t even start shipping so I ended up cancelling that order. They charged $20 for shipping too... I will NEVER even consider buying from LRF again. Just wanted to warn you guys about that. $20 for shipping AND they lag it? No thank you.These Dumbbell sets are a great investment, and I know they will last a long time. First of all, there is no toxic chemical smell the negative reviewers mentioned. Not even the case it came with. They clearly have gotten better with quality control. I read ALL of the negative reviews and took a chance with these, and I am glad I did. My bars are all nicely polished, smooth, and the weights and collars fit accordingly. There are 4 pieces of rubber stoppers that help keep these weights in place, 2 in the middle of the bar and 2 that are connected to the collars, which does an excellent job. When you lift weights, you should never ""jerk"" through your workouts, but instead keep good form with nice controlled movements. That\'s how my workouts are, and the weights have not moved, rolled, clanked, at all. The only time the collars roll out, is when I twist them to change weights. I even put all the plates on one bar(30 lbs) and the weights/collars were still in place. People say these are not the best quality, but what more do you expect from a set of dumbbells? Good finish on the plates with a clean tough metal bar, which cannot rip as some rubber grip bars tend to rip after tightening the collars too much. Carefully put the plates on, or you could scratch/chip off the paint. If you don\'t like getting callouses on your hands, I recommend investing in gloves. I don\'t feel a thing with gloves on and can enjoy lifting weights without getting blisters. If you have Fat Gripz(check my review for Fat Gripz), you don\'t even need gloves. Those rubber suckers will cover it, and give you a much better workout.I will buy additional plates for these soon but before you guys do as well, try adding Fat Gripz to the bars with your normal workouts. It will give your workouts more of a challenge, and you will see some good results in your forearm strength. I wish I knew about them when I wrestled in high school..Long story short, don\'t listen to the negative reviews. Keep yourself in shape and buy these already!Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that the bars + collars does not equal 5 pounds(unless you are weighing both bars and 4 collars together). So you get about 17.5 pounds each dumbbell. The description states that they weigh 5 pounds but it\'s half. The case it comes with is about 5 or 6 pounds so that\'s where they kind of trick you. So if you do the math, 4 x 5lbs plate + 4 x 2.5 lbs plate + 2 x 2.5 collars & bar = 35 lbs + 5 lbs case = 40 lbs db set.. I\'m not going to knock off a star for that because I bought these knowing this information. We can always buy more plates, so no big deal.Thank you for reading my long review.

It's not perfect, but I'm not really sure that the imperfections matter for a product like this. So let's get the negatives out of the way first:- Yeah, they smell, as others have noted. It's nothing strange -- if you've ever been to a gym before, you already know this smell. They're metallic with additional chemical odors. For a basic sniff test, you won't notice much. But the smell does begin to accumulate after a few days in cramped quarters, so maybe they're not the best choice for a bedroom or tiny apartment. I suspect the smell will dissipate in time, but I don't know how long that will be.- The carrying case is cheap molded plastic, and there's a good chance yours will arrive with one or more corners dented. It's fine -- the cases aren't meant to be display items. They're meant to store the weights, and to give you a convenient way to lug them around when needed.- It's obvious that corners were cut in some regards. The rubber cushions on the bars are cheap, and could possibly fall off and get lost if you aren't attentive. Likewise, the rubber cushions within the screw-on collars can fall out. It's not a big deal if they do -- you just stick them back in. But these are obviously not advanced equipment. They were designed to be cheap and functional.That said, I don't think any of these cons really matter. Weights have one purpose in life -- to weigh something. Your muscles can't tell if you're holding twenty pounds of expensive metal or cheap metal. This particular set is very well priced, and they feel safe and sturdy. You don't have to worry about the collars wiggling loose, and they're adjustable down to 2.5 pound increments. I snagged two sets, giving me greater versatility and the ability to put more weight on a single bar if needed. For the price, this is a perfect way to get started with a cheap, space-saving home gym.Weights don't need to be pretty and fancy to work. They just need to give gravity something to act on. You can buy fancier equipment than this, but it's not clear why you'd really want to."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 3, 2014', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Honest review addressing common concerns...', 'author': 'Bleacherbum95', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'When originally considering this product I was very concerned with the number of negative reviews/comments that people were leaving about these dumbbells. After deciding to take the risk, I felt the need to write a review since I believe that the negative reviews are overblown and overly dramatic. I will hopefully address the main concerns that you as the prospective buyer are having while considering this product. If you don\'t care about the details I have a TLDR at the bottom =)1. Smell: These weights do not smells like daisies; no dumbbells do. However, the smell is NOT as bad as people are saying. I would highly recommend leaving these weights outside (and/or washing them) to let them air out and control the smell, but it is not immediately overpowering. When the package arrived I slowly opened the box waiting for a toxic stench to explode out, but it never came. It was not until I lifted a plate out of the box that I noticed the smell people mentioned (the chemical applied to prevent rust), and it was not very strong. I left mine in the garage to air out and noticed a slight change in the smell of the garage, but nothing extreme. I would certainly keep them out of the house to be safe, but for $40 a quick wash or airing out was worth it to me.2: Quality: If you are looking for professional dumbbells that are made of top quality materials then look elsewhere. But if you are looking for a solid set of starter weights, this is your product. I will say that the first time I removed a collar a small piece of metal broke off, but it did not affect the functionality of the piece. Also, I noticed someone mentioned that the collar lets the weights slide...this was incorrect in my experience. The collars seem to hold the weights snugly in place, so there should be no problems there. The quality is by no means great (unbeatable for the price though), but it is good enough that I trust it will last and serve its purpose.3. Case: I saw a few people talking about how the case broke easily. The case seems fairly sturdy if it is treated well. A case breaking or not will depend on your delivery man. The weights are packaged very well inside a few boxes (Amazon ships it out in an excessively large box), and in my experience there were no cracks. The sliders to keep the box closed seem pretty lame, but I\'m one of those people who isn\'t going to sweat it if the case breaks.I hope I covered the main concerns that most people were having. My honest review of this product is that this is unbeatable for the price. $40 with free shipping (mine came in 2 days) is great, and these are exactly what I was looking for. And NO I was not paid for this review and think Amazon should be ashamed of including paid reviews.TLDR: Does NOT smell that bad (easily fixed), decent quality, best bang for the buck for somebody looking for starter dumbbells.UPDATE 1/25/14: I now have two sets of these (it was cheaper than buying weight individually), and they are holding up great after over a year and a half of use. I\'ve noticed the collar shifts slightly when you get over 30lbs, but never enough that it\'s a problem. Be confident in purchasing these as starter weights.UPDATE 7/31/16: My original bars are still going strong. The collar shifting still happens on occasion, but not to the point where it interferes with my workout. I\'ve purchased additional plates for it and added them just fine - any 1"" plate should fit just as well as the originals. So these have held up strong for 4 years...zero complaints here. One thing I forgot in the original review - you may want some lifting gloves. The metals isn\'t forgiving on your hands, so if you don\'t want big calluses, invest in a cheap pair of gloves.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States June 2, 2012', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great Adjustible Weight Set', 'author': 'Lumbre', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'First of all, let\'s get the smell part clear. Yes, it smells. It smells similar to the stuff you find in the tire/automotive aisles at Target/WalMart/other stores. Yes, it can be a bit strong. Let it air for a day and put a dryer sheet in the case when you close it. Problem solved. If you\'re picky on having your home smell like candles or something, these are not for you. If you don\'t even notice the smell of a gym when you\'re in a gym (or aren\'t the quickest to pick up on smells), then you\'re fine. Also, I think it\'s the box that smells, not any of the paint.Pros:*It is easy to add/remove weights. Just unscrew the collars, remove/add weights, screw collars back in. You can do this while resting in less than a minute.*You can add your own weights. When you outgrow these, you can add your own weights (doesn\'t have to be the same brand). Any generic 1"" weight will do.*When I bought these, they were awesome for $40. Under $1/pound if you count the different combinations of weights you can do and that you can add more later.*Cheap compared to buying individually.Cons:*Slight bump in one of the corners of the case. No big deal. Contents inside are fine. Just an aesthetic issue.*Smell. As addressed above, it can be a bit overpowering, but just take the time to let them air out. Some people also do fine by rinsing them.*They\'re not neoprene.Notes & Thoughts:*A lot of people complain about the default California warning added to this set. Seriously, California is overprotective. Drinking dozens of gallons of water is known to cause death. If ingested, gasoline can destroy your organs. Too much sun can give you cancer. They have these warnings on a ton of things for sale in California. Something containing nickel, for example, automatically gets this warning. If it were more serious, more states or the entire country would place a warning or they would be getting sued for giving people cancer (it\'s not like lawyers are exactly shy).*The handles may be a bit too textured for some people, especially those with delicate hands or buying more weights. In that case, maybe you should buy weight-lifting gloves. For those who don\'t mind getting scuffed by sand or falling hands-first on pavement, you\'re fine. If anything, I shift my hands around on the bar which varies up my routine a bit.*People say it\'s a good starter set. I just started a serious workout routine and have had this for a month. I see myself having this for years.*A few have complained that the weights aren\'t exact. The bar doesn\'t seem like 5 pounds, but when I weight myself with one of my 20 lb. dumbbells, I see my weight increase by 19.8 or 20 (my scale goes in intervals of 0.2). It\'s close enough for me. I don\'t need it to be that exact.*Mine didn\'t seem to have any loose seal rings or collars. They seem good for the price. They may shift a small amount after a 30 minute workout to where you can hear a slight clunk.

While most iron free-weights sell for around $2/pound (as of the fall of 2022), this set is much more affordable,The price for it does seem to vary wildly day by day. I paid $77 in October 2022 and see that a month later, it is selling for $65. But I‚Äôm not complaining since it‚Äôs a steal at either price.I bought 2 sets so I‚Äôd have a pair of dumbbells.The dumbbell bars and threaded, star-shaped end nuts are nicely made. The chrome coating seems thick and durable. And because the threaded nuts have black rubber washers on the side that makes contact with the weight plates, they tighten securely and stay firmly in place when in use. Other sets I‚Äôve used did not have the rubber washer and as a result, would loosen up while doing reps. That‚Äôs both annoying and dangerousThe rubber washers do tend to fall off when removing the nuts from the dumbbell, but that is easily rectified by putting a few drops of superglue in the groove in the nut into which the rubber washer sits.The weight plates themselves are a little less precisely made. For instance, I weighed my 5 lb plates on a postal scale and discovered they range anywhere from 4.75 lbs to 5.25 lbs. That‚Äôs not a big deal most of the time but you can definitely notice an imbalance if you inadvertently end up with 8 of the heavier 5 lb plates on one hand and 8 of the lighter plates on the other.To avoid that from happening, I used a silver Sharpie to mark the plate that are over 5 lbs and keep them in a separate pile so I can distribute the weight more evenly into the bars.Also, while the clear-coat on the plates seems heavy duty enough, you do need to check for rough edges. That goes for the dumbbell bars too. I had to file down a couple of spots to avoid getting metal splinters in my hands.Last but not least, the dumbbells I received have a diameter of 1.18 inches (or 30mm) and the weight plates have holes that size. This means any plates you may already have with 1 inch (25mm) holes will not fit onto these bars. Likewise, while the plates from this set will easily go onto a 1 inch bar, they can flop around a bit. In practice the latter is not a problem as long as you can tighten down the bar-end clamps. I use my 30mm plates on a 25mm curl bar without issue.In short, while there may be some compromises involved, at these prices, this dumbbell set is one of the best deals out there.Follow up note written on April 11, 2023:I‚Äôve been using my weight set several times a week for about 6 months now and all parts are holding up great!', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States November 28, 2022', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Really like these', 'author': 'Amazon Customer', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I needed a set to get started with.

In my case, while extremely heavy duty boxes were used, and well taped, one of the boxes was sliced open and minor damage to rubber ends of DBs in that box occurred. Looks like it was slid over something which cut it through.In any event, 2x5, 2x10, 2x15, 2x20, 2x25# DBs are included, making this an excellent ""base"" set. Handles are knurled and as expected in diameter and abrasiveness. No gloves required, but your mileage may vary.Is there a smell? seems to be the burning question. Of course they have a smell. They were just born of chemicals. They smell like what they are: rubber. So if you have ever had a new bike tire in your house, that is the smell, multiplied by a few pairs. It doesn\'t bother me in the slightest, and I was able to start using right away. I cannot relate at all to folks who seemed like they were going to swoon after opening the boxes.NOTE: I ""washed"" these with dish soap and water before using because they are covered in manufacturing residual dust etc. and will make your hands filthy otherwise. Mine did *not* have any kind of oily residues, as others have mentioned; again, just new tire smell, which for me is not obnoxious. But hey- some people think cilantro tastes terrible, so there is no accounting for taste.NOTE #2: Unlike the way Amazon\'s own brand and some other DBs I have purchased are wrapped, these were just loose in the box. No Styrofoam, no placement in a baggie, nada. Just in the box. So they are not going to be 100% brand new and flawless looking when you take them out. Get over it. They\'re dumbbells. They\'ll look like that in a couple months of workouts anyway. Also, because there is no protection, be judicious in opening the boxes. Just slice around the tape so you are not gouging a chunk out of your new best friends.I got these for basically a buck a pound, which is what weights were before Covid, and what they should be anyway, and held off on buying them until I hit the sale amount. Having said that, they would still be worth it for the $200 amount too, of course, just slightly less of a bargain.As has been mentioned by other reviewers, the A-frame is easy to put together, but will take your fingers off if you are not watching what you are doing when replacing the weights onto the rack, something which was also true at many gyms I have used and is a bug and not a feature of this style of rack.Definitely recommend, and would purchase again. Plan on augmenting with additional weights and eventually using a horizontal rack for all of them, but this was a steal-- and delivered on top of it.I am keeping the boxes. These are some of the heaviest duty boxes I have had sent to me. You should keep them until your return date is over anyway, in the event something untoward happens and they need to go back.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 14, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Absolutely worth the price', 'author': 'Amazon Customer', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""TL;DRYou can't go wrong with this weight set for the money. I got them on a flash sale for under $180.The good: Easy to assemble, sturdy stand, nice grips on the weights. Company will send free replacements if anything is wrong in the shipment.The not-so-good: Rubber smell upon opening, will need some time to dissipate, so I'd plan on leaving them sit in a well ventilated area for a week before seriously using them. Also, the ends would appear to be dipped to rubberize them, and some of the material splashed onto the chrome handles. Absolutely no big deal and can be cleaned off, but something to be aware of. I would also suspect this material would wear off and expose the metal if abused (particularly if it got dropped on the corner of something).I have no idea how they make money on these as they came to me in 4 separate boxes via UPS.

To be able to lift weights at home is life changing. I had this exact set (60 lb set), lost it in a move, and just replaced it.IMPORTANT: Watch the plates as you lift during and between sets. The collars can shift, weight and motion of the plates can relatively quickly come off and liable to drop a plate during a set, which could crush your foot or face depending on what you're doing. I had the 8lb plate fall off while doing standing dumbbell curls and thank goodness it missed my foot by a few inches. Just always be looking at the collars AS you lift, and tighten them back between sets. I believe it is partly because the threads on the bars are sparse and wide; a more finely densely threaded bar and collar design might prevent slipping (in case manufacturer is reading this). The little tightening screws on the collar are not engineered well enough to handle the plate weight and motion. It is a risk to use these dumbbells but IT IS WORTH using them despite the risk. Be watchful and frequently tighten collars between sets or even during a set of you need to. Keep Lifting!!!!Much more versatile and less expensive than buying various fixed weights.60 lb set includes:2x dumbbell bars at 4lb each4x 8lb plates4x 5lb plates4x screw on collars to secure the weights onto the barsKeep in mind each bar weighs 4 lbs, so if you load them evenly, you'll have, in each hand:2x 8 lb plates = 16 lbs2x 5 lb plates = 10 lbs1x 4lb bar = 4 lbsTotal for each hand = 30 lbsKeep in mind you can increase the weight too if you want to do some workouts with just one barbell, which is perfectly fine. Ie load a dumbbell to 56 lbs and just do one arm at a time, or for heavy tricep press etc.The set came very well packaged in tight fitting foam, nothing sliding around, and in perfect condition (see photo).The box also has a glossy instructions pamphlet which shows a a good variety of exercises, in case you are just starting out as a weight lifter.This is a very well made set, high quality steel bars and quality plates, although the plates are traditional and don't have rubberized coating, so I suggest getting some good dense rubber or foam floor mats if you're using these on hardwood floor to avoid dinging the wood or maybe even if on concrete if you're worried about clanging when you set them down (or just put them down gently and don't just drop em like some people do at the gym).This 60 lb set is absolutely perfect and fine for anyone from a beginner to a fairly fit man, especially considering you can load one bell higher than 30lbs and alternate arms.You can always buy more plates to stack on the bars if you get to that point, but if you have this set as well as a barbell set and power cage, you are SET to get RIPPED.

I have had absolutely no metal shavings come off the bar. Some people have complained that metal shavings and splinters were all over the floor where the dumbbells are used and even got splinters in their hands. Maybe the product has been improved but I haven't experienced any such problems. Second, others have complained that the paint has come off the plates. Again, I haven't experienced that at all and, even if I did, I wouldn't care. After all, they're just weights. But the paint on mine has not fallen off at all. In my opinion, complaints about chips and dents on the surface of the plates is trivial even if there are chips and dents. Again, we're talking about weights. Also, I haven't had problems with the spin-on collars with the exception of one slightly loosening when I was doing fast curls but I simply tightened it down a bit more and I haven't had any problems since but it really wasn't a problem then because it only loosened slightly and wasn't anywhere near the end of the bar. It just caused a slight rattle which I haven't experienced since simply tightening the collars down a bit more.If there was one thing that I could criticize - and this is VERY MINOR thing - it would be that I would have liked the bars (where your hands go) to be slightly larger because I have large hands. But I must stress that this is such a minor thing that I was hesitant to even mention it. If I thought it was a problem, I could easily rectify it but it's not worth bothering with.I just ignored complaints by reviewers who complained that they didn't get the total pounds for EACH dumbbell that was listed for the set.

After reading all the reviews and performing much research, I decided to purchase this dumbbell set, rack and mat combo. I was worried about what the quality would actually be like, if all the dumbbells fit on the rack or if anything would arrive damaged. Happily, my order arrived quickly, delivered by freight truck and dropped right outside my garage. I looked over everything and it all appeared to be intact and all there as described and I brought it all box by box down to the basement.A day later I constructed the rack which I found to be both sturdy and strong with no scratches or issues despite the shipping box having ripped open in shipping transit. I unpacked the dumbbells and set them on the rack and was impressed by the beauty and quality of them. There was a rubber smell but that is to be expected and it was not overwhelming as some reported and the smell dissipated soon after a week. In the unpacking and racking I unfortunately discovered that one of the 20 lb weights has incurred damage on the rubber outer coating. The shipping box had a hole that had been taped and this damage was not due to the product manufacturer but by the freight shipping company. I contacted the seller and they responded promptly and subsequently provided a return label for the damaged item and shipped out a replacement that I received very quickly.All in all, I have to personally recommend this set combo to anyone and though a trifle expensive, I found it all to be high in value and quality. The rack is terrific and all the dumbbells fit on it without crowding or any stability issues at all, I even had space to add an additional 10 lb. dumbbell set of my wife's on it. I'm very happy with my purchase and it's been a perfect, superb looking addition to my home gym and I use them regularly.

They feel pretty plasticy, but then they are plastic. The weights themselves and the actin of the buttons doesn\'t feel very robust to me, but for the price and from the pictures, I wasn\'t expecting them to be.I put the parts on a scale; the handles weigh 2.12 pounds, and each ""weight"" weighs in at .79 of a pound, a bit heavier than the half pound each one is marked. That means with two of them on a weight, instead of adding a pound, you add just over a pound and a half. It\'s not a problem, just something to be aware of.These are just what I needed to rehab my shoulders after injury. They\'re not heavy enough to build muscle with unless you\'re a beginner, but they\'re perfect for rehabbing after injury, and the lightness makes the a good option for someone who is frail or has been bedridden to work with.

The orange locks are secure (they are not going to get accidently moved and the weights are not going to randomly fall out), but they are relatively easy to push and even someone with moderate arthritis should have no issues.

I really did like them and didn't have a complaint until I was going up in weights. I began to max out on my deadlifts and began using all the weights. As you can see by the picture, if you go up to the max and use all the weights, their is very little room for the barbell to screw onto. I had the sense not to use that above my head but as it was, it broke while lifting my deadlifts. I had a cat nearby that nearly got it, not to mention my foot that it landed on. This truly could have been dangerous.If a product is advertised to be able to handle that weight, it should be sturdy enough and long enough to accomplish this. I can no longer use my barbell as a piece of the weight bar is stuck in it. I could use the barbell for other exercises with less weights, if there wasn't a piece of now stuck plastic in it.

Burke', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I have a set of 50lb Powerblock adjustable dumbbells that I use for workouts, but I wanted an adjustable kettlebell and a barbell. For the price, I wasn't expecting much but I am pleasantly surprised with this setup.It comes in a fairly compact box and the barbell needs to be assembled from three pieces (two bars and a joiner). I was concerned about the sturdiness of this, but it is locked together really well. The unit comes set up as a dumbbell and you need to reconfigure it for either the kettlebell or the barbell. The mechanism to set the weight works really well - you simply rotate the handle to select the weight. Once while I was changing weights, it started to get difficult to turn, but the instructions have a section on how to deal with that and specify not to force it - they show you how to reset the dumbbell. The markings reference the three setup options - barbell, dumbbell and kettlebell. It took a little getting used to before I could remember which was which, but I've got it now. Once you set a weight, you just lift it up and the plates are either attached or remain in the cradle based on what you picked.Switching between the modes isn't the easiest, so don't plan on being able to just change this up easily. It's not hard, but it's more involved than just setting a weight. There are magnetic pins that lock the handles into the weight ends. But since the cradles hold the weights into position, you need to remove the dumbbell from the cradles and remove the pins, then slide off the weight ends to change it up. You also need to modify the base, which isn't hard. The poles that hold the cradle ends just slip on and off easily, so you can easily turn it into a barbell or kettlebell cradle, but you need to set up the cradle and the barbell, kettlebell, etc. separately.The base could use a small set up in quality. It's fine as it is, but a simpler way to change modes would be helpful, and there's no rubber/anti-slip feet on it, so the base can slide around when trying to put the weights back in the cradle. A few rubber pads would help.The instructions are very clear and well written. Overall, I'm very happy with this set.

To add a weight, line a new plate flush to the side and slide down from the top with white buttons visible from the top. The plates slide into a V-shaped groove and clicks into place. The lock is a plastic tab that sticks out about 2mm and fits into a notch on the added plate. Pressing the top button makes the tab recede into the plate and lets you remove the adjoining plate.Keep in mind that these thin plastic tabs secure these weights when upside down, so it's wise to always keep the buttons facing upward.

One time, with my powerblocks I worked to failure and put them down rather hard and broke the weight selector pin. It was in expensive enough to replace, but it's really kind of scary that a thin piece of plastic is holding 90 lbs together.I've looked at Ironmasters and Pepin dumbbells. These are similar to those two brands and, in fact, they really remind me of a dumbbell from a company called Hoist, which I believe was manufactured by Ironmaster and it had the similar side slot for adding plates without removing everything.(A lot of companies manufacture for other brands. Powerblock also makes dumbbells for Hammerstrength).What I like most about my Eisenlinks is 1) I admittedly like to try new things, 2) The price and 3) The relatively quick change. Not as fast a the Powerblocks, but definitely faster than my other screw-on adjustable dumbbells.One thing to note is the length of the handle.My powerblocks have a 5 inch long handle.My generic adjustable dumbbells have a 6 inch handleThe Eisenlink handle is a whopping 6.75 inches long. I think this is needed to provide enough room for the internal screw system. .This hasn't caused any problems but it does make centering the dumbbells important. If you tend not to center them, they will tilt when doing bench presses or curls. It's important to center them.I think that these are great dumbbells, and what would make me rate them even higher (if higher than 5 stars was possible) is if Eisenlink follow through on their plans to release a barbell system as well as an expansion to bring these up to 120 lb.I tested my Eisenlink handle with 90 lbs (I took 10 lbs off one of the dumbbells and placed it on the other) for single arm dumbbell rows and it was very comfortable. I would not place 90 lbs over my head without longer screws and the manufacturer doesn't recommend doing this either. So, please come out with longer screws. :)All in all, these are great. I'm a bit OCD, so the rattling fo my Powerblocks really annoys me when I work out. This rattle happens with everything from Bowflex dumbbells to Nuobells. With these Eisenlinks, they feel like a single piece of metal during your workout. There is no rattling at all.One of my screws did arrive a bit scuffed and chipped and there was some kind of adhesive goo on it. I used goo gone and cleaned it up. The chrome finish was a bit chipped where the screw faces the plates, but this was only cosmetic damage. It cleaned up fine and the scratches will eventually be joined with more scratches from regular use. Weights are going to get scratched up. As nice as these look in new condition, I look forward to putting many scratches on them over the years, and from the way they feel, I believe that I'll be using them for a long time."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States July 15, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Durable, simple, versatile, and good value dumbbells', 'author': 'Topdog-182', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""All metal construction, so very durable. Simple design, so not quite as convenient perhaps as those adjustble dumbbells with dial or toggle type adjusting mechanisms; but I would counter that these more complex options have been often reviewed (in my research) as being sometimes unsafe overhead if improperly set; and sometimes that parts are more fragile because they are made of plastic. The Eisenlinks are still fairly easy to change up on the fly, tho I guess if your intending to change weight frequently, during a session, this might be too cumbersome for you. I like that this dumbbell design is quite compact and very solid, does not rattle, and finally, does not roll on the floor. I like that the individual plates are 5lbs each, and they provide a set of 2.5lb plates, so you can increase the weight in five pound increments. I dont like that he 2.5lb plates dont accept the 5lb plates' locking stubs, so have mount the 2.5lb plates in a specific orientation with the respect to the 5lb plates, making the assemblage a tiny bit more cumbersome to adjust.

I ordered the 50lbs and the 80lbs on the same day; the shipping ETA was a week - no problem; on the day of delivery, I received the 80lbs dumbbells and received a notification saying my expected delivery date for the 50lbs was going to be a delayed for the next day - no problem, I waited and still nothing. A few days go by and still no updates, and my order status goes from ""shipped"" to ""preparing for shipment"", so I contact Eisenlink customer service, their responses usually take a day as they are based overseas I think, and they told me, ""There is now one 50lbs dumbbell in stock and 11 in transit. This is the last inventory for the near future."" Seriously? That had not been the case on the day of the purchase because Amazon usually has a disclaimer if a product is low on stock, and even if it was, I was still charged for both of the dumbbells more than 2 weeks ago! So I go on the product page, which said there was 1 dumbbell left in stock and the same dumbbell was $40 more expensive, so I place the item in my cart and contact customer service about this and asked them if they could just ship that one dumbbell since I already have an outstanding order and instead of me having to pay an extra $40 increase in price, and I response I get is ""After investigation to confirm that our system is working properly but the order is not paid, we will ship the order only after confirming payment with the buyer. If no valid proof of payment is provided within the payment verification period, the order will be automatically canceled by Amazon."" There was no way that was true because the order for both dumbbells was placed and charged to my card on the same day! So I contact Amazon Customer Service, and they told me they would put priority on shipping this item out and reimburse me for the new item with the $40 difference once I repurchase the dumbbell. Can\'t argue, I did as they asked because I needed a second dumbbell ASAP and so the dumbbells arrived after a week with more problems‚Ä¶I opened both boxes on the same day, no damage to the box, everything was great. There were scratches, dents, and a bit of rust on the plates but that\'s inevitable due to shipping so I ignored it. The handle is a bit too long and may cause balance issues, and the knurling on it is almost nonexistent. I read through the manual to figure out how to properly change the weights and whatnot, and as I\'m taking the plates out, I realized the quality of the plates was getting worse and worse, especially on the 80lbs dumbbell, the texture of the plates were grittier with particles coming off, more scratches and rust and most of them had 2 small plates screws (round buckles) missing. I decided to weigh the plates and most fell within .1-2lbs, which is great, however, some plates were much worse, and more notably the handle, which is advertised as 10lbs each, one of them was 8lbs and the other was 7lbs, and the large screws, advertised as 2.5lbs each, are just 1lb. Odd, but I still used it, just not for any sort of pressing movement because it is a potential safety hazard without the buckles and it has been over 2 weeks since the purchase date without use, so I figured I\'d just return it if I had any issues.Later, I contact Eisenlink customer service and after some questions and pictures over a span of a week, they said they shipped out 6 small plate buckles, completely disregarding my request for a new handle. I didn\'t want to argue and the questions and responses would take longer so I agreed on it, and in two weeks, which was past my return period for the dumbbell, it arrived - and I installed them with an allen wrench like they advised, and everything was good.I treated the dumbbells with care, never dropped them, and always used it on rubber flooring; however, problems still persisted, rattling plates, black particles scraping off, and what I soon realized is that when you turn the round large screws to lock the plates in, it scratches the outer plates, which is always going to be the 2.5lbs plate, and the inside of the screws, and over time you\'ll need more turns to lock the plates in because it requires more grip.I never complained, however, a few days ago, as I was doing an incline chest press with 70lbs, I get up after my set and the large screw facing down loosens, and the plates slip out onto my thighs which caused me to drop the entire dumbbell onto my foot. 2 pairs of round buckles had come off the plates and my guess is it caused all the plates to slip out, and now I\'m left with an unsafe defective dumbbell and a bruised foot.The price is okay for these dumbbells but if you care for your safety and the longevity of the product you purchase, please go look for another pair of adjustable dumbells.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 21, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Best deal on dumbells out there!', 'author': 'Brian A.', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I bought a pair to try, figured I could return them if they weren't any good.

The price was steep coming in at just over $800 shipping (NOV 22) included to Hawaii but just the shear convenience of having 160lbs of dumbbells in my dinning room that takes up no more than a 3‚Äôx3‚Äô space is worth the cost. I was worried about the plastic parts that everyone was talking about that might break off and leave your dumbbells inoperable and upon first inspection of the dumbbells I was too but after continuous use I found it was nothing to worry about (also Nuobell sells parts if your break). If your a weight slammer and like to throw your weights back in the rack then you have a lot to worry about but if you take care of your equipment then this problem will go unnoticed. I recommend getting a rack like the one in the picture. This makes it easier to maneuver the dumbbells in and out of the holster. This rack seemed to me at first to be unstable because of just the one bar coming up from the base and it is a little wobbly but again after 14 months of use I have to issues with it.The weight change is still almost effortless and glides through the 5-80lb seamlessly with zero maintenance. There is a little slop in the weights a little rattle when using the dumbbells under 25lb but goes away when you use heavier weight. The only problem I‚Äôve come across now that I think about it was the kind of sharp edge digging into my forearm when doing over head Tricep extension. I just adjust my form and problem diverted.Not much else to say about these. They are sturdy, convenient and most of all reliable. My only major gripe is that I out grew these dumbbells hella fast because of the convenience of having them in literally arms reach rather than having to motivate myself to drive to the gym but I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs a good thing lol.Have recommended them to many and I recommend them to you as well.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 7, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent product and excellent customer support', 'author': 'Kappa', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I have been using the adjustable 50 pound core fitness dumbbells for about 8 years now and never had issue with them, other than they are limited in weight to only 50 pounds. I got the 80 pound adjustable nuobells as an upgrade, and boy are they awesome. When I first opened the box one of the dumbbell cradles had a cracked plastic part that made it more difficult to rerack the weight. However, after emailing customer support, they sent out a replacement cradle to me that same day and at no charge, and it arrived after about a week. I won't dock a star for the item being slightly damaged out of the box because sometimes it happens. Now onto the dumbbells...Pros-The cast iron plates just look and feel awesome. No issues with the plates feeling insecure and the plates themselves are very durable.I love the handles! The steel grip with the knurling feels like an actual gym dumbbell.The 80 pound max weight is such a game changer for me. While 80 isn't quite enough for some exercises (chest press, db rows, shrugs), it is still enough to get in the work I need.Huge space saver and much more economical than getting 16 different pairs of dumbbells.Cons-Some connector parts of the dumbbell are plastic and only time will tell how they hold up.You can't just drop these. Although it seems fairly durable, you will most certainly break the plastic connectors if you are carelessly throwing them around. Not that I would drop them anyways, but you just have to treat them with respect. If you want dumbbells you can abuse and drop, then you need solid cast iron or rubber coated ones.This product is an absolute must have for any home gym. The price point is very high, but this is absolutely worth it.Edit: I have been using these for over a year now and they have held up flawlessly. I frequently use the full 80 pound weight and the plastic connector pieces are showing no signs of wear. Just treat them with respect and as long as you arent dropping them or aggressively reracking them, they will hold up fine.

And I whole heartedly agree - they are great! When I showed them to my workout partner (my son), he exclaimed, ‚ÄúHoly Cow!!! These are incredible! So easy! So solid! How do they even get these to adjust!?‚ÄùMine was purchased via Amazon and fulfilled by authorized US retailer Finer Form (NuoBell is a Swedish company that exports with a few authorized US retailers). Two separate boxes with different tracking numbers arrived 5 days earlier than expected, a big plus. While the outside of one box was slightly ripped / torn in the middle (see photo), and both boxes had damaged and crushed pieces of the styrofoam casing (see photo), the actual handle, dumbbell weights, and dumbbell holders were surprisingly not damaged (see photo). The potential for damage and is there and I recommend that NuoBell update it's packaging (e.g. REP fitness does an INCREDIBLE job packaging and protecting their products so they don't arrive damaged). HOWEVER, there is a manufacturing quality control issue, as two of the weight plates had their powder coated finish blistered, and when I inspected the plates, the paint flaked away (see photo) and now those weight plates are exposed and will likely rust (our home gym is indoors, but there is a lot of moisture / humidity in the air as we are just inland from the ocean). Thus, I took off two stars on this review, one for each weight plate, on an otherwise five star product.See photos of the two weight plates that had blistered paint. I am happy to update my review if Finer Form contacts me and arranges to replace the two defective plates.Here are many PROS of the NuoBell dumbbells:‚Ä¢ They feel like regular dumbbells. When you adjust the weight, it grabs another plate on the outside most section and expands in width size. Most other adjustable dumbbells (including the Bowflex) have a fixed cage and don‚Äôt change in width size, even if you are only lifting 5 lbs, so you are working with a large dumbbell all the time. Not with the NuoBell - you only lift what you need to lift. If you choose a weight in a 5 lbs increment, the NuoBell actually leaves the 2.5 lbs plates located in the interior closest to the handle, along with additional unused weight's in the tray. If you select in10 lbs increment, you pick up that interior plate along with the needed outside plates, and the unneeded plates stay in the tray holder.‚Ä¢ The weight plates are round, flat, and comfortable, with good surface area. This is important because at heavier weight settings for seated lifting, you will place them on top of your quads and kick up your knee to help get each dumbbell to your shoulders for any overhead lifts .‚Ä¢ The handles are comfortable and have the right amount of knurling ‚Äì not too aggressive that they‚Äôll rip your skin, but a nice medium amount that give you good grip‚Ä¢ The weight change mechanism / rod is metal (see photo). I believe some of the earlier reviews complained that it was made of plastic. This 2022 version that I received is metal ‚Äì that is good because you don‚Äôt want the plastic to break when it‚Äôs carrying 60-80 lbs of weight plates, and metal will last longer than plastic as long as you don't let things rust.‚Ä¢ It's simple and easy to adjust ‚Äì turn the handle with ONE HAND until it clicks and shows the next weight increment in the window. There is no need to adjust two settings per dumbbell (e.g. MX Select and Bowflex dumbbells), fiddle with pegs or bands (e.g. PowerBlock dumbbells), etc. If you like to do CrossFit, HIIT, or other similar exercises where a fast weight change is needed, the speed and simplicity of changing NuoBell weight increments is by far the best. My son and I left different weights when we work out together, and changing from his weight setting to mine is easy and fast - that said, we are also both fairly careful about placing the dumbbells back in the tray correctly (see below Con point).‚Ä¢ You can increase weight in 5 lbs increments ‚Äì quickly change to 5, 10, 15, 20 etc. up to 70, 75, and 80 lbs. That is the same range you‚Äôd get if you had individual, fixed weight dumbbells, but you‚Äôd need to purchase 16 Sets / 32 dumbbells, and that would take up A LOTof space, cost you easily 3 times the price of the NuoBells, and you‚Äôd need a large rack to hold 32 dumbbells. Not really ideal if you are a garage gym owner or have a small to mid-size home gym.‚Ä¢ You can add two pair of Platemate 1.25 lbs magnetic fractional plates to go up in 2.5 lbs increments for each dumbbell, such as 17.5, 22.5, 27.5, 32.5, etc (Platemate recommends not adding magnetic plates to less than 20 lbs, and the 15 lbs setting with the NuoBell is the minimum setting where you get a full plate that has the required 4‚Äù x 4‚Äù contact area for the magnet of the Platemate). You can attach the Platemates to iron or steel individual dumbbells, and now they have an R-3 PlateMate that connects to the handle of rubber, urethane, & non-magnetic dumbbells. The Platemates stick really well to the NuoBells (almost too well - it takes a good amount of effort to carefully remove the Platemate).Here are the CONS to the NuoBell dumbbells:‚Ä¢ Quality control failed and two of the plates had bubbled powder coating paint which flaked off, exposing the iron underneath, which will rust.‚Ä¢ Designed in Sweden, but like almost the majority of products, made in China (similarly, REP and Titan are designed in US, manufactured in China). Some folks (including me), like high quality strength training products designed and made in the US, such as Bridge Built, Sorinex and Rogue.‚Ä¢ The weight change indicator and holding aperratus is made of plastic. Not necessarily bad, but if you drop these, you might break the plastic. That said, almost all adjustable dumbbells that I researched before purchasing the NuoBells have the same warning ‚Äì DO NOT drop. If you are planning to train to failure with heavy weights and regularly drop your dumbbells after a set, you are best served with individual rubber dumbbells. Either way, even when training to failure, you should have a spotter to make sure you keep proper form, and to help if you are going to drop or other issue. Solve this issue of not dropping the NuoBells and damaging them by working out with a spotter. That is Safety 101 with weight lifting.‚Ä¢ Heavy, with both dumbbells totaling 160 lbs plus the trays for each. I don‚Äôt think you need to spend $260 on the NuoBell stand (a strong, small table / rack or reinforced wall shelf properly anchored to wood studs can work). I recommend having these stored at hip height so you don't have to bend down to pick these up, and it's also easier to place them carefully back in the tray.‚Ä¢ Speaking of which, these need to be carefully placed back in the tray with the male/female sections connecting properly (and some other reviewers complain that the male/female connectors are plastic - I don't really find that an issue if you are careful). This is a downside feature of pretty much all adjustable dumbbells (with the exception of the PowerBlock). I am assuming that if you are forking out $745 for the NuoBell pair, you are going to naturally be careful and take care of these babies. So this is more of a niggle than a con.‚Ä¢ Some other reviewers complain that they can't get these to place back in the tray correctly, rendering them inoperable. Again, one needs to be careful. Place the dumbbell back in the tray one at a time, using one hand, so you can use the other hand to move the weight plates that remain in the tray as needed to fit the dumbbell back in. If the dumbbell is at a high weight setting, work with your spotter, they can help to make sure you return to tray properly. At the lower weights (50lbs or less),I find that returning to tray by myself one dumbbell at a time and on occasion shifting the weights in the tray a works just fine.Don‚Äôt trust just my review, go to YouTube > Garage Gym Reviews and check out all of Coop & friends objective and honest reviews of home gym equipment, including a reveiwing a large range of adjustable dumbbells. Coop of GGR is a big fan of the NuoBells. I am too (other than the bubbled powder coating issue‚Ä¶ did I mention there‚Äôs an issue with their QC and powder coating?).‚Ä¢ These aren't appropriate for weight lifters who need lots of weight, train to failure, etc. For 99% of us that aren't professional body builders and need something appropriate for our home gym, these are great and save a lot of space. If you are in that 1%, you will be much better served with individual pairs of fixed dumbbells, and you can purchase dumbbells weighing more than 80 lbs per dumbbell.So buy these already if you are looking for a set of quality, simple to use, robust adjustable dumbbells. You won‚Äôt regret it, and you‚Äôll enjoy your workouts much, much more."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 26, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great adjustable dumbbells for home gym', 'author': 'Tom H.', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I've had these for over a year now and use them at least three days a week, when I'm not traveling. I had built a pretty respectable home gym during COVID, but I was never happy with the dumbbells I had. I was a Marine until I retired in 2022 so maintaining the workout routine was important. Also, continuing to exercise in my new life as a civilian, and helping my son learn strength training to help with sports, is a goal of mine.I was using the spin-lock weights, which are OK for some things, but I hated them for doing heavier DB presses because you can't rest them on your thighs when starting or finishing. The thing I like about these, and the main reason I bought these instead of cheaper alternatives, is the fact the ends are flat and they get shorter as you lower the weight. Five to eighty pounds in 5-pound increments is also very versatile for whatever you are doing, and switching weights is very fast.I have no concerns about the durability during normal use. The mechanism seems as tight today as when I got them. Be aware, though, that these are not meant to be dropped like a set of rubberized 80s you would find at a gym. If you want to do that, then look elsewhere. You have to be careful not to go to complete failure during a chest workout.Overall I'm super happy with these and would highly recommend them."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 23, 2024', 'is_verified': True}]"

The weight set is about what I‚Äôd expect for the price.Update: The case is being re-sent and I‚Äôll update this once received. There was no ‚Äúextended foam vacuum connecting bar‚Äù attachment included in this set so that was removed from the advertisements which is much appreciated. Nothing has been said about the dumbbell with the plastic broken off. I asked about this again so will see what the response is. For the price and what is advertised in the photos I did expect better quality so will be disappointed if the one dumbbell is not replaced, the dumbbells should not have pieces of the handle broken off upon receipt which is leaving dust particles all over. I believe it was broken due to the lack of securing pieces for transfer. The package itself was packed well but I think the case was put in broken and open leaving parts to float around still. That is my guess based on how it arrived. Photos also added. I will update again once I learn more.Initial review: Received and the carrying case was not intact but pieces seem to be there for the set aside from the bar pictured called ‚Äúextended foam vacuum connecting rod‚Äù and the hand weights don‚Äôt go together as in the picture without that bar. The case was broken in multiple places and pieces falling out and it looked like someone had packed it up without securing the items inside. The black grips on the handles had pieces knocked off and there was black dust all over either from the broken handles or the broken case. And an odd smell. I washed my hands and the water was very dirty so I will be using them with gloves for sure. They seem decent other than the horrible packaging which caused some of the plastic to break on the case and the bar handles. I‚Äôll see how I do with my next workout when trying to use them.

Then these little saucer-shaped weights lock on each end with a straightforward, easy to manage (and super clever!) mechanism. Securely, too, so they can't come loose or fall off.

The weights have a rubber coating over the cast iron and shiny metal rivets in the 1 inch center hole. The openings in the plates make for easy handling. Excellent construction and design for sure! Very pleased overall with the Amazon delivery, the careful packaging and the quality of this product.ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:The shaft length of the barbell (middle portion of the barbell that falls between the sleeves) is 35 inches.

Rest assured, the Marcy product accomplishes that goal.The Dumbbells took around 1 week to arrive. The packaging is fairly poor but acceptable, and the plates come in a bit dirty with black/white dust covering them. Thankfully this dust can be wiped off fairly quickly with a little Clorox, so it's not the biggest concern given the price point you get them for.The handles and clips to hold the plates are in fairly good condition. The clips are very small, but after a bit of stress testing have proven themselves to be more than sturdy enough.You receive four 7.5 lb plates, and four 2.5 lb plates. In total, that can get you to 20 lbs per dumbbell if you so choose. While it is possible to frontload a single dumbbell up to 30 lbs, it is not advised per the product instructions to go any higher than 20 lbs per handle.The plates can rotate quite a bit during workouts (if they are not firmly tightened), which can get a little annoying during use. In addition, they are very bulky (as you can likely see in the pictures). Despite these shortcomings, they get the job done - and that's all there really is to it with weights.To conclude, these are good cheap Dumbbell options if you're looking for a deal and don't mind making a few concessions."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States March 25, 2020', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Thank you for saving my sanity.b', 'author': 'Amy', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""Cannot even begin to thank this seller.

These clips are there to help hold the weights in place but boy are they hard to put on. and most likely super hard to take off too. could not had put it on myself without my friend helping. i originally wanted to do reps with all the weights on then slowly reducing the weights but it seems like its not possible because the spring clips are so hard to put on. maybe its just me but other than the spring clips and dirty shipment, the weights are a great set for its price. overall its a great set but i minus a few points for the dirtyness and the horrible spring clips. without the spring clips the dumbells are nothing more than normal 20lbs set because i can't remove the weights and put on the clips without a 2nd person helping me. so it defeats the purpose of having a detachable dumbell bar + plates. I am thinking of buying a new pair of clips becuase these cheap clips are pretty useless. the weights are fine tho."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States November 26, 2009', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Nice dumbbell set', 'author': 'John Esposito', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""These dumbbells are a great value.

I was late to the workout game but started in May. I didn‚Äôt realize how hard it would be to find some dumbbells until I started looking. I found these at the beginning of June and ordered them. They arrived pretty quickly. The set is very pretty if that‚Äôs a thing. The case is garbage like others have mentioned. I got the delivery and I‚Äôm actually surprised I got the set in one piece because the box was falling apart and the weights were coming out.The pros:-since Dumbbells are hard to find and no longer reasonably priced I think this set gives you varied weight for your money.-They are a very good looking set of weights.-There is a ‚Äústorage case‚Äù so they don‚Äôt take up too much space.-My set was well machined so I didn‚Äôt get metal flakes or anything.The cons:-the ‚Äústorage case‚Äù will likely come broken. I wouldn‚Äôt use this to travel with, only to store them. The case is incredibly flimsy for holding 33 lbs of metal.-The combinations you can create are a little strange. Instead of 5lbs and 10lbs you‚Äôre probably getting combinations like 6lbs, 11lbs, 13lbs, or 16ish lbs. Not a big deal breaker for me though.-The quality is not awful but I wouldn‚Äôt throw these weights down after completing a set. I do tighten them and even so the plates will jiggle slightly by the end of my workout. So I‚Äôve been careful in how I place them down after a set.-They are not as comfortable as neoprene weights. Also because they are round they will roll on a hard surface. I don‚Äôt do a ton of lifting but if you‚Äôre doing a long workout the bar is not that comfortable and you may want to use gloves. For me I don‚Äôt use them enough to invest in gloves but something to consider.Overall I‚Äôm not disappointed with this purchase. I was able to find some neoprene weights right after I bought this set but I‚Äôm going to hold on to it because I don‚Äôt have weights larger than 12lbs.

I chose these because with 4 more 5 lb plates, they allow for small increments in the 2.75 to 26 lb. range. You can literally go up by just 1.25 lbs if you want to. Keep in mind the bars weigh 2.75 lbs and the 2 collars weigh 1.1 lbs., so they're almost 4 lbs without any plates. These are solidly made, and fit any plates made for a 1 inch bar.

The great thing about it is that you can also purchase additional weight plates as you need them...I've purchased several 5 lb and 10 lb plates to use with these to modify the amount of weights as need be depending on the exercise I am using it for.That being said, what other reviewers have said about the case being crap is true. I store mine with the plates on them, and additional plates elsewhere...I really don't think the quality of the case should be a factor in getting these or not, because the functionality is what matters most, and these are functional. And for me personally, if I have to travel, I don't find carrying this much weight to be a practical option, I'm much more likely to train with a body weight routine or bring a single kettlebell for those occasions.So I marked these down because like Sunny Health's barbell, the metal nut piece that keeps the weight plates on loosens up and has to be periodically tightened down, and it also makes them slightly more time consuming to change out weight plates on. I think that's something that can definitely be worked around, but it would make moves like the renegade row particularly not safe with these dumbbells. Actually, if you've got your heart set on doing that move a whole lot, I'd recommend hex dumbbells personally, but that may just be my take on it, because they have flat sides that won't roll on you, because regardless of what the nuts do on these things, they're very round, very smooth, and they're going to roll, even on carpet, which I think increases your risk of injury with that particular move. Otherwise, these are very functional for a full range of strength training moves."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 27, 2016', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Love them, but my case was broken as well', 'author': 'PookieThePirate', 'rating': 4, 'content': ""It seems the case that comes with it, is too flimsy and weak for the weights.The weights themselves, first there is this dusty smell but just wipe it off and it will be okay.

It's very easy to put the weights on as well, and the weights don't shake or move after you tighten them.I only got the 33lb because as a petite girl I didn't think I'd ever go as high as maybe 20 so I thought I should just get this set. However if you want more weights, such as a set that goes up to 40, there is another set on here that is 6 dollars more. I believe it's called the Cap Barbell 40 dumbbell set. I don't know about the quality though, but the bars look the same as well as the nut to tighten the weights. Then there's another Cap Barbell 40lb dumbbell set, but it's adjustable and it's 44 dollars, that's a bargain but again I don't know the quality. Also it seems possible to buy free weights that are different from this chrome set, and you can mix and match. As long as it can be screwed and tightened and not be wobbly.But I love these, and they aren't so bulky either. It's perfect for me personally. Doesn't take up a lot of room either.However the weight distribution in the case is also awful. I am knocking off a star because the case was broken AND too much weight on one side. I actually think this is why the case was broken. My case had a crack on the opposite side of where the weights were, go figure. It's not good for carrying around either. The weights will move inside the case too much and the case will break even more.By the way, it is 16.5 max PER dumbbell.

We have found that sometimes their chromed equipment has sharp edges or flakes, so we went with the 60in, Solid Bar, Black. My husband is lifting 300 pounds max - usually less - and I'm lifting 100 or under, so this bar seemed good.And it is just what we wanted. It's lighter than an official bar but heavier than a 1-inch standard bar, the black finish is attractive with no flaking or sharp edges at all. The knurling is comfortable and grippy. The sleeves don't stick, and while I don't think they have bearings or bushings, for this price, we weren't expecting any. The black finish is coming off of the sleeves in a couple small places, but for the price, we expected that. We're using it almost daily, with and without a small rack, and are completely satisfied.This is a budget-priced all-solid bar, so we didn't expect an Ohio Power Bar or something like that. We bought this bar as it will work for our needs and costs around 1/4 of the price of a value bar and about 1/8th of a price or less of a high end bar, but we don't need a high end bar. And to bring a solid bar in at this price range, there are going to be compromises, but we knew that going in.Overall if you don't want to spend too much money but don't want a hollow barbell, this is a solid option.

I didn\'t have a problem with them, even though they delivered my dumbbells 2 days after the delivery estimate(can\'t complain, free shipping). Fedex Smartpost sends to the closest USPS, then USPS takes an additional 2 days to deliver. It seems like most people hate Fedex Smartpost because they take longer than usual(""google fedex smartpost sucks"" to see what I\'m talking about). I ordered these on 2-9-13 and they arrived at my doorstep on 2-16-13, so one week exactly, average time for free shipping. The dumbbells came packaged professionally and my case came in perfect condition, which I was very pleased about.I also ordered 60 pound db set from Lion Roar Fitness on 2-8-13, and as of 2-16, they didn\'t even start shipping so I ended up cancelling that order. They charged $20 for shipping too... I will NEVER even consider buying from LRF again. Just wanted to warn you guys about that. $20 for shipping AND they lag it? No thank you.These Dumbbell sets are a great investment, and I know they will last a long time. First of all, there is no toxic chemical smell the negative reviewers mentioned. Not even the case it came with. They clearly have gotten better with quality control. I read ALL of the negative reviews and took a chance with these, and I am glad I did. My bars are all nicely polished, smooth, and the weights and collars fit accordingly. There are 4 pieces of rubber stoppers that help keep these weights in place, 2 in the middle of the bar and 2 that are connected to the collars, which does an excellent job. When you lift weights, you should never ""jerk"" through your workouts, but instead keep good form with nice controlled movements. That\'s how my workouts are, and the weights have not moved, rolled, clanked, at all. The only time the collars roll out, is when I twist them to change weights. I even put all the plates on one bar(30 lbs) and the weights/collars were still in place. People say these are not the best quality, but what more do you expect from a set of dumbbells? Good finish on the plates with a clean tough metal bar, which cannot rip as some rubber grip bars tend to rip after tightening the collars too much. Carefully put the plates on, or you could scratch/chip off the paint. If you don\'t like getting callouses on your hands, I recommend investing in gloves. I don\'t feel a thing with gloves on and can enjoy lifting weights without getting blisters. If you have Fat Gripz(check my review for Fat Gripz), you don\'t even need gloves. Those rubber suckers will cover it, and give you a much better workout.I will buy additional plates for these soon but before you guys do as well, try adding Fat Gripz to the bars with your normal workouts. It will give your workouts more of a challenge, and you will see some good results in your forearm strength. I wish I knew about them when I wrestled in high school..Long story short, don\'t listen to the negative reviews. Keep yourself in shape and buy these already!Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that the bars + collars does not equal 5 pounds(unless you are weighing both bars and 4 collars together). So you get about 17.5 pounds each dumbbell. The description states that they weigh 5 pounds but it\'s half. The case it comes with is about 5 or 6 pounds so that\'s where they kind of trick you. So if you do the math, 4 x 5lbs plate + 4 x 2.5 lbs plate + 2 x 2.5 collars & bar = 35 lbs + 5 lbs case = 40 lbs db set.. I\'m not going to knock off a star for that because I bought these knowing this information. We can always buy more plates, so no big deal.Thank you for reading my long review.

It's not perfect, but I'm not really sure that the imperfections matter for a product like this. So let's get the negatives out of the way first:- Yeah, they smell, as others have noted. It's nothing strange -- if you've ever been to a gym before, you already know this smell. They're metallic with additional chemical odors. For a basic sniff test, you won't notice much. But the smell does begin to accumulate after a few days in cramped quarters, so maybe they're not the best choice for a bedroom or tiny apartment. I suspect the smell will dissipate in time, but I don't know how long that will be.- The carrying case is cheap molded plastic, and there's a good chance yours will arrive with one or more corners dented. It's fine -- the cases aren't meant to be display items. They're meant to store the weights, and to give you a convenient way to lug them around when needed.- It's obvious that corners were cut in some regards. The rubber cushions on the bars are cheap, and could possibly fall off and get lost if you aren't attentive. Likewise, the rubber cushions within the screw-on collars can fall out. It's not a big deal if they do -- you just stick them back in. But these are obviously not advanced equipment. They were designed to be cheap and functional.That said, I don't think any of these cons really matter. Weights have one purpose in life -- to weigh something. Your muscles can't tell if you're holding twenty pounds of expensive metal or cheap metal. This particular set is very well priced, and they feel safe and sturdy. You don't have to worry about the collars wiggling loose, and they're adjustable down to 2.5 pound increments. I snagged two sets, giving me greater versatility and the ability to put more weight on a single bar if needed. For the price, this is a perfect way to get started with a cheap, space-saving home gym.Weights don't need to be pretty and fancy to work. They just need to give gravity something to act on. You can buy fancier equipment than this, but it's not clear why you'd really want to."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 3, 2014', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Honest review addressing common concerns...', 'author': 'Bleacherbum95', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'When originally considering this product I was very concerned with the number of negative reviews/comments that people were leaving about these dumbbells. After deciding to take the risk, I felt the need to write a review since I believe that the negative reviews are overblown and overly dramatic. I will hopefully address the main concerns that you as the prospective buyer are having while considering this product. If you don\'t care about the details I have a TLDR at the bottom =)1. Smell: These weights do not smells like daisies; no dumbbells do. However, the smell is NOT as bad as people are saying. I would highly recommend leaving these weights outside (and/or washing them) to let them air out and control the smell, but it is not immediately overpowering. When the package arrived I slowly opened the box waiting for a toxic stench to explode out, but it never came. It was not until I lifted a plate out of the box that I noticed the smell people mentioned (the chemical applied to prevent rust), and it was not very strong. I left mine in the garage to air out and noticed a slight change in the smell of the garage, but nothing extreme. I would certainly keep them out of the house to be safe, but for $40 a quick wash or airing out was worth it to me.2: Quality: If you are looking for professional dumbbells that are made of top quality materials then look elsewhere. But if you are looking for a solid set of starter weights, this is your product. I will say that the first time I removed a collar a small piece of metal broke off, but it did not affect the functionality of the piece. Also, I noticed someone mentioned that the collar lets the weights slide...this was incorrect in my experience. The collars seem to hold the weights snugly in place, so there should be no problems there. The quality is by no means great (unbeatable for the price though), but it is good enough that I trust it will last and serve its purpose.3. Case: I saw a few people talking about how the case broke easily. The case seems fairly sturdy if it is treated well. A case breaking or not will depend on your delivery man. The weights are packaged very well inside a few boxes (Amazon ships it out in an excessively large box), and in my experience there were no cracks. The sliders to keep the box closed seem pretty lame, but I\'m one of those people who isn\'t going to sweat it if the case breaks.I hope I covered the main concerns that most people were having. My honest review of this product is that this is unbeatable for the price. $40 with free shipping (mine came in 2 days) is great, and these are exactly what I was looking for. And NO I was not paid for this review and think Amazon should be ashamed of including paid reviews.TLDR: Does NOT smell that bad (easily fixed), decent quality, best bang for the buck for somebody looking for starter dumbbells.UPDATE 1/25/14: I now have two sets of these (it was cheaper than buying weight individually), and they are holding up great after over a year and a half of use. I\'ve noticed the collar shifts slightly when you get over 30lbs, but never enough that it\'s a problem. Be confident in purchasing these as starter weights.UPDATE 7/31/16: My original bars are still going strong. The collar shifting still happens on occasion, but not to the point where it interferes with my workout. I\'ve purchased additional plates for it and added them just fine - any 1"" plate should fit just as well as the originals. So these have held up strong for 4 years...zero complaints here. One thing I forgot in the original review - you may want some lifting gloves. The metals isn\'t forgiving on your hands, so if you don\'t want big calluses, invest in a cheap pair of gloves.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States June 2, 2012', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great Adjustible Weight Set', 'author': 'Lumbre', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'First of all, let\'s get the smell part clear. Yes, it smells. It smells similar to the stuff you find in the tire/automotive aisles at Target/WalMart/other stores. Yes, it can be a bit strong. Let it air for a day and put a dryer sheet in the case when you close it. Problem solved. If you\'re picky on having your home smell like candles or something, these are not for you. If you don\'t even notice the smell of a gym when you\'re in a gym (or aren\'t the quickest to pick up on smells), then you\'re fine. Also, I think it\'s the box that smells, not any of the paint.Pros:*It is easy to add/remove weights. Just unscrew the collars, remove/add weights, screw collars back in. You can do this while resting in less than a minute.*You can add your own weights. When you outgrow these, you can add your own weights (doesn\'t have to be the same brand). Any generic 1"" weight will do.*When I bought these, they were awesome for $40. Under $1/pound if you count the different combinations of weights you can do and that you can add more later.*Cheap compared to buying individually.Cons:*Slight bump in one of the corners of the case. No big deal. Contents inside are fine. Just an aesthetic issue.*Smell. As addressed above, it can be a bit overpowering, but just take the time to let them air out. Some people also do fine by rinsing them.*They\'re not neoprene.Notes & Thoughts:*A lot of people complain about the default California warning added to this set. Seriously, California is overprotective. Drinking dozens of gallons of water is known to cause death. If ingested, gasoline can destroy your organs. Too much sun can give you cancer. They have these warnings on a ton of things for sale in California. Something containing nickel, for example, automatically gets this warning. If it were more serious, more states or the entire country would place a warning or they would be getting sued for giving people cancer (it\'s not like lawyers are exactly shy).*The handles may be a bit too textured for some people, especially those with delicate hands or buying more weights. In that case, maybe you should buy weight-lifting gloves. For those who don\'t mind getting scuffed by sand or falling hands-first on pavement, you\'re fine. If anything, I shift my hands around on the bar which varies up my routine a bit.*People say it\'s a good starter set. I just started a serious workout routine and have had this for a month. I see myself having this for years.*A few have complained that the weights aren\'t exact. The bar doesn\'t seem like 5 pounds, but when I weight myself with one of my 20 lb. dumbbells, I see my weight increase by 19.8 or 20 (my scale goes in intervals of 0.2). It\'s close enough for me.

While most iron free-weights sell for around $2/pound (as of the fall of 2022), this set is much more affordable,The price for it does seem to vary wildly day by day. I paid $77 in October 2022 and see that a month later, it is selling for $65. But I‚Äôm not complaining since it‚Äôs a steal at either price.I bought 2 sets so I‚Äôd have a pair of dumbbells.The dumbbell bars and threaded, star-shaped end nuts are nicely made. The chrome coating seems thick and durable. And because the threaded nuts have black rubber washers on the side that makes contact with the weight plates, they tighten securely and stay firmly in place when in use. Other sets I‚Äôve used did not have the rubber washer and as a result, would loosen up while doing reps. That‚Äôs both annoying and dangerousThe rubber washers do tend to fall off when removing the nuts from the dumbbell, but that is easily rectified by putting a few drops of superglue in the groove in the nut into which the rubber washer sits.The weight plates themselves are a little less precisely made. For instance, I weighed my 5 lb plates on a postal scale and discovered they range anywhere from 4.75 lbs to 5.25 lbs. That‚Äôs not a big deal most of the time but you can definitely notice an imbalance if you inadvertently end up with 8 of the heavier 5 lb plates on one hand and 8 of the lighter plates on the other.To avoid that from happening, I used a silver Sharpie to mark the plate that are over 5 lbs and keep them in a separate pile so I can distribute the weight more evenly into the bars.Also, while the clear-coat on the plates seems heavy duty enough, you do need to check for rough edges. That goes for the dumbbell bars too. I had to file down a couple of spots to avoid getting metal splinters in my hands.Last but not least, the dumbbells I received have a diameter of 1.18 inches (or 30mm) and the weight plates have holes that size. This means any plates you may already have with 1 inch (25mm) holes will not fit onto these bars. Likewise, while the plates from this set will easily go onto a 1 inch bar, they can flop around a bit. In practice the latter is not a problem as long as you can tighten down the bar-end clamps. I use my 30mm plates on a 25mm curl bar without issue.In short, while there may be some compromises involved, at these prices, this dumbbell set is one of the best deals out there.Follow up note written on April 11, 2023:I‚Äôve been using my weight set several times a week for about 6 months now and all parts are holding up great!', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States November 28, 2022', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Really like these', 'author': 'Amazon Customer', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I needed a set to get started with.

In my case, while extremely heavy duty boxes were used, and well taped, one of the boxes was sliced open and minor damage to rubber ends of DBs in that box occurred. Looks like it was slid over something which cut it through.In any event, 2x5, 2x10, 2x15, 2x20, 2x25# DBs are included, making this an excellent ""base"" set. Handles are knurled and as expected in diameter and abrasiveness. No gloves required, but your mileage may vary.Is there a smell? seems to be the burning question. Of course they have a smell. They were just born of chemicals. They smell like what they are: rubber. So if you have ever had a new bike tire in your house, that is the smell, multiplied by a few pairs. It doesn\'t bother me in the slightest, and I was able to start using right away. I cannot relate at all to folks who seemed like they were going to swoon after opening the boxes.NOTE: I ""washed"" these with dish soap and water before using because they are covered in manufacturing residual dust etc. and will make your hands filthy otherwise. Mine did *not* have any kind of oily residues, as others have mentioned; again, just new tire smell, which for me is not obnoxious. But hey- some people think cilantro tastes terrible, so there is no accounting for taste.NOTE #2: Unlike the way Amazon\'s own brand and some other DBs I have purchased are wrapped, these were just loose in the box. No Styrofoam, no placement in a baggie, nada. Just in the box. So they are not going to be 100% brand new and flawless looking when you take them out. Get over it. They\'re dumbbells. They\'ll look like that in a couple months of workouts anyway. Also, because there is no protection, be judicious in opening the boxes. Just slice around the tape so you are not gouging a chunk out of your new best friends.I got these for basically a buck a pound, which is what weights were before Covid, and what they should be anyway, and held off on buying them until I hit the sale amount. Having said that, they would still be worth it for the $200 amount too, of course, just slightly less of a bargain.As has been mentioned by other reviewers, the A-frame is easy to put together, but will take your fingers off if you are not watching what you are doing when replacing the weights onto the rack, something which was also true at many gyms I have used and is a bug and not a feature of this style of rack.Definitely recommend, and would purchase again. Plan on augmenting with additional weights and eventually using a horizontal rack for all of them, but this was a steal-- and delivered on top of it.I am keeping the boxes. These are some of the heaviest duty boxes I have had sent to me.

Also, the ends would appear to be dipped to rubberize them, and some of the material splashed onto the chrome handles. Absolutely no big deal and can be cleaned off, but something to be aware of.

But if you switch them out between series of circuits, it won't take too long.More details below -- specifically about the exact weight of the configurations.---- original review ---A great way to add more weights (I was looking for 6lb, 7lb, 8lb, 10lb) without spending a fortune.I haven't worked out with these yet, but will update when I do. When I strength-train, I use circuits of 2-3 different exercises, 3 times each. These wouldn't be convenient to swap weights within the same circuit, but they seem OK to swap when I'm changing circuits, if needed.The set comes with 2 hand weights, each consisting of the empty hand weight, 2 large blocks, and 16 small blocks. You typically add the weight blocks in pairs -- one on each end so that it's balanced, but I tested it and you can use an odd number of small weights without causing any problems. And you can include or exclude the large blocks. - but always use these in pairs.The weights as listed in the instructions are not correct. I knew the docs weren't accurate when it said that you add 6 small blocks to go from 6.6 lbs to 8.8 lbs but then you add 4 more small blocks to go from 8.8 lbs to 11 lbs (also an increase of 2.2 lbs)Here's the real deal - yes, I'm pedantic, so I actually weighed all the parts. These are averages - each small block's weight is slightly different (by a tenth of an ounce here and there):The empty hand weight is 2.37 lbs2 large blocks weigh 2.45 lbs2 small blocks weigh 0.775-0.788 lbsHand weight plus 2 large: 4.82 (vs 4.4 lbs that they claim)Add 2 small: 5.60Add 2 more small: 6.38Add 2 more small: 7.16 (vs 6.6)Add 2 more small: 7.94Add 2 more small: 8.73Add 2 more small: 9.51 (vs 8.8)Add 2 more small: 10.29Add final 2 small: 11.07 (vs 11.0)I wish the documentation was more correct in this part, but as long as you know what the actual weight is, you can work accordingly."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States July 11, 2020', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars good to use', 'author': 'Sammi', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'it is a little bigger than i thought but still very good to use for my workout.

One served for a while as a chair/bench for my home office.Both benches are used for bench press, incline bench, spider curls, sit ups, weighted situps, seated military press, rows, flys, french press, etc, etc, etc - all the typical exercises one does with a bench. Thus far, both benches have served very well, without issues. I did not attempt to fully test the 600 lb weight capacity but I did get up around 500 lb and the bench felt stable to me.These are solid/strong benches, but there is some movement under load; this is to be expected with a lightweight folding bench. The little bit of movement is, to me, minor and easy to live with.The back-pad is about 11 inches wide. I\'d like a wider pad. But, because ""form ever follows function"", compromises must be made sometimes.Overall, these benches were a solid purchase. Sure, there are bigger, sturdier, and more stable benches out there but they cost more, are not available, and do not fold or travel easily. FlyBirds, on the other hand, were available, did not break the bank, do fold up and travel easily, and they do get the job done. They set up in a snap, and the price is on-point.ProsThey were available during pandemic, at the regular price - kudos to FlyBird Fitness for not price gouging.Delivered in less than a week - amazing considering some fitness companies take 2 weeks to ship a t shirt.Over performs on all expectations. Excellent ROI, great value.Impressive and seemingly accurate max weight rating,Moves, stores, and travels easily.Solid construction, quality materials.Padding is better than expected, very comfortable.Glossy finish on metal and vinyl covering cleans easy.Looks good.Good range of adjustments, heavy duty pins feel solid.Leg attachment is super helpful.Does decline - huge plus.ConsPlastic leg/feed end caps can/will come off sometimes.

(minor/typical/expected)Had to lubricate detent pins for seat/back adjustment. (minor/expected)Back does not adjust to 90"", there is a slight incline at max upright position. (being picky here)TakeawayGreat value, great return on initial investment. I wanted a bench that I can put in a closet, or the trunk of my car easily.

Here are my thoughts:pros:- assemble it yourself. it's super simple.- per spec it can hold my weight (~200lb) plus more weight than I'll ever press.- it folds up easily and stows out of the way.- it's light and easy to movecons:- the bench itself is a tad high off the ground. It's not a huge issue, but you do feel your feet are a little less planted especially when you are arched up to bench heavy.- the bar that you can lock your feet against seems like an after-thought. I almost never use it, but when I did need it (to get into a stable decline press position) I couldn't find a locking position to make it comfortable.- there are times when you need the bench to be rock solid stable (e.g., when doing bench dips, or when attempting a PB). This bench will rock and sway a bit. In other words you need to keep strict form always, otherwise you may feel the bench wobble under you, which is unsettling and possibly unsafe.- the seat is a bit too wide, and the back rest is slightly too narrow. Not a huge issue, but it does impact some routines: e.g., when doing seated dumbbell curls the dumbbells can graze the seat, and when rolling back with dumbbells or a barbell (e.g., to mount into a skull-crusher position) I'd feel more safe if the bench back support were wider.- the pre-drilled holes for the seatback positions are a bit odd. There's the flat and straight back positions. Those are fine. The decline positions are ok (though I can't lock my legs comfortably, but that's a separate issue). The other incline positions are just a tad too low or too high. I might drill a couple of extra holes exactly where I want them (should be easy enough to do).Despite the negatives I'd recommend this bench for the price and compactness.

As someone who loves to engage in various strength training exercises, this bench has become an essential part of my fitness arsenal.The first thing that impressed me about the FLYBIRD Weight Bench is its sturdy and durable construction. The heavy-duty steel frame ensures stability and provides excellent support during intense workouts. I feel safe and confident while performing various exercises, knowing that the bench can handle my weight without any wobbling or shaking.One of the standout features of this bench is its adjustability. With its fast folding and adjustable design, it's incredibly easy to switch between different positions for various exercises. I can quickly adjust the backrest and seat to target different muscle groups, making it ideal for a full-body workout. Whether I'm doing chest presses, incline or decline workouts, or shoulder exercises, the FLYBIRD Weight Bench caters to all my training needs.Another highlight of this bench is its comfortable padding. The high-density foam cushions provide ample support and comfort during extended workout sessions. The upholstery is not only soft and smooth but also easy to clean, which is a huge plus after sweaty workouts.Space-saving is a significant advantage of the FLYBIRD Weight Bench. Its innovative fast folding mechanism allows me to collapse the bench quickly and store it conveniently when not in use. This feature is especially valuable for those with limited space, as it can easily fit in a closet or under the bed.Furthermore, the FLYBIRD Weight Bench comes at a reasonable price point, making it an excellent investment for home gym enthusiasts.

They stand behind their product and go the extra mile to make sure the customer is satisfied. Even though I had problems with this bench, they made it right by sending me a replacement. When I found an issue with the replacement bench, they sent the appropriate parts to fix it along with a gift card for the inconvenience. 5/5 for customer service. If they're able to improve quality control, they would be a stellar company. See below for more detailed review of bench.5/29/21 Edit: Updated from 1 to 3 stars.A company rep reached out to me and offered a replacement. The rep seemed to really care about the customer experience and the replacement bench was shipped quickly. However, the new bench had 2 issues:1. It's missing one of the round stoppers on the leg of the bench that keeps the bench in place.2. The seat cushion is banged up / bent on the edges and seems a little unstable. The upper portion of the bench is also wobbly.I would give FlyBird 5 stars for their great customer support but 3 stars for the quality control of the bench.Bench Performance: I worked out with the bench once so far and it held up well. I'm 5'11, weigh 165 lbs, and used adjustable dumbbells (up to 50lbs each, so max of 100lbs). Although the bench did feel a bit wobbly at times, it did not feel unsafe at the current weight. However, I would not feel as comfortable using this bench if I was lifting above my body weight.Bench Ergonomics: The seat is very wide so might take a bit to get used to. The bench is taller than the normal benches you would find at the gym so might be harder to plant your feet on the ground when bench pressing, but it's still usable for me. The bench adjusts easily between flat/incline/upright positions.Bench footprint: This bench is light weight and assembles/disassembles very easily (literally takes 10 seconds) and can be stored away without taking up much space. This was one of the bench's main appeal and it did not disappoint in this aspect.Conclusion: If you want a light weight bench that is easily set up and put away, and do not plan on lifting very heavy, I think this bench is a good choice (as long as you receive a working product). I'll continue to workout using the bench for now and update my review if needed.____________Original Review:This item arrived with mold growing out of the seat.

I was not able to be too picky when I ordered it, as due to COVID-19 the selection was limited but I was finally able to get a bench for use in my home gym and was happy to be able to finally work out on something other than a rigged up setup.So first, what is good:Packaging was great. Setup took 5 minutes. Literally a couple of pins and screws. The assembly is pretty much fool-proof.The bench is light. Normally, you buy workout gear (and electronics) by the pound, so when something is light, it normally compromises somewhere but the design was very solid despite the weight. The light weight makes it really easy to fold and stow away. The whole thing is WAY easier to get out of the way than a non-folding bench. The folding mechanism is simple (1 pin) and is quite sturdy whether folded or open.The bench has very good angles. Lots of options, proper angles for flat, decline, incline, and seated work. The holding pin has a positive engagement and is easy to operate.The padding and back are a good thickness and width.Despite being light, the bench is VERY sturdy. Presses, flys, single arm work, raises‚Ä¶everything was stable and the bench worked great.The bench is high enough to do bench dips, for most people (more on height below).What is not so good:The seat flares to the front, which makes stepping over during incline work a little challenging. It takes a few workouts to get used to. Not a real issue.The bench is high. Meaning that when flat, it is pretty far off of the floor. I am 5‚Äô5‚Äù and my wife is 5‚Äô7‚Äù and while it is perfect for most stuff, it is too high for step-ups. Great for everything else but be aware that if you wanted to use is for step-us, you probably want to be taller than I am (which is not all that uncommon!)

Additionally, when using bench elevated I find the upper portion against my back is just a bit too short, so my head doesn\'t rest fully on the back unless I tuck my tailbone and scoot down a little. Again, I don\'t normally experience that at a commercial gym. Finally, the seat portion is wider in the very front, so when it\'s tilted up, I find it uncomfortably pushing my legs wider than they\'d naturally like to be.

I've been using it extensively for both heavy deadlifts and high-rep training sessions, and it shows no signs of wear and tear. The knurling is perfectly designed, offering just the right amount of grip without being overly abrasive on my hands.Another aspect I greatly appreciate is the barbell's versatility.

My husband is lifting 300 pounds max - usually less - and I'm lifting 100 or under, so this bar seemed good.And it is just what we wanted. It's lighter than an official bar but heavier than a 1-inch standard bar, the black finish is attractive with no flaking or sharp edges at all. The knurling is comfortable and grippy. The sleeves don't stick, and while I don't think they have bearings or bushings, for this price, we weren't expecting any. The black finish is coming off of the sleeves in a couple small places, but for the price, we expected that. We're using it almost daily, with and without a small rack, and are completely satisfied.This is a budget-priced all-solid bar, so we didn't expect an Ohio Power Bar or something like that.

I am not a fitness freak and just trying to get in shape more. This system is made of plastic, but it is a high quality plastic. It feels sturdy and solid!Everything is included in the pictures as is, but I wish they had included a second kettle base rod. The second handle for the kettle base is pretty much on its own since it doesn't have a place to go (unless you use it on a dumbbell or as a handle for pushups). Having a way to use two kettle bases at once would have been nice, or at least a way to store the last bit of weights so they are not loose.The yellow nuts are solid plastic and very sturdy. They screw on with no trouble and the threads on the entire system is of excellent quality. The weights on the dumbbells have not moved a cm since I got this a week ago. You will have an extra nut laying around due to the lack of a second kettle base. You could double up on one end of the dumbbells, or it will be used if you use less than 4 weights on the kettle base (needed to support the bottom).The barbell foam connector is nice and thick too. It is shaped in a rounded triangular pattern which allows for more stability. The only other thing I would improve upon is to provide both metric and imperial/standard systems on the weights. We can do the conversion easily online, but those of us here in the US cannot really fathom the difference between a kg compared to a lb. Although, I guess this will help us learn how to convert from kilograms to pounds.Overall, the entire system here is highly recommended and a quality set for the price. The plastic is really sturdy and feels like it will last a long time. I can only guess on whether there is a steel rod inside each bar (and if it is as thick as they say).

As many other in this stay-at-home time I decided to equip myself with the minimum stuff for exercising. I expected that dumbbells will be the easiest and the cheapest part - it\'s just a piece of metal after all. My na√Øve expectation was between 50 and 90 bucks. Turns out that I was so mistaken. Much more complex things (like benches) cost much less, while this ""just metal"" stuff is pretty expensive from all suppliers. And I needed many different weights for different exercises. An obvious solution was to choose one of variety adjustable dumbbells. I found an adjustable dumbbells totaling 105 pounds at about $100. Delivery wait time was long - about two month, but even after that I received nothing. Maybe I aimed too cheap. So I started investigating the topic more. And found (from customer reviews) that almost all providers of ""adjustable"" weights are pretty suspicious - wait time is too long, parts are missing, product is broken, adjustment is inconvenient, locking is unreliable, etc. I had to look at more expensive stuff. Found something at $600 (oh, that was so much higher than I expected in the beginning). And when I was almost ready to order it, I realized that all such ""adjustable"" dumbbells have too wide gripping bars - more than 17"" (a space is needed by design to allow weights combination). I realized that this will make most my exercises difficult or impossible to do (I need to lift and rotate them, keeping them close to each other, which would be impossible with such wide bars). So I switched my search to fixed-weight dumbbells which I originally skipped as too expensive considering that I needed several different weights. But at this time me price expectation has been lifted enough to make such solutions comparatively acceptable. To begin, I ordered just one pair for $123. It arrived in just few days in a good double-layered box. I tried them and immediately felt that this is exactly what I needed - easy to grab, easy to switch to other weights, comfortable and reliable for exercising. Am planning to order two or three more pairs (the cost will be still below the fancy adjustable one).', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 30, 2020', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Good item, missing hardware', 'author': 'C Speck', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'Box with weights arrived ripped wide open.

The amount of toxic chemicals I inhaled were probably more than I would in my entire life. The 25s were in plastic and then in a Saran Wrap type of bag that was ‚ÄúWET!‚Äù Yes, wet with chemicals that spewed out onto my brand new $2k flooring in my garage, that took me a LONG time to save up for and personally install!

When I ordered the set it was ""in stock"" and ""prime delivery"" for in a couple days. Well. A month passed and i received nothing. I contacted Amazon and they told me they had not shipped because the carrier is probably ""out of stock"" and will send once the items are available.FINALLY a package was delivered TWO MONTHS after I ordered the set. BUT IT WAS JUST THE SET OF 30 LB WEIGHTS! I looked it up and realized that they were sending THREE separate packages. One with the 30\'s, one with the rack and the 25\'s, and then one package with the rest of the weights. I understand they are probably too heavy to all ship all together- but at least send all the packages at once or let me know that is what is going to happen.SO, I waited more. And FINALLY the rack was delivered with the 25\'s. NEARLY ANOTHER MONTH LATER. (Now it has almost been 3 months since first ordering this set.) HOWEVER, IT WAS THE WRONG RACK. I had ordered the 2 tier rack and the carrier sent me the A framed rack. Which I wanted the 2 tier so i can eventually fit more weights AND it was more expensive. So, i had to return them. UPS wouldn\'t take them because Amazon only gave me one return slip- but the weights came in a separate box, so i needed 2 slips or was going to have to pay for a 50 pound package.I finally get amazon to send me another slip. Return the rack. They almost immediately sent me the new and RIGHT one. Which i appreciated. I don\'t understand why it took over 2 months to get the wrong one and then i received the right one right away?Keep in mind- i am almost 9 months pregnant and trying to return all this stuff twice. Carrying all this heavy equipment. Patience running thin.ALSO when the rack got here it had NO instructions. I had to just figure out how to assemble it. It took hours. There were metal ""hang nails"" in some of the holes where screws went, that kept screws from fitting through the holes. So. I had to get a LIGHTER AND HOLD IT TO THE METAL TO TRY AND MELT AND BEND BACK THE BLOCKAGE.And now. Here I am. Waiting to receive the rest of my weights (which are the lighter weights i will probably ACTUALLY be using.) And it has been 3 months since i initially bought this set. It sucks. I really wanted these. I wish the company would at least get in contact with me. I am about to pop out a baby and I do not just have 240 dollars to mess around with. Super frustrated by this whole process. Honestly not worth it or the price. I will keep what I have and what i am waiting for- it IS good quality and I have put SO much time into this now.

I really like the ease of use of the quick-adjust style like bow flex but was turned off by the cost, especially when I already have a bunch of weights. I looked into spinlocks but they pretty much all were 1 inch and I only have 2 inch plates. These fit the bill perfectly. I went with these specifically because they are 16‚Äù vs most of the others which are 20‚Äù wide. 16 is definitely the right choice, I can do any motion and they don‚Äôt feel too wide or hit each other. Your max weight will be limited to how many plates you can fit, but with my standard 5lb plates I can easily get 4 on each side with my thick collar locks, so about 50lb. If you switch to spring clips you could easily push that to 70 or 80lb using only 5s. I think 10s would be a little too large and get in the way of certain exercises. Speaking of spring clips, throw the included ones straight in the trash, they suck and the coating flaked off literally the first time I squeezed them.

I\'m only 5\'4"" with small hands, so I prefer a shorter dumbbell, and after considering all the 15"" and 16"" handles, I chose these AboveGenius Pair of 16"" Olympic Dumbbell Handles based on the price, the reviews and the length.They arrived in a box that was falling apart, but they were fine - the ends are wrapped in plastic and packed in foam, which is nice. Nothing had any smells or issues, although the manual was torn in 2 places. The handles looked good with no scratches or other damage at all. I weighed each one, and each weighed 7.1xx pounds, very close to the same weight.The collar spin is very good for \'bells at this price - nice, smooth spin. The end caps are snapped-in plastic, not exactly high-end, but then these are budget dumbbell handles, so that\'s fine. There\'s a little rattle in each one, but it\'s not bad. Both my 6\'7"" husband and me at 5\'4"" found them comfortable to use. If you like grooved collars, you\'ll like these, and the grooves probably work really well with the spring clamps. I\'m using my own clamps with the handles like I do with our other bars, but if you don\'t have clamps, the included ones will come in handy. I personally prefer smooth collars, but that\'s the only thing I didn\'t like about this pair of handles, and it\'s just personal preference.We\'re really happy with these. If you\'re a beginner they\'ll be great for getting started, and if you have been using spin-lock handles, these are better and much faster to change the plates on. The knurling is passive but it\'s good enough to keep your hands from slipping.

I‚Äôve had these I wanna say for like two or three months now they‚Äôre perfectly fine. I chose these because they‚Äôre affordable and they can go really heavy and I can gradually build up to get up there since I am trying to build my legs/glutes at home. I didn‚Äôt really have problems of like chipped paint, Also, I wear gloves when I handle them so I don‚Äôt get calluses. Also, the grip can be a little rough. Also, these can be adjusted really easy. If you get the 200 pound set which is about 100 pounds on each dumbbell therefore I can adjust it from 5 pounds which is just the handle all the way up to 100 pounds which is good so you don‚Äôt have to buy multiple it took a while to carry these upstairs only caring 10 pound plate one at a time since I‚Äôm not strong enough to carry more than 20 pounds at a time. These aren‚Äôt fancy or anything their regular weights they get the job done also, mine didn‚Äôt have any rough marks on the weights at all. Very smooth. It does take some time to change them out, but I don‚Äôt do super sets, so it‚Äôs not a problem for me. These are iron so they will basically forever I don‚Äôt recommend dropping them though I don‚Äôt recommend dropping any weights but like I said they‚Äôre iron so they‚Äôll last you a lifetime also from other sellers I got some additional plates so instead of going up to 100 mine can go up to 120 eventually I‚Äôll be able to lift that much just gotta keep practicing and working out. Not too much to stay about these weights. They‚Äôre exactly like the picture and they work perfectly fine. Also, when they do start to get old, you can clean them and buy iron spray paint, which will stop them from rusting if the paint starts to come off. that‚Äôs all', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 9, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Best out there', 'author': 'Marcelo', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I have a few adjustable dumbbells I‚Äôve bought over time on FB and CL.

As a fitness enthusiast who does a lot of strength training, I needed a bench that could provide me with the necessary support and functionality without breaking the bank. This bench more than exceeded my expectations, giving me excellent quality for its value.One of the things I appreciated most about the Finer Form Weight Bench was how easy it was to assemble. Everything arrived well-packaged, with clear instructions on how to put everything together. I was able to assemble it on my own without needing any additional help or tools, which is a great relief when dealing with complicated fitness equipment.The bench itself is incredibly durable and well-made. The steel frame is sturdy and can support up to 1000 lbs of weight, and the thick padding on the back and seat provides excellent support and comfort during my workouts. I also appreciate the versatile design of the bench, which allows me to adjust the angle to fit my needs, whether for incline, decline or flat bench press. This makes it perfect for a variety of different exercises, including dumbbell curls, shoulder presses and more.Aside from its functionality and high-quality, the bench also looks great. The sleek, all-black design fits perfectly in my home gym setup, and the bench is surprisingly compact so it doesn't take up too much space.

It's still available, and if you're just looking to do core work, it's a great bench. It doesn't fold, but it's easy to stand on its end.I purchased this updated FID version (flat/incline/decline) because it's truly what I wanted two years ago, but wasn't available. There are plenty of bench choices, but to my knowledge, Finer Form is the only one that incorporates an adjustable pad that can be used for preacher curls as well as Roman chair hyperextension. It can also be removed easily if you want more room while sitting.One thing I hate is creaky, squeaky furniture or equipment, and I wasn't sure what to expect for this price point when I purchased the first bench. I was surprised just how good the build quality was, and I can say that the new bench is equally sturdy, and the advertised weight limit has increased to 1000 pounds. I weigh 225 pounds, and there are zero creaks and no wobbles whatsoever. I don't know about the 1k limit, but I could see it easily handling over 400 lbs.Overall, this is a great addition to an at home workout room. The older model is great for core exercises, but not as good as it could be as a weight bench. Most other weight benches are great for lifting, but not well-suited to ab or back work. This newer bench from Finer Form is great for core exercise (sit-ups, hyperextensions), while adding support for dumbbell presses, fly, and other traditional bench exercises. Still not foldable, but still reasonably easy to stand on its end to clear floor space.The only negative I experienced were a couple errors in the assembly instructions that appear to be due to editing mistakes and poor proofreading. Although the instructions are a little confusing, the diagrams are clear and easy to understand. Just make sure to use the correct fasteners as shown in the diagrams, since some are slightly different in size and count.I am receiving no compensation for this review and paid the full Amazon retail price.

One mid bolt didnt want to go in all the way, may need a drill to get it in all the way- bit of tight fit it seems. Fast transition between workouts. Light weight. Back extensions are good enough, I was worried the bench was going to hit my face on the way down, which was not the case‚Ä¶ face comes close to it when bench is down enough to get good sets in, I would use bumbells on each hand for added weight vs plates on the chest. Decent padding.CONS: damaged during shipping- broken plastic cap, scratches, punctured. open parts package, missing parts. Too many moving parts during shipping. Bit wobbly during flys. I was just missing a washer which I bought at a local hardware store. One plastic cap was popped out and broken, will contact vendor to replace. Seems they add or remove parts to the parts package for this model needed or not needed for assembly. Even the manual says to contact them if there is anything missing. Suggest marking parts number on parts package- not sure why instructions use part number but parts package isn‚Äôt marked. Cheap thin pleather- if it ever rips I would upholster it with good quality thick leather. Other than that no complaints. Would suggest: extending the curl pads by an inch, I have a wide frame, arms on the edge during curls. An inch wider for the bench board/seat seems a bit narrow during sit ups.Overall decent bench for now, gets the job done, just don‚Äôt know how long the pleather will last.

It is not difficult to assemble, but kudos to anyone who says they put this together in 30 minutes. With two people, maybe. With one person alone, probably more like 60-90 minutes (still not bad). It comes with an Allen key and wrenches, but do yourself a favor and keep any ratchet tools you have handy.I have been using this now for regular workout for a couple weeks. It is a well-built bench, especially in this price range. I am a big person and in those two weeks I have yet to experience any lack of stability. The cushioning is comfortable I like the versatility of incline positions, foot pad positions, and preacher pad positions, and also like the handles by the preacher pad. I was originally looking at one of those collapsible benches, but I liked the idea of the preacher pad with bench incline, and some of the exercises this bench affords. This is NOT a portable bench that you can stowaway in the closet when you are done. It can be repositioned relatively easily as one side has wheels and the opposite side has a handle. But this is not one of those benches that collapses into something you can put under a bed. I like the chart that is included providing illustrations of how the bench can be utilized. The more of these exercises you can build into your workout the better bargain this bench becomes. A few things that I think would make this bench even better and probably not add too much to the cost: (1) include anchors for resistance bands - presently I use some extra velcro ankle straps with D-hooks around the legs of the bench. (2) the preacher pad is adjustable vertically, but not horizontally. If this could be adjustable width-wise it would be much better. (3) make the head rest adjustable. I am 5\'11"" and I have no problem, but it would be nice to have that extra versatility.All in all, I am happy with the purchase and recommend this bench.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 28, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent quality, solid, easy assembly', 'author': 'Amazon Customer', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""We bought this bench for our small workout room, and to have the leg pad/support for back extension type exercises.

It\'s sturdy, versatile and has some nice extras for the price - incline, flat, AND decline. It also comes with resistance bands - a set for the back and a set for the front that allow for surprising your muscles with alternative ways for time under tension. For instance, a seated front delt raise was quite different and challenging using the band placed on the back. The bench is sturdy and, when placed on my gym mat, doesn\'t move at all. There was some movement when used directly on the floor, however.Assembly is required on this bench and it\'s relatively easy. It took about a half hour to put together - it\'s helpful to have another set of hands to hold the bench. It has quality parts, instructions, and padding.If this sort of thing helps you decide, Men\'s Health rated Flybird as ""the perfect addition to your home gym collection"" and Forbes rated Flybird among its ""Best Home Workout Equipment for Strength Training.""If you\'ve been looking for a bench for a while, you can\'t go wrong with this one!', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 17, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Stylish and Sturdy Top Notch Bench üí™', 'author': 'Stuart D Briggs', 'rating': 4, 'content': ""‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Great looking workout bench! üí™‚ú® Assembly was a breeze, straightforward and simple.

They are perfect for my specific uses, which are shoulder exercises like external rotations that require light weights and small weight progressions (I use fractional plates or change plates) as well as wrist rotations and certain diagonal movements (because the bushings of my rotating-sleeve Rogue barbells make an annoying clicking noise when not held parallel to the ground). For other exercises with fairly heavy (for me) weights, I prefer sleeves that spin.The grip is 32.25 mm in diameter (satisfyingly wide) and has mild knurling that won\'t tear up your hands but should provide an adequate grip for most uses. The sleeves are ribbed and each has about 4"" of usable length (4.8"" total length). The endcaps are flat, black, and have an attractive blue logo. The finish of both the sleeves and grip is very good. The finish on the edges of the collars is a bit uneven but it isn\'t terribly noticeable unless you\'re looking for it. The welds look very solid. The dumbbells come in a box with the sleeves wrapped in bubble wrap to protect them, so there was no damage in transit.The dumbbells are a fairly light 4.6 lbs. each but still feel solid. The light weight is an advantage for beginners, for rehab/prehab, or for exercisers who want to exercise weaker muscles (e.g., doing external shoulder extensions). If you add fractional or change plates you can increase the weight of each dumbbell by as little as a half pound at a time to progress smoothly without injury. The light weight also permits you to use them as clubs with a fat 49 mm grip and the ribbing makes your grip more secure. I use them for all of these purposes.I think these dumbbells look really nice with their matte black coating. But I\'m not sure how durable it will be (it\'s not Cerakote) over time, especially on the sleeves if you use metal plates or bumper or urethane plates with steel inserts. (I can already see a few very small shiny spots where the coating was worn away on the grip but not on the sleeves.) My Olympic weights fit fine with a snug fit. The dumbbells come with spring collars that attach easily and securely. I\'m not sure whether they would scratch the sleeves over time so you might consider plastic collars like the ones from Clout if you want to avoid that, but two pairs of plastic collars are almost as much as the dumbbells.If you change plates frequently during exercise and don\'t enjoy doing so, you might want to consider adjustable dumbbells of the type where the weights sit on a stand and attach and detach quickly (like the popular PowerBlocks (not my favorite because of the plastic grip and clanging) or ones from Bowflex and the promising-looking ones from Rep Fitness, N√ºobell, Northdeer or IFAST.For dumbbells with rotating sleeves, I use the ones by Rogue. They\'re very nice, though expensive, and come in 10 lb. and 15 lbs. weights. I use American Barbell urethane change plates, which are durable and don\'t have a rubber smell and are attractively-priced for urethane, for weights between about 1 lb. and 10 lbs. (they come in kilos, not pounds) and the metal Micro Gainz fractional weight plates, which are small and colorful and fairly well made, for plates weighing up to 1 lb.

I do wish the handle portion was maybe just a touch wider. Using anything over a 25lb plate toward the middle is grip prohibitive due to my shorter arms, but luckily the sleeves are long enough to stack a few lower weight plates.

It was easy to put together, was very stable for chest supported rows, etc. However, as I continued using it, more and more things began to bother me about it.1) It has no wheels. A bench isn't necessary for every exercise so this thing gets moved around a lot. But moving it without wheels is a bit awkward as you have to lift the entire bench. Sometimes I'd misplace my grip and accidentally adjust the seat instead of picking it up.2) The gap between the seat and the rest of the bench can make things awkward. When I use this for bench press, I spend more time than I'd like positioning myself on the bench properly so I'm always in contact with it where I need to be.3) The width of the bench is not uniform and gets incredibly narrow. In fact, the most narrow part of the bench is 10 inches, which leads to me having to flip it around for bench press so I don't have a shoulder blade hanging off of the edge of the bench. I'm 6'3 so this was an issue for me, but others may see this as more of a pro than a con.4) Its sturdiness has occasionally come into question.

Unfortunately, unlike the other bench, which arrived preassemled, this bench needed to be put together - but it was only 6 bolts - and it came with easy-to-follow directions and some halfway decent tools. Assembly took about 10 minutes - and the hardest part (as another reviewer mentioned) was opening the blister pack containing the bolts, nuts, washers and tools. The other Flybird bench was foldable - this one is not - which I only realized when I sat down to write this post (something to keep in mind if that\'s important to you). All-in-all, I\'m very happy with this purchase. And the best part: I got it on a lightning deal - so paid just a few dollars more than the cost of the other bench.

I\'m 5\'11"" weighing a lean 240lbs, and it is very stable while working with an extra 230 lbs of weights (didn\'t try higher weight), also the headrest in the high position was tall enough to support my head in all backrest positions, which is important for me. I appreciate that it doesn\'t try to be a ""jack of all trades"" and keeps it simple. Just a bench with leg supports. Easy to fold up and stow.Headrest likely won\'t be tall enough in the upright position if you\'re over 6\'1"", but it\'s taller than most competition. I estimate it would be good for up to 6\'4""-ish in the flat position. The bands are very lightweight bands (might be good if that\'s what you\'re looking for). A little gimmicky but great idea. I found them useful for providing more resistance for sit-ups and core exercises. My wife loves them! Bought my own resistance bands and they work fairly well affixed to the oem points. Throw enough weight on the bench, and it works as a fairly good anchor point for them.4* instead of 5* because: The backrest adjuster on a sliding pin is excellent. The seat adjustment pin is just a standard pin. Could improve seat by adding a similar styled fast slider adjustment pin as the backrest. Headrest cannot be easily adjusted, you\'ll need to unscrew it, then screw onto lower position if you need to change it. Could improve by adding an easy adjustment pin for headrest instead of screw into place, but there\'s potential cons to that (headrest stability could suffer if not implemented correctly). Headrest screws were missing washers.Overall it is a great product. For your basic adjustable and stowable bench, this is the cream of the crop of all the ones I\'ve tried.

If you‚Äôre reading reviews, you know you can spend a lot more on a bench or even a bit less. My 5 stars is specifically for this price range, not against all benches that one could possibly buy. I am 6‚Äô3‚Äù, 200lb, and I am doing all kinds of strength training with barbells and dumbbells. For those activities, this is meeting almost all of my needs. The padding is good, and I don‚Äôt have any immediate concerns about the quality. Feels like it‚Äôs going to hold up well. The head portion can be extended (with bolts, not something you will do more than once probably), but I found it to be better for me at the lower position. The adjustments hit all the right angles for me, both with the back and the seat. The ankle pads are also in a good spot, and have good adjustments, although I don‚Äôt use them much. While the bench does have a decline option, I would not say it‚Äôs not the best. Doing decline crunches works, but I feel like it‚Äôs lacking proper support behind the knees. I have only seen very expensive benches do decline positions well, at least for someone as tall as me. Stability is pretty good for anything laying down or seated. No wobbling at all. Tricep dips are also stable. Using this for loaded hip thrusts is possible but not great. I have managed to use it by putting the bench against a squat rack to keep it from moving away from me. To be fair, you would need a pretty substantial bench to resolve this problem. Doing incline curls, with your chest against the bench, can be tricky if you‚Äôre tall. But I‚Äôve found putting my feet on the bench feet makes it more stable. I am not lifting crazy amounts of weight, but I would not be worried about this supporting about 500 lbs total. The angle adjustment is a spring loaded, pull motion pin, that also screws in to be sure it won‚Äôt move. It‚Äôs quite easy to adjust, while also not making me worry about it. It does fold up, and has a convenient handle at the seat to help carry it. I wish there was less of a gap between the seat and the back, but that is a feature you will need to pay more for.Overall this is a great bench for the price. Don‚Äôt go into this expecting the perfect bench because you aren‚Äôt paying the price for that. I‚Äôd say this gets you about 80-90% there though.

This bench meets and exceeds my expectations in all categories. Not only is it extremely adjustable, it will fit all body types and sizes. I was worried it would wobble but if you look at the feet, it is completely sturdy. You can do lawnmowers, crunches, and if that isn't enough... it came with a whole bunch of athletic bands that have seperate handles attached with steel carabiner clips. And a poster with a whole bunch of different workouts you can do.

This held the weight in place very well.I'm also using the bar with bands.

I didn\'t have a problem with them, even though they delivered my dumbbells 2 days after the delivery estimate(can\'t complain, free shipping). Fedex Smartpost sends to the closest USPS, then USPS takes an additional 2 days to deliver. It seems like most people hate Fedex Smartpost because they take longer than usual(""google fedex smartpost sucks"" to see what I\'m talking about). I ordered these on 2-9-13 and they arrived at my doorstep on 2-16-13, so one week exactly, average time for free shipping. The dumbbells came packaged professionally and my case came in perfect condition, which I was very pleased about.I also ordered 60 pound db set from Lion Roar Fitness on 2-8-13, and as of 2-16, they didn\'t even start shipping so I ended up cancelling that order. They charged $20 for shipping too... I will NEVER even consider buying from LRF again. Just wanted to warn you guys about that. $20 for shipping AND they lag it? No thank you.These Dumbbell sets are a great investment, and I know they will last a long time. First of all, there is no toxic chemical smell the negative reviewers mentioned. Not even the case it came with. They clearly have gotten better with quality control. I read ALL of the negative reviews and took a chance with these, and I am glad I did. My bars are all nicely polished, smooth, and the weights and collars fit accordingly. There are 4 pieces of rubber stoppers that help keep these weights in place, 2 in the middle of the bar and 2 that are connected to the collars, which does an excellent job. When you lift weights, you should never ""jerk"" through your workouts, but instead keep good form with nice controlled movements. That\'s how my workouts are, and the weights have not moved, rolled, clanked, at all. The only time the collars roll out, is when I twist them to change weights. I even put all the plates on one bar(30 lbs) and the weights/collars were still in place. People say these are not the best quality, but what more do you expect from a set of dumbbells? Good finish on the plates with a clean tough metal bar, which cannot rip as some rubber grip bars tend to rip after tightening the collars too much. Carefully put the plates on, or you could scratch/chip off the paint. If you don\'t like getting callouses on your hands, I recommend investing in gloves. I don\'t feel a thing with gloves on and can enjoy lifting weights without getting blisters. If you have Fat Gripz(check my review for Fat Gripz), you don\'t even need gloves. Those rubber suckers will cover it, and give you a much better workout.I will buy additional plates for these soon but before you guys do as well, try adding Fat Gripz to the bars with your normal workouts. It will give your workouts more of a challenge, and you will see some good results in your forearm strength. I wish I knew about them when I wrestled in high school..Long story short, don\'t listen to the negative reviews. Keep yourself in shape and buy these already!Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that the bars + collars does not equal 5 pounds(unless you are weighing both bars and 4 collars together). So you get about 17.5 pounds each dumbbell. The description states that they weigh 5 pounds but it\'s half. The case it comes with is about 5 or 6 pounds so that\'s where they kind of trick you. So if you do the math, 4 x 5lbs plate + 4 x 2.5 lbs plate + 2 x 2.5 collars & bar = 35 lbs + 5 lbs case = 40 lbs db set.. I\'m not going to knock off a star for that because I bought these knowing this information. We can always buy more plates, so no big deal.Thank you for reading my long review.

It's not perfect, but I'm not really sure that the imperfections matter for a product like this. So let's get the negatives out of the way first:- Yeah, they smell, as others have noted. It's nothing strange -- if you've ever been to a gym before, you already know this smell. They're metallic with additional chemical odors. For a basic sniff test, you won't notice much. But the smell does begin to accumulate after a few days in cramped quarters, so maybe they're not the best choice for a bedroom or tiny apartment. I suspect the smell will dissipate in time, but I don't know how long that will be.- The carrying case is cheap molded plastic, and there's a good chance yours will arrive with one or more corners dented. It's fine -- the cases aren't meant to be display items. They're meant to store the weights, and to give you a convenient way to lug them around when needed.- It's obvious that corners were cut in some regards. The rubber cushions on the bars are cheap, and could possibly fall off and get lost if you aren't attentive. Likewise, the rubber cushions within the screw-on collars can fall out. It's not a big deal if they do -- you just stick them back in. But these are obviously not advanced equipment. They were designed to be cheap and functional.That said, I don't think any of these cons really matter. Weights have one purpose in life -- to weigh something. Your muscles can't tell if you're holding twenty pounds of expensive metal or cheap metal. This particular set is very well priced, and they feel safe and sturdy. You don't have to worry about the collars wiggling loose, and they're adjustable down to 2.5 pound increments. I snagged two sets, giving me greater versatility and the ability to put more weight on a single bar if needed. For the price, this is a perfect way to get started with a cheap, space-saving home gym.Weights don't need to be pretty and fancy to work. They just need to give gravity something to act on. You can buy fancier equipment than this, but it's not clear why you'd really want to."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 3, 2014', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Honest review addressing common concerns...', 'author': 'Bleacherbum95', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'When originally considering this product I was very concerned with the number of negative reviews/comments that people were leaving about these dumbbells. After deciding to take the risk, I felt the need to write a review since I believe that the negative reviews are overblown and overly dramatic. I will hopefully address the main concerns that you as the prospective buyer are having while considering this product. If you don\'t care about the details I have a TLDR at the bottom =)1. Smell: These weights do not smells like daisies; no dumbbells do. However, the smell is NOT as bad as people are saying. I would highly recommend leaving these weights outside (and/or washing them) to let them air out and control the smell, but it is not immediately overpowering. When the package arrived I slowly opened the box waiting for a toxic stench to explode out, but it never came. It was not until I lifted a plate out of the box that I noticed the smell people mentioned (the chemical applied to prevent rust), and it was not very strong. I left mine in the garage to air out and noticed a slight change in the smell of the garage, but nothing extreme. I would certainly keep them out of the house to be safe, but for $40 a quick wash or airing out was worth it to me.2: Quality: If you are looking for professional dumbbells that are made of top quality materials then look elsewhere. But if you are looking for a solid set of starter weights, this is your product. I will say that the first time I removed a collar a small piece of metal broke off, but it did not affect the functionality of the piece. Also, I noticed someone mentioned that the collar lets the weights slide...this was incorrect in my experience. The collars seem to hold the weights snugly in place, so there should be no problems there. The quality is by no means great (unbeatable for the price though), but it is good enough that I trust it will last and serve its purpose.3. Case: I saw a few people talking about how the case broke easily. The case seems fairly sturdy if it is treated well. A case breaking or not will depend on your delivery man. The weights are packaged very well inside a few boxes (Amazon ships it out in an excessively large box), and in my experience there were no cracks. The sliders to keep the box closed seem pretty lame, but I\'m one of those people who isn\'t going to sweat it if the case breaks.I hope I covered the main concerns that most people were having. My honest review of this product is that this is unbeatable for the price. $40 with free shipping (mine came in 2 days) is great, and these are exactly what I was looking for. And NO I was not paid for this review and think Amazon should be ashamed of including paid reviews.TLDR: Does NOT smell that bad (easily fixed), decent quality, best bang for the buck for somebody looking for starter dumbbells.UPDATE 1/25/14: I now have two sets of these (it was cheaper than buying weight individually), and they are holding up great after over a year and a half of use. I\'ve noticed the collar shifts slightly when you get over 30lbs, but never enough that it\'s a problem. Be confident in purchasing these as starter weights.UPDATE 7/31/16: My original bars are still going strong. The collar shifting still happens on occasion, but not to the point where it interferes with my workout. I\'ve purchased additional plates for it and added them just fine - any 1"" plate should fit just as well as the originals. So these have held up strong for 4 years...zero complaints here. One thing I forgot in the original review - you may want some lifting gloves. The metals isn\'t forgiving on your hands, so if you don\'t want big calluses, invest in a cheap pair of gloves.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States June 2, 2012', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great Adjustible Weight Set', 'author': 'Lumbre', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'First of all, let\'s get the smell part clear.

Let it air for a day and put a dryer sheet in the case when you close it. Problem solved. If you\'re picky on having your home smell like candles or something, these are not for you. If you don\'t even notice the smell of a gym when you\'re in a gym (or aren\'t the quickest to pick up on smells), then you\'re fine. Also, I think it\'s the box that smells, not any of the paint.Pros:*It is easy to add/remove weights. Just unscrew the collars, remove/add weights, screw collars back in. You can do this while resting in less than a minute.*You can add your own weights. When you outgrow these, you can add your own weights (doesn\'t have to be the same brand). Any generic 1"" weight will do.*When I bought these, they were awesome for $40. Under $1/pound if you count the different combinations of weights you can do and that you can add more later.*Cheap compared to buying individually.Cons:*Slight bump in one of the corners of the case. No big deal. Contents inside are fine. Just an aesthetic issue.*Smell. As addressed above, it can be a bit overpowering, but just take the time to let them air out. Some people also do fine by rinsing them.*They\'re not neoprene.Notes & Thoughts:*A lot of people complain about the default California warning added to this set. Seriously, California is overprotective. Drinking dozens of gallons of water is known to cause death. If ingested, gasoline can destroy your organs. Too much sun can give you cancer. They have these warnings on a ton of things for sale in California. Something containing nickel, for example, automatically gets this warning. If it were more serious, more states or the entire country would place a warning or they would be getting sued for giving people cancer (it\'s not like lawyers are exactly shy).*The handles may be a bit too textured for some people, especially those with delicate hands or buying more weights. In that case, maybe you should buy weight-lifting gloves. For those who don\'t mind getting scuffed by sand or falling hands-first on pavement, you\'re fine. If anything, I shift my hands around on the bar which varies up my routine a bit.*People say it\'s a good starter set. I just started a serious workout routine and have had this for a month. I see myself having this for years.*A few have complained that the weights aren\'t exact. The bar doesn\'t seem like 5 pounds, but when I weight myself with one of my 20 lb. dumbbells, I see my weight increase by 19.8 or 20 (my scale goes in intervals of 0.2). It\'s close enough for me. I don\'t need it to be that exact.*Mine didn\'t seem to have any loose seal rings or collars. They seem good for the price. They may shift a small amount after a 30 minute workout to where you can hear a slight clunk.

While most iron free-weights sell for around $2/pound (as of the fall of 2022), this set is much more affordable,The price for it does seem to vary wildly day by day. I paid $77 in October 2022 and see that a month later, it is selling for $65. But I‚Äôm not complaining since it‚Äôs a steal at either price.I bought 2 sets so I‚Äôd have a pair of dumbbells.The dumbbell bars and threaded, star-shaped end nuts are nicely made. The chrome coating seems thick and durable. And because the threaded nuts have black rubber washers on the side that makes contact with the weight plates, they tighten securely and stay firmly in place when in use. Other sets I‚Äôve used did not have the rubber washer and as a result, would loosen up while doing reps. That‚Äôs both annoying and dangerousThe rubber washers do tend to fall off when removing the nuts from the dumbbell, but that is easily rectified by putting a few drops of superglue in the groove in the nut into which the rubber washer sits.The weight plates themselves are a little less precisely made. For instance, I weighed my 5 lb plates on a postal scale and discovered they range anywhere from 4.75 lbs to 5.25 lbs. That‚Äôs not a big deal most of the time but you can definitely notice an imbalance if you inadvertently end up with 8 of the heavier 5 lb plates on one hand and 8 of the lighter plates on the other.To avoid that from happening, I used a silver Sharpie to mark the plate that are over 5 lbs and keep them in a separate pile so I can distribute the weight more evenly into the bars.Also, while the clear-coat on the plates seems heavy duty enough, you do need to check for rough edges. That goes for the dumbbell bars too. I had to file down a couple of spots to avoid getting metal splinters in my hands.Last but not least, the dumbbells I received have a diameter of 1.18 inches (or 30mm) and the weight plates have holes that size. This means any plates you may already have with 1 inch (25mm) holes will not fit onto these bars. Likewise, while the plates from this set will easily go onto a 1 inch bar, they can flop around a bit. In practice the latter is not a problem as long as you can tighten down the bar-end clamps. I use my 30mm plates on a 25mm curl bar without issue.In short, while there may be some compromises involved, at these prices, this dumbbell set is one of the best deals out there.Follow up note written on April 11, 2023:I‚Äôve been using my weight set several times a week for about 6 months now and all parts are holding up great!', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States November 28, 2022', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Really like these', 'author': 'Amazon Customer', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I needed a set to get started with.

In my case, while extremely heavy duty boxes were used, and well taped, one of the boxes was sliced open and minor damage to rubber ends of DBs in that box occurred. Looks like it was slid over something which cut it through.In any event, 2x5, 2x10, 2x15, 2x20, 2x25# DBs are included, making this an excellent ""base"" set. Handles are knurled and as expected in diameter and abrasiveness. No gloves required, but your mileage may vary.Is there a smell? seems to be the burning question. Of course they have a smell. They were just born of chemicals. They smell like what they are: rubber. So if you have ever had a new bike tire in your house, that is the smell, multiplied by a few pairs. It doesn\'t bother me in the slightest, and I was able to start using right away. I cannot relate at all to folks who seemed like they were going to swoon after opening the boxes.NOTE: I ""washed"" these with dish soap and water before using because they are covered in manufacturing residual dust etc. and will make your hands filthy otherwise. Mine did *not* have any kind of oily residues, as others have mentioned; again, just new tire smell, which for me is not obnoxious. But hey- some people think cilantro tastes terrible, so there is no accounting for taste.NOTE #2: Unlike the way Amazon\'s own brand and some other DBs I have purchased are wrapped, these were just loose in the box. No Styrofoam, no placement in a baggie, nada. Just in the box. So they are not going to be 100% brand new and flawless looking when you take them out. Get over it. They\'re dumbbells. They\'ll look like that in a couple months of workouts anyway. Also, because there is no protection, be judicious in opening the boxes. Just slice around the tape so you are not gouging a chunk out of your new best friends.I got these for basically a buck a pound, which is what weights were before Covid, and what they should be anyway, and held off on buying them until I hit the sale amount. Having said that, they would still be worth it for the $200 amount too, of course, just slightly less of a bargain.As has been mentioned by other reviewers, the A-frame is easy to put together, but will take your fingers off if you are not watching what you are doing when replacing the weights onto the rack, something which was also true at many gyms I have used and is a bug and not a feature of this style of rack.Definitely recommend, and would purchase again. Plan on augmenting with additional weights and eventually using a horizontal rack for all of them, but this was a steal-- and delivered on top of it.I am keeping the boxes. These are some of the heaviest duty boxes I have had sent to me.

Also, the ends would appear to be dipped to rubberize them, and some of the material splashed onto the chrome handles. Absolutely no big deal and can be cleaned off, but something to be aware of.

I ordered one, and it arrived in unusable condition. The threading on the pipe to connect the two bars was not aligned and I could not get the two parts of the bar to join together. The threading was also bad on the bolts that hold the dumbbells in place.I initiated a return and hoping I could still use the device I had Amazon send me new one, which they did promptly. Unfortunately, even properly functioning, this device still disappoints.This one appealed to me because it has a longer handle than the one I purchased prior, and I read in the comments it would work with my FitRX adjustable dumbbells. These have short handles which are not wide enough for the other dumbbell converter I purchased on Amazon. They do in fact fit, but the difficulty with getting them on and off basically defeats the purpose of an adjustable dumbbell.The clamp wraps around the handle of the dumbbell, and to begin, it just scarcely fits. You don't want these things loose in there, obviously, but to secure the clamp you have to apply pressure on it while you screw on the nut. This is difficult to do, because there is not much to grab onto beyond the area where the nut is threaded down onto the bolt, and you have to turn the nut many times to get a secure fit.In my first use, this put tension on the handle of the dumbbells, which caused one of them to click back five pounds. As I took the bar up, and the dumbbells came out of their racks, the weights caught and I had to go through some fuss just to get it out of the rack. Then I discovered that I had uneven weight on each side, and realized what had happened with the tension clicking the weight handle back 5lbs.And of course, to then change the weight intentionally, one must take the clamp off, which involves unscrewing the nut from the belt, opening the clamp, adjusting the weight, clamping back on, and screwing down again, all while trying to make sure the tightening does not put tension on the handle and click it back 5lbs again."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 30, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Fits Nuobell dumbells', 'author': 'Byron A.

Thus I am back to these leg pokers I hated and they work perfectly with the hooks and I can load more then I will probably ever need using my Olympic sized weights.

For many individuals, the kit includes the necessary components to perform all 19 exercises depicted in the included manual. However, 14 of the exercises (74%) require use if the included door anchor to which one end of the exercise band is is then secured. I do not have an interior door positioned in a location where I can exercise safely, so consequently I cannot perform 74% of the suggested exercises. Although the kit does includes two ankle bands secured with Velcro, one of which could be secured around a stationary object like a post or column, etc. to which the other end of the band could be attached, the manufacturer specifically cautions against using the ankle bands citing that it is dangerous. It is for this reason only that I cannot give this product a 5 star rating. I contacted the manufacturer inquiring whether they could provide a separate strap with two D-rings that could then safely secure the end of the band to the included caribiner and suggested that if not, perhaps they would consider including one in a future product upgrade, which would greatly increase their product's versatility and even allow their product to be used outdoors using any applicable stationary object to secure the band. The manufacturer got back to me very quickly, demonstrated their understanding, but also indicated that they did not have such a strap, but said that they would pass my recommendations on to their product design team and very courteously and thoughtfully thanked me for my input. If I could give this company higher than a five star rating for their professionalism and customer service I would readily do so. As mentioned, for some individuals the lack of a separate strap to secure the band is not a problem, but for me it limited using the product's full range of capabilities. I subsequently purchased a very affordable, double D-ring band as noted that now permits me to perform the full compliment of exercises virtually anywhere I can wrap the strap around that will ensure a secure point to attach the exercise band."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States November 18, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars I needed this', 'author': 'Chey', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I was hospitalized Feb- Jul 2023 and couldn't walk that whole time.

They're a pretty, cheerful shade of blue, and while the handles are textured so you don't lose your grip, they're also smooth and simple to wipe down. And the set up here is just amazingly clever. The handles weigh 2 lbs. by themselves. (It's written right on the handle). Then these little saucer-shaped weights lock on each end with a straightforward, easy to manage (and super clever!) mechanism. Securely, too, so they can't come loose or fall off. And each little saucer shaped weight adds half a pound. So if you put one saucer on each end, plus the handle, you're lifting three pounds. Two saucers give you four, and all three saucers gives you five pounds. So you can ramp up.I guess if you're already a hard-core weight lifter, these may not be for you . . . but if all that stuff is intimidating, but you'd like to try lifting weights at home, give these a try.

They go well next to my sand Bala beam so I can keep some of my workout equipment cohesive in the color scheme that I like.

The handles and bars all feel very high quality and I was impressed with how secure the longer bar felt once assembled. I've not owned a set like this before and the magnetic pin system seems pretty easy and quick to swap between the three different modes. Adjusting the weight by twisting also works well. When I extended the base to make a stand for the longer bar, that's the only time I felt like it wasn't quite as secure as I'd like...the connections feel a little bit loose, but if you're not moving it around, it doesn't cause a problem. Also, the stand only works with one configuration at a time, so if it's extended for the longer bar there's not really a place to set the dumbbell down so kind of wish there was a center area for the dumbbell and the longer bar at the same time.My only other complaint would be that the system for switching the weights causes the weight of the bar to be offset a bit if you're doing curls, etc...since some of the total weight is shifted to the top due to the mechanisms...if that makes sense.

The actual system that we use was out of stock and way delayed. This is a good substitute with some limitations for workouts at home, at a fraction of the cost of the actual LM set.I really appreciate that the plates are solid material with a TPU outer ring. Most of these other sets are sand-filled plastic shells and that's a no-go for me. They're very sturdy and durable - reinforced in places that need them and the numbers stand out. The threading of the bars is also very thick, smooth, and easy to do-up or break apart. There is a slight bit of play when the barbell is put together with the connecting rod but this is a tradeoff for easier assembly/ disassembly, and while it may loosen up a little bit, there is enough threading to keep it from coming apart. The bar is about 1.1-1.5 inches in diameter depending on where you grab it so it's got a good heft and feel to it.The Specs:Dumbell bars > 2lbs (I think 2.2lbs.)Bar connector < 2lbs (about 1.8 lbs.) - finished bar ~ 7lbs. (these weights are from when I first weighed them)4x. 2 Kg (4.4 lbs)4x 1.25 Kg (2.75 lbs)4x 1 Kg (2.2 lbs)4 + 1 plastic screw locking nut. (I appreciate the extra one)I generally use my bar for squats like the first set-up. This is about 36.8 lbs and I think this isn't recommended because the locking screws can't be done in all the way (The correct way is probably in the second photo). I don't recommend the connected dumbbells for added weight during squats as it doesn't rest on the meaty part of the upper back.Limitation: It maxes out the available weight for this bar with what you have, but the end connectors still screw them together securely. For Bodypump, it's a little on the light side, and because the end stops are threaded, it just takes a bit longer to change weight - but you're buying this system and it's really only light for squats at my level.This bar is great for the repeated rows, deadlifts, high-pulls, clean and press, chest press, shoulder press, bicep curls... Endless possibilitiesLimitation: If you have a bigger wingspan, the barbell is a bit narrow (28 in./ 71 cm. across plate-to-plate) to do wide rows and presses.For BP, the plates also feel good in the hand if you want to hold them together for presses during the lunge track or those days where your shoulders/lats are gone during the flyes and rotators in the shoulder track. I like how they're not entirely round, they have flat sections.You can also break them apart as dumbells for unilateral work, as I do when I'm not doing BP. This is an alternative to the wide rows/presses with the barbell if you want to put more isolation on the left/right sides of your body.*I think in this case, you cannot exceed 3 plates on either side of the dumbbell bar in the case of making one super heavy dumbbell.*Other constructive criticisms:- If the connector can be slightly longer, adding maybe 10 - 12 inches to the span of the barbell- The weight set is a little light and I'd like some expandability. Maybe sell additional heavier weight plates on the side for us to upgrade our existing sets.Again, I am very happy with this bar set-up.

I can add a total of 14 extra weights to one bar for a total 19.5lb at maximum. Four of the weights are end pieces do not allow more weight to be added onto them. Balancing all the weights between the two bars is 12.6 lbs. each.The outer material is a rigid plastic. To add a weight, line a new plate flush to the side and slide down from the top with white buttons visible from the top. The plates slide into a V-shaped groove and clicks into place. The lock is a plastic tab that sticks out about 2mm and fits into a notch on the added plate. Pressing the top button makes the tab recede into the plate and lets you remove the adjoining plate.Keep in mind that these thin plastic tabs secure these weights when upside down, so it's wise to always keep the buttons facing upward.

One served for a while as a chair/bench for my home office.Both benches are used for bench press, incline bench, spider curls, sit ups, weighted situps, seated military press, rows, flys, french press, etc, etc, etc - all the typical exercises one does with a bench. Thus far, both benches have served very well, without issues. I did not attempt to fully test the 600 lb weight capacity but I did get up around 500 lb and the bench felt stable to me.These are solid/strong benches, but there is some movement under load; this is to be expected with a lightweight folding bench. The little bit of movement is, to me, minor and easy to live with.The back-pad is about 11 inches wide. I\'d like a wider pad. But, because ""form ever follows function"", compromises must be made sometimes.Overall, these benches were a solid purchase. Sure, there are bigger, sturdier, and more stable benches out there but they cost more, are not available, and do not fold or travel easily. FlyBirds, on the other hand, were available, did not break the bank, do fold up and travel easily, and they do get the job done. They set up in a snap, and the price is on-point.ProsThey were available during pandemic, at the regular price - kudos to FlyBird Fitness for not price gouging.Delivered in less than a week - amazing considering some fitness companies take 2 weeks to ship a t shirt.Over performs on all expectations. Excellent ROI, great value.Impressive and seemingly accurate max weight rating,Moves, stores, and travels easily.Solid construction, quality materials.Padding is better than expected, very comfortable.Glossy finish on metal and vinyl covering cleans easy.Looks good.Good range of adjustments, heavy duty pins feel solid.Leg attachment is super helpful.Does decline - huge plus.ConsPlastic leg/feed end caps can/will come off sometimes.

Here are my thoughts:pros:- assemble it yourself. it's super simple.- per spec it can hold my weight (~200lb) plus more weight than I'll ever press.- it folds up easily and stows out of the way.- it's light and easy to movecons:- the bench itself is a tad high off the ground. It's not a huge issue, but you do feel your feet are a little less planted especially when you are arched up to bench heavy.- the bar that you can lock your feet against seems like an after-thought. I almost never use it, but when I did need it (to get into a stable decline press position) I couldn't find a locking position to make it comfortable.- there are times when you need the bench to be rock solid stable (e.g., when doing bench dips, or when attempting a PB). This bench will rock and sway a bit. In other words you need to keep strict form always, otherwise you may feel the bench wobble under you, which is unsettling and possibly unsafe.- the seat is a bit too wide, and the back rest is slightly too narrow. Not a huge issue, but it does impact some routines: e.g., when doing seated dumbbell curls the dumbbells can graze the seat, and when rolling back with dumbbells or a barbell (e.g., to mount into a skull-crusher position) I'd feel more safe if the bench back support were wider.- the pre-drilled holes for the seatback positions are a bit odd. There's the flat and straight back positions. Those are fine. The decline positions are ok (though I can't lock my legs comfortably, but that's a separate issue). The other incline positions are just a tad too low or too high. I might drill a couple of extra holes exactly where I want them (should be easy enough to do).Despite the negatives I'd recommend this bench for the price and compactness. If you're careful it should serve you well."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 26, 2022', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Ultimate Full Body Workout Companion!', 'author': 'Real Deal', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""The FLYBIRD Weight Bench has completely transformed my home workout routine, and I couldn't be happier with this purchase.

They stand behind their product and go the extra mile to make sure the customer is satisfied. Even though I had problems with this bench, they made it right by sending me a replacement. When I found an issue with the replacement bench, they sent the appropriate parts to fix it along with a gift card for the inconvenience. 5/5 for customer service. If they're able to improve quality control, they would be a stellar company. See below for more detailed review of bench.5/29/21 Edit: Updated from 1 to 3 stars.A company rep reached out to me and offered a replacement. The rep seemed to really care about the customer experience and the replacement bench was shipped quickly. However, the new bench had 2 issues:1. It's missing one of the round stoppers on the leg of the bench that keeps the bench in place.2. The seat cushion is banged up / bent on the edges and seems a little unstable. The upper portion of the bench is also wobbly.I would give FlyBird 5 stars for their great customer support but 3 stars for the quality control of the bench.Bench Performance: I worked out with the bench once so far and it held up well. I'm 5'11, weigh 165 lbs, and used adjustable dumbbells (up to 50lbs each, so max of 100lbs). Although the bench did feel a bit wobbly at times, it did not feel unsafe at the current weight. However, I would not feel as comfortable using this bench if I was lifting above my body weight.Bench Ergonomics: The seat is very wide so might take a bit to get used to. The bench is taller than the normal benches you would find at the gym so might be harder to plant your feet on the ground when bench pressing, but it's still usable for me. The bench adjusts easily between flat/incline/upright positions.Bench footprint: This bench is light weight and assembles/disassembles very easily (literally takes 10 seconds) and can be stored away without taking up much space. This was one of the bench's main appeal and it did not disappoint in this aspect.Conclusion: If you want a light weight bench that is easily set up and put away, and do not plan on lifting very heavy, I think this bench is a good choice (as long as you receive a working product). I'll continue to workout using the bench for now and update my review if needed.____________Original Review:This item arrived with mold growing out of the seat. Not sure if it's inside the seat foam, but there is mold on several surfaces of the bench.

I was not able to be too picky when I ordered it, as due to COVID-19 the selection was limited but I was finally able to get a bench for use in my home gym and was happy to be able to finally work out on something other than a rigged up setup.So first, what is good:Packaging was great. Setup took 5 minutes. Literally a couple of pins and screws. The assembly is pretty much fool-proof.The bench is light. Normally, you buy workout gear (and electronics) by the pound, so when something is light, it normally compromises somewhere but the design was very solid despite the weight. The light weight makes it really easy to fold and stow away. The whole thing is WAY easier to get out of the way than a non-folding bench. The folding mechanism is simple (1 pin) and is quite sturdy whether folded or open.The bench has very good angles. Lots of options, proper angles for flat, decline, incline, and seated work. The holding pin has a positive engagement and is easy to operate.The padding and back are a good thickness and width.Despite being light, the bench is VERY sturdy. Presses, flys, single arm work, raises‚Ä¶everything was stable and the bench worked great.The bench is high enough to do bench dips, for most people (more on height below).What is not so good:The seat flares to the front, which makes stepping over during incline work a little challenging. It takes a few workouts to get used to. Not a real issue.The bench is high. Meaning that when flat, it is pretty far off of the floor. I am 5‚Äô5‚Äù and my wife is 5‚Äô7‚Äù and while it is perfect for most stuff, it is too high for step-ups. Great for everything else but be aware that if you wanted to use is for step-us, you probably want to be taller than I am (which is not all that uncommon!) The thing is, it HAS to be high to allow it to fold properly, so this is a design feature, not a design flaw.

Unfortunately, when used as a dumbbell, it fall short.You have to screw-in the two dumbbell handles into each side of the padded, middle barbell section. The problem there is that the middle section should\'ve been made longer & the barbell handles at least 2 inches shorter.Trying to do dumbbell or hammer curls, or flys is next-to-impossible, without risking have the end of the handle hitting you in your face. If you try to execute triceps extensions, the dumbbell handle might skewer you in the back. Simply stated, the dumbbell handles are just too long, being about 21 1/2 inches in length, compared to the roughly 14 1/2 inches of my steel dumbbell bar.The padding on the barbell section feels pretty good. It\'s not the greatest quality, but I understand that because you get what you pay for & I can live with this unit as a barbell. It\'s good as a beginner set, I\'ll let my grandson start off with it because the weights are adjustable enough for him to be able to handle. But at age 13, I won\'t let him anywhere near those 2 spears which pose as ""dumbell handles"".I bought it because I liked the idea of it being compact, as I have limited space. I also liked the idea of a Kettlebell, which brings up another design problem with this set. Unless you completely load up the kettlebell handle with weights, you\'ll find that after attaching the kettlebell handle, your knuckles will be scraping against the locking clamps.I\'m just getting back into weights & wanted to ease my way back & I thought that this would be good set, as I\'m not trying to get into heavy lifting at this point & time.

The poor design will simply frustrate the average person & limit the movements that they can execute when using the dumbbell.It\'s a very unwieldy set & that\'s sad because as crazy as it sounds, I still like this set. What I\'ll probably end up doing is using it for the barbell, then using my metal dumbbell handle to do dumbbell work. Which kinda defeats the purpose of buying this set.

Used for farmer carry, overhead carry, turkish get-up, squats, etc. Some dumbells either don\'t have enough grip or are too harsh on the hands for more advanced exercises like these, but this dumbbell can be used like a dumbbell and like a kettlebell.Pros: Good protective coating, soft feeling and comfortable in hands, larger handle.Cons: Possibly larger handle (don\'t know what the other weights are like).Dumbbells aren\'t rocket science, but I\'ve used some bad ones...these do the job and do it well.

My research has led me to dumbbells being fairly valued between $1.00 to $1.50 / lb. These came in roughly on the high end of fair value so I was more than happy to buy. I bought the 12 lb pair and two-20 lb singles.These are being used at least once a week and they are great. I did not find any sort of damage, unpleasant smells, defects, etc. Just open it up, quick inspection, and lock and load. Thank you!*** Handles - Note, some reviewers felt Day1 dumbbell handles are obscenely large.

Gondek', 'rating': 3, 'content': 'Measured exactly the 15 pounds that I ordered, with good grippiness. No problems with the neoprene taking the finish off furniture, like a cheaper pair I have. The hex shape could be more defined, but they don\'t roll on flat surfaces.That said, I wish I\'d realized just how large ""1.81 inches"" diameter can be for the grip - I didn\'t even realize that grips varied this much, since all my other sets have such smaller grips. This grip is MUCH larger than any other dumbbell in my collection, including the 20- and 25-pound sets, and the swell at the center makes it even worse. That makes these dumbbells very, very uncomfortable for my average-sized (gloves: ladies\' medium) hands. Very expensive to return, so I suggest you be sure you like this huge grip size before you purchase.Edit to respond to the manufacturer\'s comment on my review: The research about wrist strain is great, but the problem is the grip is very unsure with this huge diameter. My hands barely go around the monster grip, and I\'m relying on finger strength more than forearms to maintain my grip as a result. I\'m constantly worried I\'m going to drop the weights and smash my face when I\'m doing chest flies or similar over-the-face/head exercises. I have no problems with my 25- and 20-pound weights (which have traditional grips), so I\'ll definitely be looking for a 15-pound pair from another brand, with a traditional grip.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 23, 2018', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Good for kids or starting out.', 'author': 'vernicek', 'rating': 4, 'content': ""Ordered these for my 10 yr son they are fine for him the only complaint I have is one weight is noticeable thicker that the other so it feels awkward to hold .

When I computed value by dividing capacity by the cost per battery of the cheapest package size, they took a respectable third place, and they have the advantage of being a trusted name compared to the value leader. In the images I have attached a graph and a table summarizing my test results for the 7 types I've tested, but if you'd like to know more about how I test ... on to the in-dept test & review.I've been on a bit of a quest to test all of the top-selling aaa batteries on Amazon in a repeatable, precise way. This means the same equipment, same environmental conditions, and same slots in the equipment will be used for each test. For each test, I fully discharge 3 batteries in my Opus BT-C2000 battery analyzer at rates of 100 ma, 200 ma, and 400 ma (discharge rate affects usable capacity). I have also performed this exact same test (same equipment, same conditions) on the ACDelco, Duracell Procell, Duracell Coppertop, Energizer MAX, Maxell, and Rayovac. I have linked the other brands I've reviewed at the end of this review if you'd like to take a look at the other results for comparison purposes. For the Amazon Basics batteries, the capacity at each discharge rate was:Disch Rt | Capacity | Runtime | Sample use case100 mA | 997 mAh | 10 hrs | Low-power LED flashlight200 mA | 914 mAh | 4.5 hrs | Electronic toy / medium LED flashlight400 mA | 623 mAh | 1.5 hrs | Motorized toy / bright LED flashlightNote that these (and all other Alkalines) would achieve somewhat higher capacity (maybe 1200 mAh) in a low discharge application like a mouse, keyboard, remote control, etc because alkaline batteries have internal resistance that reduces usable capacity at high discharge rates.The capacity of these batteries is among the best I've tested -- take a look at the attached data table for comparative data. For the cost (~$0.31/ea in a 36 pack right now), these are a decent but beatable value -- the power supplied per dollar spent is very good, but eclipsed by other currently available options.Comparison:These batteries do well capacity-wise, but value-wise are blown away by the currently cheapest energy/dollar battery that I've tested, the ACDelco aaa's. Their capacity results were:Disch Rt | Capacity | Runtime100 mA | 1005 mAh | 10 hrs200 mA | 864 mAh | 4.3 hrs400 mA | 670 mAh | 1.7 hrsAs you can see, the Amazon batteries were very comperable ... but, at the current time the AmazonBasics batteries are $0.31/ea (36 pack), while the ACDelco batteries are about $0.21/ea (48 pack) -- so the ACDelco are significantly cheaper per mAh. I did not test shelf life, so it's possible that these may hold up better sitting in a drawer. Although both the Amazon batteries and the ACDelco batteries are certainly made on contract by a third party, I do think that I trust Amazon a bit more to provide consistent batteries than ACDelco ... although I haven't had any trouble with my ACDelco batteries so far. It's also worth noting that the Amazon batteries come in clearly superior packaging - while the ACDelco batteries come in a horrible gigantic plastic blister pack, the Amazon batteries come in a closable cardboard box. If you don't go through a lot of batteries & organization of your battery drawer is important to you, that could push them into the all-around winner category despite the ~50% price premium.Finally, because another review specifically mentions the Rayovac AA's as being 'good' in some usage scenarios, I thought I'd share my findings for the Rayovac AAA's. In short, they're garbage - the Amazon batteries are better in EVERY case. It's possible that the Rayovac AA's are much better than the AAA's, but I think it's more likely that the version of the Rayovacs tested by the website that he got his results from is different than the most popular Rayovac on Amazon (I source all of my batteries from Amazon). I ran the Rayovac test several times because I couldn't believe how poorly they did ... here are some typical Rayovac results:Disch Rt | Capacity | Runtime100 mA | 908 mAh | 9 hrs200 mA | 590 mAh | 2.9 hrs400 mA | 443 mAh | 1.1 hrsMy other battery tests/reviews:I have posted reviews for Duracell Coppertop, Duracell Procell and ACDelco aaa alkaline batteries with capacity data gathered using the exact same method and equipment. To find those reviews for comparison purposes, go to the product pages linked below and search for 'mah' under 'all reviews' (or just browse to them on my profile).

My orginal review is below:I can't FULLY attest to the longevity of these, but I cannot care less if they only last two weeks. I bought 48 of these (two packs of 24) for like barely $14!! That's absolutely insane! The main reason I bought these was because the brand was listed as a small business, and I am a small business owner myself. I was so excited to get them, that I paid extra (through Amazon's prime service) to have them overnighted. They came packed so well and neatly! Just as others have posted. I immediately put them in LED tapers I bought for the season. I have been running them from about 5pm-2am every night and they remain as bright as Duracell that you'd buy a measly 6 pack for, for $10. The price of batteries in stores these days is absolutely astronomical. I had to do multiple takes to make sure I was reading these prices right.This is the best purchase I've made in literally years. Thank you so much!!

Because of the reduced shelf life, I reduced my review by one star.

Obviously, each battery I received was above the nominal average for alkaline batteries.Of course, I cannot predict for how long the batteries will hold their charges, nor for how long each battery will last once I put them into service. However, I expect they will store long enough, and last long enough once I put them into service, so that I will not be disappointed with them.If I do experience significant issues with the batteries, I will update this review.For the price ($22.91), for 24 D cell batteries, I believe these batteries to be a very good deal.

I have always been a DuraCell customer and decided to purchase in quantity, for all of the devices I have at home. And I do a lot of traveling which requires the use of AAA batteries in mobile devices (outside of typical smartphones, etc).I stumbled upon a review for ACDelco batteries, which was done by a consumer who had battery discharge test equipment to measure the actual load and capacity of multiple brands of batteries, ignoring all of the advertising hype, which motivates people to buy one over another, This reviewer. tested all of the major brands, taking brand new batteries of each and putting them through a regimen of uses to see how quickly they drained, under various loads. He had a battery discharge measuring device (Opus), which draws specific levels of power, from light to heavy loads, and yields the results in a measurable way. I love it when someone posts a review which peels back the skin of an onion, to see what is really going on ""under the hood"". In case you can\'t find his review, I am quoting it in parentheses below, after my comments.At first, I was a bit bit surprised, being a long time ""victim"" of DuraCell and EverReady advertising, having never considered ACDelco, but then it made a lot of sense that this General Motors company and brand has always equipped their new cars with their own ACDelco batteries. It certainly makes sense that they might have a deeper brain trust of technology to deliver a superior ""small electronics"" battery. At any rate, I am extremely pleased that I stumbled upon his review, which means a lot more to me than all of the advertising hype, which does nothing to deliver any actual credible and unbiased information.The reviewer goes by the profile name of just ""C"" and is an Amazon Top 1000 Reviewer. His review is at the top of reviews for the ACDelco battery page on Amazon with the following linkhttps://www.amazon.com/ACDelco-Batteries-Alkaline-Battery-Performance/dp/B00FF8KQJC/ref=pd_sim_121_4?_encoding=UTF8&refRID=WYRQGK7Z5SQ285XRJ6SS&th=1Below is his review without the images which he attached, showing his test equipment and charts of his results for 6 Brands tested.C (TOP 1000 REVIEWER)5.0 out of 5 stars6 Brands Tested: Capacity test results + a clear winnerOctober 31, 2015I couldn\'t find a review stating the tested capacity of the leading AAA batteries on Amazon, so I took it upon myself to find out. For each of the 6 types I\'ve tested (ACDelco, AmazonBasics, Duracell Coppertop, Duracell Procell, Energizer, and Rayovac), I discharged 3 batteries in my Opus BT-C2000 battery analyzer at rates of 100 ma, 200 ma, and 400 ma (discharge rate affects usable capacity). These ACDelco batteries were among the top in capacity, and stomped EVERY other battery in terms of value, with AmazonBasics as a runner-up.The capacity at each discharge rate was:Disch Rt | Capacity | Runtime | Sample use case100 mA | 1005 mAh | 10.1 hrs | Low-power LED flashlight200 mA | 864 mAh | 4.3 hrs | Electronic toy / medium LED flashlight400 mA | 670 mAh | 1.7 hrs | Motorized toy / bright LED flashlightI ran the ACDelco batteries first, and my original review I stated that ""Though not top-notch, these results are perfectly respectable"". Well, since then I\'ve run 5 more brands, and these are pretty close to top-notch. The only other brand that managed to beat them in ANY category was AmazonBasics, but really AmazonBasics and ACDelco were at the top of the stack and the differences were probably within the margin of error. Put simply: these batteries pack a lot of punch, and they\'re cheap. For the cost (~$10 as of this writing), these are an excellent value -- the power supplied per dollar spent is nearly unbeatable for a non-rechargeable aaa battery, AND the capacity is very nearly the best I\'ve tested.I have not tested shelf life or leak resistance for any of the batteries in my roundup, so it\'s possible that some of the other batteries may do better in that regard. The one thing I *have* learned is that a battery\'s marketing has nothing to do with its actual performance for power capacity ... assuming that the same is true for storage, you\'ll have to wait until somebody runs a thorough leak and storage test to know which brand is best.I have posted reviews for Duracell Procell, Duracell Coppertop, Energizer, and AmazonBasics aaa alkaline batteries with capacity data gathered using the exact same method and equipment. I have attached a graph and table summarizing the results in the images.

Batteries always lose voltage as they are used, and some devices need more volts than others.

These batteries lasted an exceptionally long time, providing reliable power to my gadgets for over a year without any noticeable decline in performance. I was pleased with the cost-effectiveness and longevity of these batteries, and they seemed like a great value for the price.However, my positive experience took a turn for the worse when I discovered that one of the batteries had leaked after approximately a year of use. The leak caused damage to the electronic device it was powering, and I was quite disappointed by this unexpected and unfortunate outcome.While I cannot deny that the Rayovac D batteries performed admirably for an extended period, their eventual leakage has left me feeling hesitant to fully recommend them. The fact that such a long-lasting product ended up causing damage due to leaking is a significant drawback, and it has certainly impacted my overall satisfaction with these batteries.In conclusion, while the long-lasting performance of the Rayovac D batteries initially impressed me, the subsequent leakage issue has tarnished my opinion of the product. I would caution potential buyers to carefully monitor the batteries over time to ensure that they do not encounter a similar problem.

Looking closer at the listing, obviously these are not rechargeable (the rechargeable PowerOwl batteries are also black, but have silver text instead of gold). The difference wasn\'t evident when I made a purchase off an Amazon recommendation... ultimately that\'s on the customer to read the description so I can\'t fault PowerOwl for that. The ones I did use (prior to erroneously using them in a charger) seemed to work well-enough and the company did agree to offer a refund so for those reasons I\'m going to re-rate these positively and remove my video. Given that the ""dangerous"" part of this was a confusion with packaging, I\'m still going to take one star off. Given that the packaging is really simple and attractive, but having two batteries with such similar packaging, some rechargeable and some not, does introduce some risk, especially if a customer were to purchase both types of batteries and use them regularly.--> Original Review [Video removed]Beware and watch my video! I popped PowerOwl batteries on the PowerOwl charger after they had been in my office supply cabinet. Once placed on the charger, I recieved the indication these units were charging. When I checked on them again after an hour, they were giving me an error with multiple cells leaking some caustic liquid. It caused mild chemical burns on my fingers after a VERY short period of time. The batteries appear to have a bulge on the negative end. I\'m not sure if I have a bad charger or a bad batch of batteries, but I feel like I did everything as PowerOwl advertised yet recieved something broken. I don\'t like to be hyperbolic, but something here is flat-out dangerous.

Again, so far, good news.But here's where things aren't so good. While you can easily spend $0.67/each for top brand AA batteries here on Amazon or you can do these at $0.50 each, there are more than a few others offering AAs that aren't top tier at $0.50 each, but aren't mystery brands, either. That price is 2/3rds the big labels, but some of the other second tier names offer this lower price, too, while I'd call this brand an unknown.Is it a good price? Is it a potential money saver?

When I saw the Ever-Brite alkaline 64 pack for the same price as a 24 pack of name brand batteries I pounced. As my picture indicates, the batteries came in nice storage case.

I thought that meant it was a variety pack containing some of each AG13, L1154d, and LR44, but they\'re all LR44, and apparently that size can also replace several others. The battery from the pictured clock had been removed long ago, and I had no idea what size was in there, but one of these little buttons worked. It\'s only been a few days since I put it in. Hopefully I won\'t know how long it lasts for quite some time. Another once of these powered up a different desk clock that had also been missing a battery for years.I don\'t have any fancy equipment to tell you what their charge was upon arrival, but the package (pictured) states best by 12/2028, so just under 4 years from my order. I originally thought that was minimal, but upon reviewing the description, they only promise 3-year shelf life, so I guess they over-delivered.I loved that I was able to get these out of the packaging with ease. I\'ve had other button cell batteries so tightly sealed in plastic that they practically had to be melted out of their case, but these have perforated slots in the cardboard back making them easy to remove.I do think it\'s a bit sketchy that they use the Duracell colors considering these are obviously not Duracells, but I guess if Duracell doesn\'t have the color scheme trademarked, it\'s Juninxiu\'s prerogative.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 27, 2024', 'is_verified': False}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great for Bore Sights', 'author': 'SuperTed', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I have a 12 gauge laser bore sight that takes LR44 batteries and I picked these up to use as backups as you can never have too many in my opinion.Not much to say here other than you get a pack of 10.

The bore sight I have takes THREE of these, so I loaded it up with three and it worked (see pics). That's all I can ask for.Anyone who uses bore sights knows that the laser draws a lot of energy so typically these don't last long if you have it constantly on during the zeroing of your red dot sight, hence why you need a goodly amount of backups. Also, anyone who has read my previous reviews on batteries knows that I typically use generic/no-name brands over name brand anyways and I almost never have longevity issues with them.

The USB-rechargeable lithium-ion batteries that recently came on the market are great, but they’re expensive. I’m not about to buy enough of them to replace ALL of the AA batteries that I need for household use. So every few years I pick up a big pack of Energizers at Sam’s or Wal-Mart, and they last me for quite a while.The price of a 48-pack of AAs at Sam’s as I write this is $0.49 per battery; it’s a little more at Wal-Mart and maybe a little more still at other places. But nowhere did I see a price as high as $0.98 per battery, which, currently at $3.90 for a four-pack, is what these Coast AA Industrial Performance Alkaline Batteries cost.There’s nothing special about these batteries, and certainly nothing to justify them costing twice as much as other brands. Their specifications are the same, their construction is the same, their chemistry is the same and their five-year storage life is unimpressive; I’ve bought AA batteries dated 10 years out, so a five-year life gets a big yawn from me.I don’t often rate Vine items with one star, and if my rating were only based on performance, I’d give these batteries three stars; as a commodified product, they’re as good as, but no better or worse than, other brands. They work as intended, and there’s nothing else to say about that. But at almost a buck apiece? That’s obscene, in my opinion.

While I haven’t been using them that long yet, I haven’t had an issue with unexpected short life span so far. I tested all the batteries, and they had a full charge. I do this now after experiencing some dead on arrival batteries in the past (not this brand). There’s nothing worse than pulling out a “new” battery, only to find it’s already a goner.Alkaline batteries usually have a shelf life of 5-10 years, so this battery is on the minimal end for shelf life. The batteries I received were already into a year of their life span. I’ve seen that even with major name brands. It just depends on how long the product has been in the warehouse, etc. How much of an issue all that may be will depend on how frequently you use batteries. I’d be more concerned about it if it was a larger quantity of batteries. At $3.90, the price is somewhat competitive. I’ve seen 4 count alkaline batteries for more and for less. It’s probably the upper end of what I’d want to pay for a 5 year battery.

However, the batteries received appear to be a year old. So (20%) of that life is gone. Although I do not know the manufacture date, there appears to be an expire date marked on each battery, which reads 12-2026. Now I received these batteries at the end of December 2022, so I do not consider that “fresh” when comparing with a big-name competitor, which sent me batteries, also made in China, like these, during November 2022, and they had an August 2022 manufacturing date. So, I am going to use that as a barometer, i.e., three (3) months from date of manufacture to receipt, from China, is reasonable. Reason being, when buying batteries, we want fresh batteries, and these are not as fresh! Those competing batteries also had a five (5) year shelf life.ChargeI was curious about these batteries’ charge, so I went over to my battery tester, to see how these scored. Coast’s batteries measured at the maximum charge level, which was expected. I want to get what I paid for. Through various tests, I do expect these batteries will last as any other competitors.ValueHowever, the next issue boils down to value. These are premium in cost, as in 100% to near 300% greater. That’s a big number; and these are not giving me any indication they will have a similar lifespan, so, I do not have the first impression that I received significant value. Plus, these are a brand that we really are not familiar with.SizeWe also checked size, because there is nothing worse than an oversized battery that will not fit the slot of an electronic device, such as a remote control, or a toy, because the battery is too big. We used a competitor to compare. Coast’s 1.5-volt AA battery measured comparable to that of the competitor.Bottom-lineConsidering the totality, would I select these again? Hmmm, I think I would experiment with the competition’s batteries first (which is a reason I selected these, to experiment with, against others that I have).I hope my thoughts informative.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 1, 2023', 'is_verified': False}]"

They punch through the cardboard side of the package reasonably easily.I don't understand why they're labeled for AG10 and LR1130 at the same time. My understanding is that AG10 cells are 2 mm thinner; maybe you can get by on some devices where there's a spring contact that can compress, but certainly not all uses. Also note that some devices prefer silver-oxide batteries, which last longer. Just because the size and voltage are correct doesn't mean you're getting a good deal if you're swapping more frequently.

You can never have enough flashlights in the house!It comes in a cute little carboard box with two extra corrugated squares on top and bottom for extra padding. This box is much easier to open than the more typical sealed plastic packs and also more environment friendly.The 10 year storage life of course depends on the definition of the term. (10 years seems standard for Alkaline C batteries of the typical name brands.). All alkaline batteries lose a few percent capacity per year and the storage life depends on what remaining capacity is acceptable. My guess is that after 10 years they will have about 70% left and will not go bad overnight. I assume that after 10 years in storage, the battery is still usable, but there are so many factors such as storage temperature that will modify the curve. I recommend to start using them way before the expiration.Fortunately, the ""expiration date"" (for lack of a better term) is printed on the bottom of each battery rim, see picture.

More later.)The second one required 409 mAh and its initial charging current was the same, 410 mA.Thirty minutes after charging, the batteries read 9.29 and 9.26 volts.As a test, a resistive load was connected to one battery: The initial voltage was 9.15 volts and the current was 350 mA.

The current delivered in those final intervals is unknown but can be considered to be less than the readings from the previous interval. During the second test, the battery voltage was monitored closely in the final interval in order to capture complete data.)The batteries were charged after testing. To bring them to a full charge required 1023 mAh and 1040 mAh, respectively.However, these are 9-volt batteries which are being charged from a 5-volt source. Which, probably, means there are at least two lithium cells inside the battery. If so, the charging current is divided between them by the battery management system. So, the average charge going to each cell is 1023/2 = 512 mAh (or 520 mAh for the second battery) which better fits with the 392 mAh the battery produced during the second test. (Batteries are less than 100% efficient: Generally, mAh-Out = mAh-In minus inefficiency.)Obviously, even though these tests only provide approximate capacity data, the results put both batteries no where near their claimed capacity of 1300 mAh. I've had good results with Jesspow products in the past and am at a loss to explain this discrepancy. Other than to say that, based on my knowledge and experience with batteries, it may be unlikely there is enough space to put even two, 1300 mAh Lithium cells inside a 9-volt battery case. See, the fully-charged voltage of common Lithium cells is 4.2 volts. Thus, in order to reach 9 volts, something else is going on inside the Jesspow 9-volt battery cases. Something similar to what goes on inside power banks to allow them to produce 5 volts from Lithium cells because those cells are just producing 4.2 volts, or less, depending on their state of discharge.Then again, the capacity of 9-volt alkaline batteries ranges from under 300 mAh to almost 500 mAh for discharge rates in the 100 to 500 mA range. So, based on my testing, these Jesspow batteries compare favorably with their Alkaline counterparts. And, even though you might not get the claimed 1300 mAh capacity, you will get performance which is comparable to Alkaline capacity and which is superior when it comes to delivering a nearly constant voltage throughout their discharge curves. However, as these Jesspow batteries neared their fully discharged state, their output voltage dropped very quickly to zero.In addition to the battery capacity issue, no covers were provided for the battery terminals. Because these batteries are intended to last indefinitely, and will need to be stored between uses, preventing accidental contact with the battery terminals is a fairly obvious concern. Nine volt batteries and steel wool have been used by campers and survivalists for starting camp fires. Thus, these batteries are far from inert when it comes to short-circuiting their terminals.

Don't believe you have to change them every 6 months, its a waste of money. Spring forward turn back who cares! Just do it once a year. Pick your favorite calendar month then replace all your smoke alarm batteries one year from that month. It could be the month of your birthday or your wedding anniversary whatever is special to you. Now why do I like these batteries? Because there is enough in this package to replace all of my smoke detectors and they are easy to put into my First Alert smoke detector. Should have had this before getting married! However, these batteries should work in most if not all smoke detectors. Have you ever gone to the store looking for 9 volt batteries having to buy more than you wanted because you could not get the quantity needed. This is why I now buy my batteries from Amazon. Quick and easy you don't have to waste time money and gas looking for batteries ever again. Why get charged up over batteries?. If you want to get charged up then watch the NFL when the Chargers play! So I would suggest change your batteries once a year not twice unless you have nothing else to do, order them from Amazon, pick your special month for installing them in your smoke detectors. Sit back and relax till next year when its time again. You might even include doing this with your favorite drink but will save that for another time. Just remember please use caution when changing batteries in a smoke detector especially when using a ladder.

They are identical in every way except for the naming conventions (R14s or C LR14). Based on the info from the sellers website, the shelf life of these batteries is 7 years NOT 10 years as advertised in the product description. They are also a little pricey, at $2.25 per battery (8PK) vs $1.87 per battery (8PK of Duracell) vs $1.62 per battery (8PK Energizer).The seller, DURNERGY Inc. is the Canadian branch (based in Toronto) of Shenzhen PKCELL Battery Co LTD, and they claim to be one of the largest battery manufacturing enterprises in China. PKCELL launched the Canadian branch, DURNERGY Inc., in 2014.BONUS INFOBased on a little research on the subject of alkaline batteries, here are a few suggestions to keep in mind. • Store batteries in a cool, dry place • Remove batteries when you don’t expect to use a device for a while • When more than one battery is needed in a device, we always use batteries of the same type. • If a battery leaks and makes contact with your skin or eyes, rinse well with plenty of cold water • Used batteries should be disposed of ASAP and kept out of reach of children • For information about throwing out or recycling, check out call2recycle.org or earth911.com • Store your spare batteries in a small zip-lock bag or battery organizer • If a battery feels hot, don’t use it! • Don’t try to recharge non-rechargeable batteries. They can explode!Bottom Line: C-sized alkaline batteries are recyclable like any other battery, but it is worth noting that rechargeable lithium batteries could be a more “green” choice, so we are giving these batteries an overall 4-star rating based on the sellers' promise that all of their “batteries are fully charged, provide maximum power, are ultra long-lasting and free of mercury, cadmium and lead, making them safe for the environment and safe for daily household or business use.”Therefore, you can “Keep the Juice Flowing” with these batteries, and we can comfortably recommend them for use in medium drain applications, like Flashlights, Toys, Remote Controls, Radios, Clocks, Motorized Toys, Automatic Faucets, Soap Dispensers, Wall Clocks and many other types of everyday household items."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 25, 2023', 'is_verified': False}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great Shelf Life', 'author': 'Charles H.', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I love that these batteries have a ten year shelf life.

In this short period of time I’ve learned their is a difference between different types and strengths of rechargeable batteries. Ni-MH rechargeable batteries are usually less powerful than lithium ion rechargeable batteries. Moral of the story is not all rechargeable. batteries are the same. Lithium ion rechargeable batteries usually are better than Ni-MH batteries. However, you can not compare lithium's mWh to a Ni-MH mAh, they are not apples to apples. These 1200 mWh are between a Ni-MH 700-1000 mAh. My other set of 2600 mWh AA lithium ion batteries produced a brighter light that outlasts, as well as, out-performs the other AA Ni-MH batteries.

As you can tell in the picture the short candle has the CT-Energy brand of three 1200 mWh lithium ion batteries in it, it is the brightest candle in the front row. The candle just to the right in the picture has one lithium ion and two strong 1000 mah Ni-MH batteries. The candle that is to the left is only Ni-MH batteries. The first day it’s hard to notice the difference but the short candle's light was whiter. However as each day passes the Ni-MH candles gets dimmer and more yellow as the battery life diminishes quickly. Unfortunately, after 3 days these lithium batteries lost their luster and the NiMH batteries outshined the lithium batteries. From my experience having both rechargeable batteries, the lithium ion batteries should be superior to the NI-MH rechargeable batteries. I am not sure why these batteries are not outlasting the Ni-MH batteries. These batteries came with their own charger, this charger only charges lithium ion rechargeable batteries. It will not charge Ni-MH batteries. The charger charges up to 4 batteries at once and can accommodates both AAA or AA rechargeable batteries.

They charged with a current of 0.5A per battery or 0.65A for a single battery. While charging the end of the battery flashes green. When solid green, the batteries are charged.This kind of lithium battery has internally a buck regulator to reduce the voltage to 1.5V. This means that the voltage is constant until the battery is totally discharged. Because of the switching regulator there is some switching noise on the output which might cause a problem for some applications. I measured about 10mVp-p with no load. With some load there was very low switching noise. Better than other batteries I have seen.The batteries rated capacity is 1460mAh (2200mWh). This is less than some alkaline batteries but about the same as NiMH batteries. To get some of idea of the actual capacity, I used a resistor load with a current of about 560mA. At that current the voltage dropped some, but stayed constant over time. The battery did not get very warm. After 2.5 hours the battery shut down. After removing the load the voltage was 1.11V. So the capacity (560mA * 2.5 hours = 1400mAh) agrees well with the specification.Recharging the battery took about 1.5 hours at 0.65A for a single battery.One potential problem with these batteries is the self discharge.

NiMH batteries don't work well, I think because they start at a lower voltage (1.2V instead of the 1.5V of lithium and alkaline batteries).

I won’t be taking them camping or anywhere where I don’t have a charger and fresh set at the ready. If I have any cons, it’s really just a nitpick.

I’ll remember that they are, but I can see a family member or guest not realizing they are rechargeable and throwing them out when replacing them in a device.Despite my nitpick, for around seventeen dollars for a pair of them, it is a decent value and great for adding extra batteries to your stockpile for those times when you just need another 9V battery or two to get keep you going.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States July 8, 2023', 'is_verified': False}]"

Anyway, we used to go thru batteries like it was candy and cake, meaning a lot of batteries. So many batteries I would regularly fill one gallon ziplock bags with used ones. I didnt want them in the regular trash and brought them to our recycling center. Well, I would take approximately 1-2 bags a month. They were heavy and almoast always broke open on the ride over. And they took up a good chunk of cabinet space, and we need all the space we can get. So now that I have rechargeables all that is no more. No saving, no carrying, no more buying, no more girlfriends cuz my wife found out! So no more of so many things I never realized how much it was costing in money, time and space, (girlfriends are costly let me tell you). It truely is life changing. And the switch over was easy. So, instead of buying batteries for the month, I started buying rechargeables and little by little the battery powered devices started all having rechargeables. Now instead of tossing them I put them on the 16 space charger and when done they get put into a charged battery bucket. Everyone gets fresh batteries from there whenever needed. It is so satisfying to not have to spend all that money. Now it took about 6 months to get everything switched over because I didnt want to spend anymore than I was already spending on batteries so it took longer for us to get where we are today and that is 100% rechargeables. And they last just as long, work just as well , and cost zero each month. Now, I expect to spend a few bucks in another year or so to replace any that start to fail, but thats an enormous savings compared to the old way, and it didnt hurt one bit making the switch. So I cant say enough good about rechargeables and Im not allowed to mention the girlfriends anymore, but now that the batteries arent an issue and I dont have to deal with all those things those old batteries required my wife is much happier.

So, if you're burning through batteries quickly on things like flashlights, security cameras, RC cars, etc, these not only outperform the old versions, they save weight, making them easier to carry.I was very happy with the way these performed in one of my son's favorite RC robot toys.

The voltage aligns more with a standard alkaline AA battery. That means you can use it in your high voltage required things like your smart dead bolt or thermostat, however I wouldn't suggest that since those aren't high power uses.Form Factor: The form factor is great. I'd throw these in my travel bag or camera bag with a single USB charger to make sure that my flash had enough juice. they're great for travel because you don't need a bulky (or additional) charger for the batteries. At the same time though, this limits the number of batteries you can charge to however many USB cables you have.Package contents:It does come with a single USB-A to Dual USB-C cable. This means that the input to the battery is limited to the USB 1 spec since there's likely not power handshake. Since the batteries are spec'ed at 500 mA input, that should be fine.Overall, great product, but $5 per battery is a little steep when you consider Eneloops are cheaper.

The converter consumes some power even when there's no load on the battery so it turns off unless a load is detected. It only takes a very tiny amount of current to turn it on and it stays on for some time after the load is removed. The output is a very stable voltage very close to 1.5 volts until the battery is completely discharged at which time it instantly drops to zero. This can be an advantage in devices that are sensitive to battery voltage but a disadvantage in devices like flashlights that you don't want to abruptly quit without warning.Because the majority of energy in an alkaline cell is delivered at a voltage between 1.2 and about 0.9, any properly designed device designed for alkaline cells should be able to use NiMH cells and function properly down to at least 1.0 volt per cell. Fortunately, most devices do. The only one I've got that quits working between 1.5 and 1.2 volts per cell is an outdoor thermometer module, and a drone controller gives a low battery warning in that range. It turns out that these batteries aren't very suitable for either application. I doubt that the converter is very efficient at the tiny current consumed by the thermometer. And since the voltage of these batteries stays at a constant voltage until abruptly dropping to zero when discharged, I'd get no warning of a low battery with the controller.But there are other applications where these will be very useful. When I travel or camp I have some devices like a headlamp which use one or more AA cells, and with these I won't need to bring spare batteries or a separate AA cell charger. I can conveniently recharge them with the USB chargers or power banks I always have along. (But I'll have to tolerate a headlamp or flashlight going dark instantly, or make sure I never let the batteries completely discharge.)How about capacity? I measured one sample at a constant current discharge of 250mA and 1A. At 250mA, the battery delivered 1.77Ah (2.70Wh at 1.53V). This is competitive with an NiMH cell. At 1A such as you might need for a flashlight, it delivered 1.62Ah (2.45Wh at 1.51V). And while they're probably not intended to deliver 2A for any length of time, I got 1.31Ah (1.83Wh at 1.49V) and no sign of excessive heating when discharging at that rate. So these will be good for general purpose uses where USB charging is convenient.I knocked off one star because one of the four ports of the charge adapter was DOA which gives me reservations about the quality control."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States April 1, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Very nice', 'author': 'gregory lockwood', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'So far these work great and charging them all at once is very nice.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 8, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great battery', 'author': 'Sinaj', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'These are great, charges quick.

It is rare to find honest advertising in non name brand batteries.Includes the 4 way micro USB charging cable and a battery storage case.I utilize a bank of simple discharge testing circuits. Conducting tests with a load of 200mA the batteries shut off after 2592mWh. That is 99.7% of rated capacity of 2600mWh. Testing with a load of 385mA, the batteries shut off after 2482-2523mWh or about 96% of rated capacity. These are very good results. There is no maximum current rating for these batteries, so I did not test at a higher load. Three of the batteries maintained a voltage of 1.46 during the tests, but one only maintained 1.39V while testing. Before the batteries cutoff at the end, the voltage did drop down to 1.0-1.1V for several minutes. Depending on the device, this may provide a low battery warning. This type of battery is known for maintaining 1.5V until it is discharged and then shutting off (0V). Having a period of time where the voltage drops to below 1.2V allows devices to indicate a low battery condition.After fully discharging the batteries I charged them connected to a USB adapter capable of 3A. While charging the batteries flash a blue light (see video). When complete the blue light is constant.

While the XTARs were the best experience out of those, all of them fell short in key ways. They all self-discharged rapidly. Their capacity claims are purportedly for the lithium cell inside, not the power you can expect to be delivered to the device after conversion. So rather than claim the companies are lying about the internal cell I'll just say that their designs are terribly inefficient at stepping down the 3.7v of the internal lithium cell, with the exception of XTAR which was just mildly inefficient. The biggest issue being a significantly cheaper Ni-MH cell will outperform every one of these batteries in runtime (the XTAR being the best performer had less runtime than a standard Eneloop in an LED flashlight), the only situation where these lithium cells make sense is where having a constant 1.5v is critical to the devices operation, but this also makes it impossible to know how much power is remaining in the batteries as you use them. The XTARs (newest model as of this review) have a feature that drops the voltage to 1.2v as the internal cell battery voltage runs low, but this is so close to empty that it might as well be empty in any high-drain application where these batteries would be an appropriate choice over Ni-MH.These Coast batteries are a huge leap in the right direction. Using my SkyRC NC2200 I am getting between 2600-2800mah when discharging at 500mah, more power than is stated by the manufacturer. They also seemed to artificially lower their voltage on a curve as the battery discharges. My Garmin eTrex SE has a feature to tune the battery gauge to specific battery chemistries, and to my surprise the only accurate setting was the one for Alkaline.The built-in charging is important for my use as well. I plan on using these for multi-day camping / backpacking trips. I only want to carry one battery bank and one type of cable for the trip and charge all my devices that way to minimize items and weight. With these batteries my handheld GPS and headlamp can last multiple days use, I can tell when they need to be charged, and if they need to be charged I can do so without an extra charger or cable in my bag.There are a couple of cons. The biggest is the price. $10 per cell is kind of insane, but just try and find another rechargeable lithium AA that compares right now. Another con is weight. These weigh considerably more than disposable lithium cells which are also more energy dense. For backpacking, it would be seriously worth the effort to understand how long your AA devices last and if you should just go disposable and bring a couple extra disposables. Another con is that these cells are now only on-par with some of the high capacity Ni-MH batteries which are considerably cheaper."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 15, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Work well', 'author': 'Edward A.

The ease of simply inserting the USB-C cable into the side of the battery for charging is a game-changer. This feature eliminates the need for a separate charger and makes recharging a breeze. Unlike some other rechargeable batteries with a 1.2V output, the Coast AA batteries boast a full 1.5V. This means they match the performance of traditional alkaline batteries, providing reliable and consistent power for all your devices. The promise of up to 1000 recharge cycles is impressive. It not only makes these batteries an eco-friendly choice but also ensures long-term cost savings. The prospect of a thousand recharges speaks to the durability and sustainability of the Coast AA batteries.One downside worth noting is the length of the charging cord provided. Unfortunately, it's extremely short, which can be inconvenient depending on your charging setup. Users may need to position their devices close to the power source during charging or opt for a longer USB-C cable."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 19, 2023', 'is_verified': False}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars This may be the future of rechargeable batteries.', 'author': 'Gary B.', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'For those of us who like the idea of generating less waste for landfills, rechargeable batteries have always been appealing. Unfortunately for many of us, the reality of rechargeables is that they haven\'t been able to compete with the long-life and reliability of single-use alkaline batteries.However, this Coast brand battery may the future of rechargeables. My first experience using them in a high-drain audio device--the Zoom F3 field recorder--was pretty impressive. On a full charge, the Coast battery life seemed to compete, if not exceed what I\'d expect from my throwaway Duracells.One advantage to these is the built-in USB-C ports on each battery. Using that port, you can charge all four batteries with one provided cable. Meaning, you don\'t have to carry around a charging device to recharge these batteries. When they\'re fully charged, which doesn\'t take long, the red light on the top of the battery turns green. It couldn\'t be easier. The challenge, of course, is how do you keep track of this four-in-one charging cable? (Where do I put it so I always remember where it\'s at?)The other thing that was a little concerning is how difficult it was to disconnect the batteries from this cable after they were charged. It\'s good they have a strong connection, but I was a bit nervous tugging hard to get them disconnected.The price tag also might slow people down a bit. Buying a four pack, they\'re $10 a battery. BUT, if it\'s true they can handle, as they claim, ""over 1,000 charges"", (which I cannot attest to, having only charged them twice so far), they would more than pay for themselves. After 1000 charges, for example, each battery would have cost you one cent. (Sounds too good to be true, doesn\'t it?)Like I said, it would be awesome if I could personally verify the 1,000 charges claim. But if these batteries DON\'T hold up, the company that makes them (coastportland.com) warranties that they will be ""free of defects to materials and workmanship for the life of the original purchaser."" So if you were born in the year 2000, you can track down the folks at Coast in 2080 and get a replacement...well, if you can prove the batteries failed because of ""defects in material and workmanship."" But hey, if you charged them less than 1,000 times, I\'m hoping they\'ll have your back.Frankly, I\'m rooting for this company. I like what they\'re doing and I hope these batteries provide power for my devices for years to come.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 12, 2023', 'is_verified': False}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Charge last longtime', 'author': 'Amazon Customer', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'These are very cool batteries!

To be fair, that also seems to be what I am going to be able to expect from rechargeables. I tested them in my battery checker and the meter was just over into the green part showing me a healthy battery. Fresh disposables always go at least halfway into the green. Wanting to be impartial, I took out the fully charged batteries in my solar lantern and did the same test. The results were the same. My son had a couple of older rechargeables in one of his toys, so I charged them up and tested them out. Same results. I guess rechargeables are better in lower draw applications.

So we pay crazy prices for batteries that we just toss in the garbage when they are used up. Solution? Buy these rechargeable NiMH batteries and buy a charger. I have a charger that can do both AA and AAA NiMH rechargeable batteries. The voltage of NiMH battereis does not get higher than 1.3 volts when fully charged but that makes no difference in the majority of devices in which you will use them. When I received these batteries, I gave them a good charge even though they come pre-charged at approximately 1.2 volts. They are a hefty 2800mAh (mili-amp hour or 2.8 amp hour) which compares to any high quality disposable battery. This matters because this is what is drained as the battery is being used and causes the voltage to drop.

The other advantage of the rechargables is you never run out of batteries. Even if you are using them all in other devices, recharging takes care of that too. It's just a more responsible way of using batteries.That said, these batteries seem to be nicely made. The construction is good and they work well where I've put them, which is mostly in my tv remote and in my computer mouse and keyboard. Generally I've found that I will get years of use out of a rechargable before it ceases to hold a charge for a reasonable amount of time and that's like getting a pack of batteries out of each one.

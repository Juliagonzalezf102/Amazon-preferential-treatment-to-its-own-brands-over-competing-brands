At this point, I own about 8 pairs. They are my go-to 'sitting around at home' pant and I wear them almost every day. They're thin enough to wear in hot weather, but aren't sheer, and the waistband is great (where it cinches in pretty far but can stretch a ton, in the XL it's 15 inches across the waistband un-stretched, and 30 inches when stretched all the way out).There are a few things that I would make a note of, though. Firstly, the different colors have different qualities. The grey is my favorite, it's the stretchiest and softest. The black is stiffer and thicker (but still a go-to for me), and the green is sheerer and more like an upscale legging or almost similar to a thin dress pant (and is my least favorite).These pants can also be quite unflattering. This is because the fit is a little weird (which is sort of expected with 'parachute' pants) but isn't my favorite. I am a little over 200lbs with a mildly athletic build (like, 'athlete who's let themselves go for a few years'), and primarily have these in size XL. The inseam is one of the main issues for me. I have normal length of leg, if not slightly short, where the inside of my leg is about 31 inches long. The inseam for these pants is 24.5 inches long, and there is about 15 inches between the end of the inseam and the top of the waistband. In order to get rid of that extra room, I roll the waistband 1-2x over, so that they generally look and fit like normal pants and so my legs to stick together when I walk. this makes the pants hit me in a weird place, though, like lower calf. The pants also tend to be thin enough to show, if you are not very thin/toned, an unfortunate texture on the thighs. Between these factors, the pants are so ugly even my friends and family have commented that these pants need to stay as house pants and never be worn in public.The only other issue with these is that they do stretch out when you wear them, so they'll be pretty tight for 2-3 wears, then get really loose, then go back to being tight after you wash them. They also wear in certain places and eventually get holes, but it takes a while to get to that point.In general, I find the grey and black versions of this to be amazing for working at home, doing chores, or laying around (or even sleeping), but are not great for going out. They're super comfortable and work in most types of mild weather, and because of that, I plan to continue buying more of these in the future."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States July 9, 2022', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '1.0 out of 5 stars Cheap', 'author': 'Regina B', 'rating': 1, 'content': 'For the price of the product you would expect higher quality.

Why? Because you can\'t try it on before you buy it, and that can be a real hassle, right? But I took a gamble (again) due to the fact that it seems all my pants have shrunk over the last few months (wink) and I discovered other than sweats, I had no pants to wear. So, I purchased 3 pairs of these cargo-pants. Ok, now I\'m going to embarrass myself, but I\'m doing this to try and help you guys out, so cut me some slack. I\'m 5\' 10"", 260 lbs. with a 53"" waist and my leg length from belly button to floor is 42"". Yes, I\'m a cow, so let\'s just get that out of the way. (oh, I don\'t really believe I\'m a cow, I just know I look like one) Ok, so, I ordered 3x size pants and the chart says they fit 35""-49"" waist and are 44.5"" in length.They arrived today and I tried one pair on. Much to my surprise, they fit great with even a couple of inches of room to spare around the waist. Remember, I have a 53"" waist measured across the greatest girth (belly button level) and the size chart says 3x fits up to 49"". So, the chart isn\'t exactly on target, and I might even fit into the 2x, but I\'m not going to get a pair of those just to see if I could. Now about the length. The length seems to be accurate with the chart, 44.5"". I have some room to play with at the bottom and I\'m curious to see where they end up after washing. Other reviews claim some serious shrinking in length, by as much as 1.5""s after wash. If that is the case, then the bottoms should end up right on top of my shoes, and that\'s fine, though I would prefer just a little longer.The colors (I bought Black, Coffee, Brown) are very nice, especially the Coffee, really nice dark color. As for the material, lightweight, but not too light, feels durable but not stiff at all, very comfortable and easy to move, bend, squat in.Concerns: Not sure how durable the button closure is going to be, feels a bit flimsy, but buttons can always be replaced (right, honey?). The other concern is, again, shrinking after washing. I\'ve read some other reviews and this issue seems to be a common thread in them. However, I do have about 2"" of play at the bottom, so I\'d imagine that even with some shrinking, I should end up ok. There is about 1"" of hemmed up material that could be unstitched if it shrinks more than acceptable.I would certainly recommend these at this point. Probably would even if they shrunk an inch or so.

I bought an xxl to be loose and comfortable at work. I gained Covid year weight and want to hide my belly, until I lose it. They look huge holding them up and even in a mirror at first glance but actually fall nicely; with a tank top and tshirt they look like nice loosely styled pants. They have a good draw string to adjust to your waist size and cinch them in. The pockets are deep. I just ordered the camouflage one-size down because I was afraid of going too large with a pattern. I tried them on they fit perfect... can't wait to try them at work. Just practicing bending and what not, I still feel like the pants moved with me and were comfortable even though they are one size down.

I had no idea whether a medium or a large or XL would fit me. I had no idea if the sizing was American standards so I decided to get different sizes and colors to see which one would suit me best. Often, in foreign sizing standards, L or even XL is too small. The sizing turned out to be very much like American standards. The size medium fit best, but though I liked the lightweight fabric and the elastic comfort waist, one problem was the pockets. Oh they were roomy and had zippers which is great actually but this style has a cargo pocket on the left leg and though it does not bellow out like the cargo pockets of military pants or tactical pants, the zipper is at a location so that when you swing your arms along your sides as you walk, your left hand will constantly be coming against the zipper pull (unless your arms are short enough). Also though the pants would be good for exercising in, or going to the gym, or biking, or jogging, or going camping etc, they had a bit too much of a baggy fit on me and the material was too much like knit material that sags and it would not have been versatile enough for general use. Also it was a little too long on me. I don't know about the long term durability, or how it stands up to regular washing or whether it is quick dry. I regretted that I had to send all the ones I ordered back. They were not right enough for me. I don't know if I might be able to use one at a later time.I would still recommend them if you are of the right dimensions or height. Do not hesitate to try them just because I say they were not exactly what I was looking for. They are comfortable and SEEM to be good to wear on a long flight or bus ride if you travel.

Requested Zoulee by email to introduce more colors which they responded back saying they would soon. This has turned out to be one of the best comfortable products I have bought in many years.End of Update 2.12.19For the past many years I have been looking for Sweatpants that are (a) Good Quality (b) Comfort fit with some good room in the crotch area, i.e. moderate to high rise instead of the sickening low rise pants that have half the world showing their bottom crack in sitting positions (c) Has Front Fly Zipper (d) Can wear to WorkThe few I found in the market were either very poor quality or extremely expensive. I had been passing through this Zoulee\'s sweatpant page quite a few times, but the kind of sizing they displayed for this product made me skeptical, but in the end decided to give it a try.I ordered the M size for my waist size of 35"". Something didn\'t seem right, so I emailed Zoulee and they immediately replied back that they will swap the size as the S size would be the better fit for me.The pants came in this morning (a few weeks later) and I am very very impressed. Sweat pants quality? Check, Awesome Mix of Cotton and Nylon with some stretch in the fabric. Comfort fit? Check. It has enough room in the rise to comfortably sit high on my waist. Snug fit at the waist and comfort straight fit down below. Wear to Work? Check. They simply drape like a regular formal pant - I think the nylon and the way the fabric is cut does the trick. Bonus points: They don\'t wrinkle in the few hours I have worn them like cotton or linenAnd finally Fly Front Zipper? BIG CHECK. Yes, these pants DO HAVE ZIPPER FLY. The other two reviews said ""no zipper fly"" so I emailed Zoulee again to make sure these pants had zipper fly. They replied back confirming their pants hat front fly zipper and were helpless and did not understand why two reviewers said their pants did not have zippers. I felt sorry for Zoulee and more so now, seeing the super quality of their pants and the fact that they do have zipper front fly.Will update this review in a few months to see how the quality of pant survives the wear and tear and look for pilling etc.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 27, 2019', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '1.0 out of 5 stars The fit, different from the other pants that I had purchased from you.', 'author': 'Amazon Customer', 'rating': 1, 'content': 'I did not like the fit, bought about five pair in 3 years, the last pair the legs were very wide and the length was longer witch will require alterations.I don‚Äôt know why , I ordered the same size and same style and the same color.

They are also wicking, very light and breathable. The pockets are a neat touch and they seem durable. I haven‚Äôt tested the pockets out fully yet, but so far so good, I‚Äôll edit if otherwise.So why did I give it only 3 stars versus 5? It might be a little harsh, but hear me out, the main reason we all shop online is because we don‚Äôt want to deal with stores and changing rooms, amiright!? So we all try our hardest to ensure we have the right size in order to avoid returns. Sure, Amazon has an amazing return policy and system, but it‚Äôs still a hassle we as customers should be able to avoid as much as possible. So it‚Äôs very crucial as a clothing company to ensure you have an accurate size chart/guide and that is not the case here. Let‚Äôs pretend that it doesn‚Äôt have a weird funky listing of the ‚ÄúBrand‚Äùs sizes vs the US that aren‚Äôt even listed in the options such as 3XL-6XL (this is clearly not the brand sizes they are selling) and let‚Äôs just focus on the listed US sizes. Those sizes are not accurate. If you look at the transition of the waist inches they are only roughly an inch difference. Look at any other size guide on a normal clothing website and this is not the case. Already it looks suspicious. But hey I decided to take a shot at it anyway!I am 5‚Äô9, 270 pounds, and my measurements are 43 waist, 53 hip, and 32 inseam and I was able to get the XX-L and they are actually very fitting. In a rough comparison I would be a 3XL in Addidas and Nike pants for women, for example. The size chart is completely wacko. According to them I should not be able to even step into that size. Hopefully they see this and update that, because honestly I‚Äôve seen it so many times on Amazon now that I‚Äôm starting to think it‚Äôs the site.Also, some have complained of it being way too long. I haven‚Äôt had this issue, but I don‚Äôt wear them below my crotch like some guys do. I wear them roughly halfway between my waist and my hips. I could still wear them on my hips, but the pants are slightly, only slightly longer than usual( I personally like this) so they would almost hit the floor, but not quite.I highly recommend them if you can translate your size through reviews and I would buy them again, I just think I got lucky with my sizing, but I don‚Äôt think it should be a guessing game, I consider that playing with customers‚Äô time and money, so hence the three stars.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States April 23, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Very comfortable!!', 'author': 'Fred', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I was honestly super worried I was gonna end up with a size too small or too big or something but no!

I'm happy to say the elastic has gotten much looser to the point im not complaining how tight they are (in fact, reading my review from 2 years ago shocked me- totally forgotten as they fit well right now!). I don't recall if I ever bothered hemming the leg cuffs - I think I just decided to live with it & happy to say that I don't see any tears stepping on the extra length from time to time like my last pair of dance pants. So all in all, if it says anything, I just bought another pair in white & was happy to pay $20 on Prime Day (though $15 would have been better, I am satisfied with my first pair given the abuse they've been through!). Never done this before & adding a star as this is 5 stars for those of you that have slim bodies like me - you'll be plenty happy!UPDATE (July 19, 2023): bumping back down to 4 stars - sizing is inconsistent across colors (see photos). in the mismatched photo, the black one is the one I bought 2 years ago that fits great. I got my 2nd pair today and you can see how much bigger it is. they are *both* large. reached out to seller to resolve this. very frustrating.UPDATE (July 24, 2023): a total of 6 purchases later and 4 returns, I've discovered my original Large Black (from 2021) is the *same* size as my Small White (2nd photo, 2023). Now the good news is I think over the past 2 years, they've gotten the actual size of the pants to match the sizing chart (so trust the sizing chart now! #yeay). so I'm just gonna chaulk this up as progress on behalf of the company. I love both my pants at the end of the day - they are super comfy & practical! leaving the rest of my review for context & impressions from 2021The biggest issue is the horrendous sizing. I am completely shocked given how skinny I am - I have a 28-29‚Äù waist and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù tall - the size chart says ‚Äú30.7-34.6‚Äù and what BS! I exchanged sizes twice to Medium and Large (33.0-37.0‚Äù) and it is still too tight! The real fault in the design is there are pull strings and they failed to make the elastic *loose* and let you use the drawstrings to take up for the slack (this is how my other pair of sweatpants with elastic work)on top of that, the length of the pants are too long - Small was too long and by the time I got to Large to help ease up on the waist, it‚Äôs even longer. Now I need to go through the trouble of hemming the length (which is doable - just prefer not to have had to go through the trouble)It really dumbfounds me for garments made in China, that these do not fit a typical Asian build (I‚Äôve done a lot of shopping in Thailand for clothes) - I can‚Äôt imagine these pants being comfortable for a typical American build - you‚Äôll be lucky if XL feels comfortable on you.Other than that, I like the material, it‚Äôs lightweight, dries fast and I got them because I am a dancer so I wanted my dance stripes (though these are super subtle - I kinda wish they had the standard white stripe on black (they only have black stripes on white) - so be it) and the one must have feature are zippered pockets - i absolutely can‚Äôt stand loosing car keys, wallet, etc with standard athletic pants when you sit down!I can‚Äôt wait for this elastic to go bad - it‚Äôs just so *tight* even with the drawstrings untied!

I don\'t think they will shrink much, if at all, but the extra long waist string will be able to tighten pretty good. The pockets other than the back pockets are well placed and deep.

If you think they look good on the model, you\'ll probably like how they look in person.The bad: Everything else. The fit on these is in my opinion, terribly accurate. What this means is, you order the 32 Regular, that\'s exactly what it will fit. So if you\'re like me, and have a body that is not perfectly proportional, you will want to base your size choice on your legs, not your waist. I wear 32x34 pants, and these legs are 100% made for a 32 inch inseam. They go down to my ankle only when perfectly straight, so once I do that crazy thing called ""walking,"" they ride up my shins a few inches. And on the subject of the ankles, somehow Coofandy found the only version I\'ve seen of polyester that doesn\'t stretch, so when trying to take these off, the ankles barely open enough to get around my foot. When wearing socks I can either choose to take them off first to make it easier, or they\'re just going to come off in the process anyways.My last gripe is Sky Blue, since you may be thinking ""I\'m sure the picture is just taken in dark place,"" but no, the choice called Sky Blue looks exactly that shade of ""blue."" Its possible this is a London-based company, and that\'s just what they think the sky looks like, but in my world that\'s Blue-grey. In the end though, the color being labeled weirdly is the least of my problems with these. The thing about clothes that look nice but fit poorly/uncomfortably, is I\'m the one that has to wear them; everyone else gets to ""enjoy"" them more than me, since all they have to do is see them, not be in them. Mediocre at best is all I can give these, so a 3/5 seems reasonable.

I swear, it wasn‚Äôt intentional. I was looking for a lightweight lounge pant for fall and late spring in the northeast. I ordered 4 pairs at first and was disappointed by all of them, so I ordered more. Thankfully my next batch had winners. Here are my reviews and rankings.(1st Place) Ritiriko Women's Joggers with Pockets, High Waist Yoga Capri Pants for Running Workout Lounge: My favorites! I pulled these out of the bag and I thought they would be too tight and small. The waist was the perfect fit and it managed to be fitted without feeling tight. The material isn‚Äôt cozy or super soft but it is smooth and very comfortable.(2nd Place) SPECIALMAGIC Sweatpants Lounge Wear for Women Ankle Length Loose Fit Casual Pants Baggy Workout Active Cropped: My second favorites! I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù and these hit me right at my ankle but could also be pulled up. These were SO SOFT and the waistband was comfortably loose. These are a lower-quality dupe for Boody Eco Wear lounge pants. I actually returned the Boodys because for $60+ I expected something softer. Something like this! Of course, Boody‚Äôs lounge pants are made of bamboo and sustainable, whereas these are rayon, so, of course not ideal, but so dang comfy and only $20. Also, I think these look a little better on than pictured. I got it in black.(3rd Place) Yogipace Petite/Regular/Tall Women's 7/8 On The Fly Pants Drawstring Casual Lounge Joggers Travel Sweatpants: I reaaaally liked these. At 5‚Äô4‚Äù the 27‚Äù length was perfect. These had a little more weight than most other pants. Very sturdy waistband. If you don‚Äôt like cozy soft and prefer a smooth, heavier soft (hope that makes sense), these will be good for you. These are nylon. The waistband on these was pretty loose and there‚Äôs lots of slack in the drawstrings for adjustment. You might want to consider sizing down, and you definitely want to if you have a small waist.Amazon Brand - Core 10 Women's Yoga CoreCloud Fleece Jogger: These were a great, comfy, cozy, fleece-lined lounge pant but were too warm for what I was looking for. These would be great in the winter. I didn‚Äôt keep them because I already have winter lounge pants. Very similar to the Ann Taylor LOFT Outlet Super Soft line. The price point is about the same if you watch LOFT Outlet sales. I prefer the LOFT Outlet style because they are cozier and the waistband is thick and high-rise.KEEPBEAUTY Womens Active Yoga Sweatpants Loose Workout Joggers Pants Comfy Lounge Pants with PocketsANDDIBAOLONG Womens Yoga Pants Wide Leg Loose Drawstring Comfy Lounge Workout Sweatpants with Pockets Cameo M^ These are the same! The exact same, folks. Lol. So the material of these was suuuuper soft and cozy, lightweight, loved it. The catch was the waistband. I found it a little tight and uncomfortable. And it didn‚Äôt have a drawstring to loosen. This wasn‚Äôt a sizing issue, because the legs were loose even on my thick thighs. If you have a slim waist you should def get these. If you don‚Äôt you might want to avoid.CRZ YOGA Women's Stretch Lounge Sweatpants Travel Ankle Drawstring 7/8 Athletic Track Yoga Dress Pants: These seemed to be high-quality and were very comfortable without being cozy soft. I definitely wondered if I could get away with wearing these to the office; they were very flattering. These would be perfect for wearing over short shorts or a bathing suit in the winter on the way to the gym or studio. I am not keeping them for lounge purposes.Sarin Mathews Womens Yoga Pants Pleated Wide Leg Loose Comfy Lounge Pants Workout Sweatpants for Women with Pockets: These are a really soft, comfortable material and fit beautifully. You could totally get away with wearing these to the office. If you practice yoga and don‚Äôt like how fitted typical yoga pants are, these are a great alternative. I don‚Äôt think the model photo does these pants justice. Watch the product video to see how they really look. Again, though, they were tight in the waist for me. I don‚Äôt mind this amount of tightness when I am out and about but I wanted something looser for lounge. I could have sized up but the pant legs were already a tad too long on me.BALEAF EVO Women's Skinny Cotton Joggers Sweatpants Tapered Casual Lounge Jogging Pants Fitted Yoga Workout Pocketed PantsANDBALEAF Women's Cotton Sweatpants Cozy Joggers Pants Tapered Active Yoga Lounge Casual Travel Pants with Pockets^ Again these are the EXACT same thing. Even though I ordered these in the same size, one arrived with an inch larger waistband than the other. I don‚Äôt know which one is which because other than that they are identical, so, sorry, can‚Äôt advise as to which one you should get if you want the larger waistband. Lol! I would wish you luck in figuring it out, but honestly, these aren‚Äôt great. The material is rough and the seams are unattractive.

The material is light enough to wear for spring/summer but durable enough to exercise in. There is some stretch to it and the material feels nice - think, athleisure. I am typically a size 6, 28"", and ordered size small. The fit is perfect, it doesn\'t squeeze the butt and thighs -i do have some curves- and it just caresses the bumm thighs nicely. It\'s just tight enough to feel like a layer over the skin with slight looseness. The only thing I don\'t like about the pants are the protruding pockets, other then that it\'s a nice pair of pants.

I got a navy pair just for golfing in cooler weather after learning they were a dupe for a notorious -lemon brand. Loved them. When I learned that for my new job black golf style pants are recommended I immediately ordered two pairs in black. I got XXS and XS to see which I liked better but actually kept both. Both fit just fine. The XS has a *slightly* higher rise and are a tiny bit longer. There may be a smidge more room in the hips. I thought I would prefer one size over the other but now would like to order a third pair to help keep the weekly laundry down and can‚Äôt decide if I want another XXS or another XS. I am 5‚Äô3‚Äù about 115. I normally wear 0/00 in pants. I have not tried the real version of these copycat pants but find them comfortable, lightweight, stretchy, the waist band isn‚Äôt too thick, doesn‚Äôt cut in, also isn‚Äôt too tight relative to the fit of the rest of the pant. They seem to be a ‚Äúnormal rise‚Äù they don‚Äôt ride up. The pockets are nice and big but not lumpy. The pants dry fast if splashed and don‚Äôt seem to hold on to dirt or dust or pet hair. The drawstring lays flat and has little metal bits on the ends that haven‚Äôt fallen off yet in the dryer despite washing every other day. They‚Äôve survived the dryer. They aren‚Äôt too wrinkly if you hang dry. They don‚Äôt seem to snag easily. They don‚Äôt seem to show any wear at all yet even though I‚Äôve not been gentle when wearing or washing. Highly recommend. If I got the real pants for twice the price I‚Äôd be worried about ruining them at work.

I\'m 5\'3"" tall with a short torso, and my measurements are about 44""-33""-44"" (bust-waist-hip) right now, give or take.I found these to be mostly TTS, though I\'d recommend potentially sizing up if you have larger hips/butt. I still had plenty of room but would potentially size up to an XL if I wanted them baggier.The material is super soft and stretchy, more brushed than athletic, though it has a hint of slickness to it. They are super comfortable.The style is interesting, as it looks like it would be a jogger but it\'s cropped instead. I personally hate joggers, so I thought these were a nice change. I have thicker thighs and calves from years of soccer and these were super forgiving in those areas. I\'m a little on the shorter side and found the length was a bit longer than I\'d prefer, but I can just roll them up twice and they\'re perfect, or get them hemmed. In my picture, my left leg has the hem rolled and the right leg does not, so you can see the difference. They hit the top of my foot unrolled.I really like these because they\'re good for running around, working out, or even for casual workwear. I do wish they didn\'t have the logo on the leg and instead had them either on the back of the waistband, and/or made it tonal so it wasn\'t obvious.Overall, I\'d definitely recommend these.

Frequent problem for me is that Medium pants fit well in the waist but are too short, and Large pants have the right length but are too big in the waist. These ones are perfect in the waist AND length. They are SUPER stretchy and allow full range of movement, and the bottom of the legs don\'t slide up when you squat due to the stretch in the material. They are a medium-warmth; not super breathable/flimsy and also not super warm/fleecy. The drawstring is on the outside of the pant which is preferred to the bulk of inner drawstrings, and the drawstring seems to have more sturdy caps to the end of the string than the normal cheap flimsy caps.

Even more difficult to find one that has pockets. You want to add on it being comfortable and non see-through? You're pretty much asking for a miracle. Not sure why women's clothing is rarely made with women actually in mind but that's why it's so difficult. That's also why I am providing you this detailed review to hopefully help you on your journey.Pros:- you can't see through it so nobody will be seeing your undies- light and breathable so you won't be sweating to death in it- has pockets (like real ones and not just for show)- elastic waistband- comfyCon:This is the part that is being updated. This is concerning the fit. The pants have a very loose and comfortable fit in general. They give lots of extra birth around the rear, the thighs, and the calves.They advertise these pants as being extremely elastic so they don't fall down. Well that's not untrue. But these are going to fit vastly differently between women who have washboard stomachs and those who don't. If you have a washboard stomach just buy your regular size and you will love these pants. If you do not have a washboard stomach and you wear these pants on any part of your body which causes them to not rest upon the bone of your hips, you will be uncomfortable.So why did I change this from two stars to 3 stars? Well other than the elastic band cutting off your breathing and making you throw up, the entire rest of the pants are actually extraordinarily excellent and people with washboard stomachs will be able to wear these comfortably. Also, if you still really want these pants since they are actually really great quality pants, you can order one to two sizes up (if you are between sizes then order two sizes up from the smaller of your sizes and if you are a solid size and measure one size up) or you can do like me and actually cut the elastic band out because it has a tie in it and then you just use the tie to keep them on and I have actually found that to be very comfortable. So I gave it an extra star because other than trying to squeeze you a size are too smaller than advertised, they are actually very nice pants."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 19, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Super comfy', 'author': 'Katie-did', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Super comfy! I almost want to wear them as PJs instead of pants. I absolutely LOVE the pockets though. It‚Äôs so much harder than most people think to find pants that aren‚Äôt khaki, denim, or women‚Äôs suit pants (not even always those) and still have pockets. Maybe people think we literally have a purse with us at all times and no need for pockets? I don‚Äôt know but women‚Äôs pants, and generally skirts and dresses too, definitely need pockets and these have them!The only real surprise I had with these pants between the pictures and description was that they had a lower rise waist than I expected, I would even go so far as to say they‚Äôre JUST higher than low rise when worn normally. I CAN hike them up a couple inches, tighten the drawstring just a bit more so they‚Äôll stay, but since they‚Äôre fitted till the legs widen that makes the pockets flare out like when the hips are WAY too big even though the waist fits. So I would disagree with the description of what the waist rise actually is for these even though you can easily buy a size up and wear the drawstring tighter.That and, although it‚Äôs not a big deal, the description implies that these are like the kind of pants that are almost dressy but definitely pants pants, not workout pants or something. However the material is fairly thick (although stretchy) and even though they aren‚Äôt fuzzy inside, they give the impression of sweatpants cut in a wide leg style to look more dressy. If you‚Äôre a confident person and can wear pretty much anything like it‚Äôs a ball gown if you want, you can definitely pull these off as pants pants. Otherwise people will likely wonder if they‚Äôre yoga pants, sweatpants, regular pants, and ask or try to feel the material.Either way you‚Äôll have a very comfortable pair of pants that breathe, are airy for summer (if you‚Äôre like me and hate shorts and/or can‚Äôt pull them off), and thick enough for winter if you use thermals or leggings underneath.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 15, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Love, love, love these amazing pants!!', 'author': 'Meditation Mommy', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'The media could not be loaded.

It may not be enough so you don't buy them, and if you're smaller, I think they do look like the model. My ankles aren't tiny, but these could be a bit tighter to help with the flattery part.

Immediately put them in the wash so I could wear to work the next day (side note I washed regular cycle/dried on low heat like tag stated).I wore to work today and these are my new FAVORITE work pants! I want a pair for every day lol - but so true. They are insanely flattering (hugs in all the right places), ridiculously comfortable, very professional appearance.

Based on the measurements the L would have been the obvious choice because of my hip size. I decided on the M/27"" and it fit perfectly! It has a good amount of stretch and pull up just like regular yoga pants. Putting on/taking off gives zero struggle, super easy - even with my giant hips! They are a bit on the thinner side, so yes ladies if you\'re wearing anything other than a thong panty lines will absolutely show through (if that\'s a deal breaker for you). The length is absolutely PERFECT for me with flats.I got the one with 4 pockets (2 front/2 back). Front pockets are deep and very well constructed. For reference my Galaxy S23 Ultra completely fits in front pockets. Back pockets are on the smaller side, only covers 1/2 of my Galaxy phone, but personally I love the size of the back pockets, any bigger & the overall look might be off.

I can sew somewhat so I can deal with some of those issues if they come up. The Black Streaky one came out the ""cleanest"" with very little lint. The Black Snow ""exploded"" with lint everywhere. Both were washed alone and separately which I would suggest to anyone, certainly at least for the first time. A sticky lint roller took care of both exterior and interior lint. Hopefully this will be the last time I have to seriously deal with that. I\'m 5\'9"" at about 200 lbs. The large size on both will accommodate a waist up to 36"" but it would get a bit tight after that. Both were consistent as to sizing. Length was too long for me and will have to visit the tailor to get hemmed. The material used is different depending on the color. The Black Snow is softer and more pajama-like while the Black Streaky appears to be cut from a somewhat stronger (my impression) material. I guess you could call this a slim cut if you compare it to other gym clothing but it\'s more than roomy enough for me to work out in. I would strongly suggest when you clean these to wash on delicate cycle inside out then spin dry inside-out. DO NOT tumble dry. That just asking for excessive pilling. Either just hang them to dry or use a non-tumble clothes dryer (I have one from Amazon). Would I buy these again? Yes, considering what the prices are in this market. I\'m just working out, going to the beach or shopping in them. As much as I would like to get a couple more of Addidas I\'m not spending 90 bucks plus.

I have purchased both the Keb Jacket as well as the trousers. I'm 5' 10 and 170lbs (normally wear a 31 waist with western jeans). I ordered the medium size jacket and it fits very well. I probably could have fit in small if I wanted a tighter sleeker fit but I wouldn't have any room for baselayers when the temps lower. (I wouldn't suggest getting a large Keb jacket unless you are at least 6' 180lbs.) The same can be said with the trousers. I ordered a size 48 and I have to wear a belt with them. A size 46 would probably have been a more perfect fit for my body type. Also the particular pair that came to me was a 48 LONG. These pants look great even if they are long because of the slim fit in the legs. I'm sticking with the 48 instead of trying to go to a normal 46 because I want to be able to put at least one baselayer underneath these pants. Ideally I would wear a tighter 46 for warmer temperatures and for an even more stylish fit. No one who looks at me would think my 48 doesn't fit. Thats how well tailored Fjallravens clothes are.THE MATERIAL:The Keb jacket and trousers are made of two main materials, a very stretchy polymide and a durable and rugged G-1000 material that Fjallraven has patented. When purchasing Fjallraven gear you must pay very close attention on which parts of their clothing are the greatly esteemed G-1000 material or some other material. This really makes a difference in durability and resistance to the elements. As for the Keb trousers, its one of their trousers that have the least amount of G-1000 material mainly due to versatility being the core of the design. But this doesn't mean the trousers are not durable because the G-1000 material is placed in all the areas that receive more wear. But the polymide on both the pants and jacket are more vulnerable to rough wearing, wind, and moisture than its G-1000 counterpart. After wearing this system in the wind and also the pouring down rain I would say that the polymide areas absorb water quickly. As for the wind, it blocks much more than a fleece but a little less than a softshell jacket would. With the exception of the hood being unusually water resistant, the G-1000 material absorbs rain water as well but it much more wind resistant than the polymide. I do no know how resistant the system is to snow. Although I was suprised at the water absorption I was experiencing it was probably a greater surprise at how fast this system dried out. These issues may seem bad but its qualities like these that make this system viable in hotter seasons as well.ENVIRONMENTAL APPLICATION:Considering the purpose of the Keb design, I am convinced that it performs the best in trekking in dry, open, non-heavy brush environments ranging from 89F - 24F with a thin wool or polyester baselayer for the colder temps. The Keb setup absorbs rainwater fast despite it being advertised as water resistant, however because of its primary synthetic make-up it drys very fast as well.CONCLUSION:I love the quality of Fjallraven's gear so much that I'm buying many more of their pieces. They make different pieces for different uses and enviroments but if you're looking for one general bugout outerlayer the Keb system is one of the most stylish, adaptable, durable, and well-rounded clothing systems on the market today."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States July 19, 2014', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great for bushcraft and camping!', 'author': 'Clark A.

I bought her a different pair of leggings from the same brand before these and got her a Large. They fit her perfect in my opinion. Her only complaint with those first ones is they were tight on the waist after a few hours. So I bought these in XL for her and they fit just as good. The legs are slightly loose, but everything is still accentuated in all the right places. Her butt and legs are still sexy as ever. Over all she\'s more comfortable in the XL but large also fit her well too. For reference my wife is 5\'7"" 180lbs. She doesn\'t have wide hips but has a nice butt. She had to have a C-section with her second child and Dr. said she should\'ve had one with her first child too. So she has the C-section belly.

I hope this gives other women an idea of how these fit for body size.*Update* Since my original review I have purchased many more colors and styles of these leggings for my wife.

First, the camel toe, it\'s like they\'re too short in the crotch seam and you sort of have to keep them pulled up to get the scrunch butt effect, which gives you noticeable (even in black) and uncomfortable camel toe. In comparison to other scrunch butt leggings (I recently bought like 30 diff pairs to try on amazon) they\'re no where close to as buttery soft as others. The stretch is nice & the pockets are amazing (big deep pockets both sides!!!), but they\'re actually loose from the knee down, which again is so odd. The waist band appears wide & flattering in the photos for these pants, but inside that wide part is a 1 inch elastic band that\'s not attached, so it\'s already twisting after just an hour of wear & having to pull them up & then down out of my crotch. I can\'t imagine how it would be when they were washed if it would be twisted more. They also are just a weird fit, like they fit beautifully in the butt, but the elastic waist band is tighter, and not the wide tight like tummy control, like the kind that gives you muffin top. They\'re also short, as in I have 4 inches of ankle showing above my sock and I\'m not tall, I\'m short. The material is fine and the stretch is nice, it\'s just not a good fit for my shape, hour glassy with some extra mom belly, I\'m 5\'4"" & 160lbs for reference, I got a sz large as was suggested.

I always take a chance on bottoms, because my waist measurement is usually at least a couple of inches larger than what‚Äôs recommended on size charts. That was the case with these sweatpants, but because the hip measurement was more than accommodating and the waistband was fully elasticized, I took a chance that a small would work. The pink color is accurately represented in the photos. Thankfully, the small does fit, but the description states the sweatpants are ‚Äúcasual baggy‚Äù, and I don‚Äôt feel they‚Äôre baggy anywhere. I like the stitched seams down the front of the legs, and think it makes the sweats a little more dressy than a standard pair of sweatpants. The pockets are nice and deep and will easily accommodate my iPhone 12 Pro, as well as other small necessities. The waistband doesn‚Äôt have a drawstring, but is elasticized all around, and isn‚Äôt overly tight. There‚Äôs also elastic at the hem, which again fits comfortably. I‚Äôm truly appreciative of the length of these‚Ä¶they‚Äôre actually long enough to reach my ankles. The knit fabric is stretchy and soft to touch on the outside. The inside has more of a terry look and feel to it. The quality of the Caracilia high-waisted sweatpants is very good. There are no notable construction issues, and the seams are all finished cleanly inside. The topstitching through the pants is neat and even with no missed stitches. Prior to wearing these the first time, I washed them per instructions and then hung them to air dry (I air dry almost all of my clothes). They laundered without problems‚Ä¶no shrinking, fading or pilling. Overall, I am very pleased with these and would recommend them, with the understanding that they aren‚Äôt a true baggy fit. Relaxed maybe, but not baggy.For reference, my measurements are:Height - 5‚Äô4‚ÄùBust - 35‚ÄùWaist - 30‚ÄùArm length - 22.5‚ÄùShoulder width - 15‚ÄùWeight - 120#Inseam - 31‚Äù', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 27, 2023', 'is_verified': False}]"

Sometimes I\'ll receive a pair and the leg length will be shorter than usual. So the consistency of the product can fluctuate. This is rare though, usually they fit the same. I recently ordered the camo color pattern in Large and it fits the same around the waist but the length is definitely shorter than the other size Larges I have. Now that I own multiples of these I\'ll be able to detect right away when I receive a short one and make a return. However, if you\'re buying your first pair and receive one that seems shorter, it may be hard to tell.As I said before I\'m 5\'10"" and 150LBS and the Large fits perfect and the length of the legs goes down below my ankle so that the pant legs rest on my shoes and my socks are hidden. When I perform a squat there is enough stretch and length to the pants that they don\'t ride up above my ankles either. That is, except on the camo model that has a shorter leg length.

Amazon, you\'re asking the wrong questions!]Fabric is a densely woven poly. The splatter print is exactly as pictured. Ankle cuffs fit well and the amount of roominess in the legs is appropriate for the amount of stretch in the fabric... though at times they feel just a wee bit too big. So, what am I really complaining about? The waistband SUCKS! Why? It\'s a 2"" band of elastic that\'s encased in the garment fabric along with the pretty-standard, flat, trainer-shoe lace. The problem? The elastic is not adequately anchored inside the waistband of the pants. Whereas most companies will stitch the elastic along the entire waistband, UNIFACO does not. Additionally, the drawstring somehow winds around the elastic, which flips and flops different directions every time you adjust your pants. But the question you should be asking: WHY MUST I KEEP ADJUSTING MY PANTS? Since the fabric is so smooth, and since the waistband is encased, and since there is nothing there to grip the skin on the inside of the waistband of the pants, I find myself tugging at my pants every few minutes while I\'m at work. (I\'m a bartender, and even on a slow night I don\'t have time for this nonsense!) HOW CAN THE MANUFACTURER FIX THIS PROBLEM? Silicone grips on the inside of the waistband... coupled with a narrower elastic band and a more robust, barrel-weave drawcord.If you\'re in the sagger subculture, then these pants are likely for you.But if you seriously don\'t want to be compensating for the fact that your pants are constantly falling down, you might want to look elsewhere. @UNIFACO: Add some silicone grips to the circumference of the inside waistband! Golf pants--GOLF PANTS, FFS!--even have this.

They are super lightweight and offer total freedom of movement.I ordered XL because that\'s the size I always get. These are just a tad too long/large. BUT...although 95% polyester, I\'m certain previous pairs I\'ve bought were also this over size, and that with washing and especially normal heat drying, they DO shrink, just a bit, and just enough. I will be hot wash and hot drying them this week to see if they do shrink just a bit, if I do not report back, assume they did. For the record, I almost always cold wash, and heat dry for about 50 mins.Really great pants. Awesome for summer, but I do wear them year-round. So comfortable, so lightweight, they even seem to repel spills readily.

I received this pair yesterday and here are my thoughts:Pro:1. Color options are virtuously infinite and price point is excellent. I ordered the khaki, but was going to consider other colors if the fit was right.2. Fabric is lightweight, but opaque, doesn\'t show panty lines, very stretchy, nice drape and soft to the touch, just like the Athleta joggers.3. Lots of pockets: slant (not bulky) pockets in the front, one zippered pocket over the lumbar spine (for keys or a very tiny pet maybe? too shallow for a phone).4. Length works for me. I am 5\'2"", the bottom sags some which is totally fine with me, even gives it a bit of a cool vibe. This pant should easily work for average height women, lengthwise.(Only one) Con:1. The waist is a tad tight. I ordered a medium which is what Amazon recommended and, while the fabric is overall very stretchy, the very top of the pants where it falls on the waist has a double seam on the inside which gives that area much less give. Picture of waist unstretched is attached. I don\'t think I\'d exchange it for a large, that would probably be too big.In all, I\'ve decided to keep these and see if the waist thing becomes a non-issue later.For reference, my natural waist is 30 inches and I wear a size 6 in Athleta joggers.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 21, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars One of my best purchases by far', 'author': 'Kathleen Barron', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'These pants look amazing.

The waistband and cuffs have just the right amount of elasticity, ensuring a snug but comfortable fit. The zippers on the ankles are great for changing without needing to take off your shoes.Overall, I would recommend the BROKIG Mens Zip Joggers Pants to anyone looking for a comfortable and stylish pair of pants for workouts or casual wear.

Sometimes I\'ll receive a pair and the leg length will be shorter than usual. So the consistency of the product can fluctuate. This is rare though, usually they fit the same. I recently ordered the camo color pattern in Large and it fits the same around the waist but the length is definitely shorter than the other size Larges I have. Now that I own multiples of these I\'ll be able to detect right away when I receive a short one and make a return. However, if you\'re buying your first pair and receive one that seems shorter, it may be hard to tell.As I said before I\'m 5\'10"" and 150LBS and the Large fits perfect and the length of the legs goes down below my ankle so that the pant legs rest on my shoes and my socks are hidden. When I perform a squat there is enough stretch and length to the pants that they don\'t ride up above my ankles either. That is, except on the camo model that has a shorter leg length. And until I order another camo model I don\'t know if this is due to the color pattern or just a random shorter length pair.These are my favorite pants, I continue to order them.

He\'s 9 years old, tall for his age, and also a beefy/stocky kid. He wears a large in a Nike sweatpant, and an XL in Old Navy brand. I ordered a large in these and they were HUGE. Way too long and way to big around the waist. I am 5\'2"" and 175 pounds and a large fits me, except they were a little snug in the thighs. So if you are a skinny short female who usually wears a women\'s medium, a large in these will fit you well. They are thick, and soft. They feel very warm. I can\'t comment on how they wash...we haven\'t washed them yet. I bought these for halloween so my son could go as DJ Marshmello. I ordered a medium and returned the large. The medium fit him great. Plenty of room. The medium definitely fits like a roomy large.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 20, 2020', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Not true to size, but good quality.', 'author': 'MrsHarrell4', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'These were way too big per normal sizing, but of good quality.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 17, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Fit to size', 'author': 'Cindy Walters', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Perfect fit and very comfortable', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 22, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': ""3.0 out of 5 stars Waist isn't adjustable"", 'author': 'H.

As far as how accurate that it is, only China knows (Made in China).FABRIC: If you are looking for a fleece type of joggers similar to the name brand Nike, Adidas, and etc., this is not the fabric you are looking for. I have a Levi's Men's XX Chino Standard Taper Fit Stretch Pants, and the fabric feels exactly like that. This just means that it feels like khaki pants.LOOK/FIT: I'll keep it simple at the size/fit. These are loose fit, so if you looking for a joggers/tapered type of look these are not for you. I bought the gray ones, and the color look the same to me compared to the picture.QUALITY: (if you care about)-Drawstring is thin. It's just loose woven with what feels like cheap material that easily strings and catch fluff after a couple of washes. The drawstrings are long as well so a lot of room to adjust. Drawstring caps feels like metal.-The fabric for these as khaki pants are phenomenal. It's nearly identical fabric to my Levi's Chinos. But again, as a 'sweatpants' these are terrible fabric for getting a good sweat in (in my opinion).-Loose strings throughout the pants sticking out, not a lot, but noticeable. ( I just cut the loose strings on mine)AFTER WASHBackground (skip this paragraph if you don't care)I skipped the sizing because I expected these to shrink. How'd I know these will shrink? I have bought a lot of clothes throughout the years (on Amazon) from sellers and 90% of them all shrink in some type of way. Knowing this I bought a size up and did an aggressive first wash. Aggressive first wash just means I ran it in hottest water temperature in the washer, and followed by drying it in the hottest setting. After the first wash, the length of the pants shrank about 1.2 inches. Color stayed the same with no fading.Did it shrink? YesHow much? 1.2 inches (Length)Did color fade? NoIn what washer/dryer setting? Hottest setting on bothWhy the 4 star rating?I'm a laborer and I needed a good pair of work pants for half the price of name brand ones like Carhartt. These were around $25-27 when I bought them. The material I didn't care much what kind it was or where it was made. The fabric would be the best quality this item has, as it exceeded my expectations. The fit and look suites how I like my pants loose and baggy. I would say I took out 1 star from the drawstrings and loose strings. What about the shrinkage? I knew how to deal with it before hand, so I don't see a point taking points for something didn't cause me a headache.After a little over a month, I have been using these 3 days a week on my shifts which consist of constantly moving, squatting and kneeling. These pants are holding up really well for how much wear and tear put them through. I wash these about 1-2 times a week depending on how filthy they get. This was worth the price even if lasts me less than 6 months.Was it worth it? (Based on my purpose) YesBuy again?

Wear these when you are going to the disco hoping to get lucky.CONFUSINGThey need to get a consultant to help them with their ad. The most glaring error is that they have two sizing charts and both are different. Using the designation L for instance means nothing in men's pants sizing so a translation chart is necessary but which one is accurate? Another problem is understanding what the various word golf, hiking, track, etc. mean. I don't own any pants that would be suitable for all three activities, each is a specialty activity. I'm actually not sure what these would be most suitable for - I definitely would not take them hiking and they would be way out of place running on a track. They might be okay for golf but they look too dressy for that sport, yet they are not dressy enough to wear to the office. I think they have a real identity problem and a real need for a consultant.YES NO MAYBEDoes it sound like I dislike these? Well no.

The legs are roomy but not huge and the length is around 31"" or maybe a little longer.The material is medium weight and these have pockets - a MUST! They\'re comfortable and don\'t pill after washing. The only issue with the black ones is that they pick up pet hair, dust, and all sorts of little bits as black fabrics usually do. But in general, these sweats are good quality and fit as expected although those with large waists may find that they are a bit tight around the belly. The price fluctuates so keep an eye on these if you\'re interested in buying them. I got the two pack for much less than the $25.00 they are selling for now.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 2, 2020', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Price, quality, fit, all very good. - Updated', 'author': 'JAMed', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I am homebound quite often, so having something that is easy care, comfortable, and warm enough but not hot was priority. Price was a strong consideration as well. Do note ""homebound"". I ordered one pair of these, as often if I try to order several, I end up disappointed and, being homebound, can\'t get stuff sent back in a timely fashion, so end up losing out then having to figure out if the items are even worthy of charity, then hoping I get the stuff in before it piles up. I wish shopping was simpler. In this case it was.Hmm... I was going to write that if you have bigger hips you should order bigger than typical waist size. No need. In reviewing my order, it seems I accidentally ordered a size smaller than what I usually order. They are a bit tight, but comfortable as in how jeans fit. I have been losing weight, if it hasn\'t been showing up when measuring waste, or so it seemed. I am going to have to say... I think these things fit just about exactly as they should, now that I cleared that up. Well, and I actually feel better, even if my waste measurement continues to tell me otherwise about my size. Take it where you can get it.Pajamas to pants, these really impressed me. And, yeah, I am picky. Actually, I would have no other problem, than ego, of wearing these downtown. To me, I have made them into my pajamas and wearing pajamas out just seems... wrong.Thank you, Fruit of the Loom! Wonderful. Encore!Update - After a year and change, I have decided these are the perfect house pants/winter pajamas. They have lasted as well as I could have hoped, and more really, fit like I prefer, wash easily, and wear comfortably. I have decided to buy two more pair. A couple of pair a year will see me in good supply. I\'m mostly waiting to die, but it seems as if I have a longer wait than what the docs freaked out about, so... might as well be comfortable. Just because you could be on the heart transplant list, and they missed it for twenty years, doesn\'t meant you are going to die any time soon.

Why does anyone make sweats without someplace to put your keys and your mp3 player/ iPhone/whatever?These fit great and my wife loves that they don\'t have \'saggy butt syndrome\' like some sweatpants. I got the mediums and the sizing is perfect, by the way. I was a little nervous, but went with the site recommendation. Waist and length are great. My inseam is about a 32"" and these are right on! no dragging on the ground and they reach all the way past my shoes, so if there is a flood, I am not prepared. Will have to roll them up. (that\'s a good thing.) Will definitely revisit and buy again. Shipping was also fast and excellent packaging.11/26/17. It\'s about a year since I bought these and I have worn them many times and washed them many times. They have held up well.

They are functional and will keep you comfortable during casual activities. However, there are some specific design elements that might not align with everyone's preferences, including mine. One notable feature is that the pants gradually taper and become slimmer as they descend from the waist. Personally, I find this aspect less appealing. In my view, the width of the bottom hole should be proportional to the thigh-to-knee width, ensuring a more balanced and comfortable fit. However, with these pants, the ends narrow significantly, almost to half of the original hole size at the thigh, which can be a matter of concern for those who prefer a more relaxed and roomy fit.That said, it's essential to emphasize that while these sweatpants may have certain design quirks, they still serve their primary function quite well. They provide a level of comfort that's acceptable for casual wear and lounging. If you're looking for a budget-friendly option, these sweatpants might be a suitable choice, but I'd hesitate to spend more than 20 dollars on them again, considering the slight discomfort caused by the slimming design. There are alternatives on the market that offer a more balanced fit and design at a similar or slightly higher price point, so it might be worth exploring those options if you prioritize both comfort and style in your loungewear."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 11, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great Product!', 'author': 'Lynn Kostelecky', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'These sweatpants fit great!', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 28, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Run a little small', 'author': 'S.

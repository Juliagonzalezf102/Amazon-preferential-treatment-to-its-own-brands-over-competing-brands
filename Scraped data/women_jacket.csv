I\'ve had a Columbia jacket before, so I knew that it would probably hold up well. I was not disappointed - it\'s a fine jacket!It is that though - a jacket. I\'d say that the best times to use it would be in the late fall to early spring. It is fine for winter and will keep you warm, unless there\'s a lot of cold sharp wind. Where I live, the average ""winter"" temperature is probably in the 30s. The jacket was lacking on a few occasions and I found myself wishing for my heavier coat. However, for basic outdoor use, town trips and general everyday wear, I think it works just fine. It keeps me warm indoors and comfortable outdoors - although I think it is better suited for cool days rather than cold ones. For an idea of how warm you\'ll be - think ""heavy sweatshirt.""Some reviews stated that it had issues with static. I\'m no fan of static, so that bothered me a little. It does have some, but it stays in the jacket. When you take the jacket off, off goes the static (for the most part). But really, what could be expected? It is fleece. Fleece just does that sometimes.As to the fit - it probably runs a little small. I wear a medium in tees and a M to L in most other shirts. I ordered a large in the jacket, and it fits fine with some extra room to boot, but not enough that it\'s sloppy looking.Overall, it\'s very nice, and I\'m quite happy with it!', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States March 5, 2013', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Really Nice', 'author': 'Fleming Island Reviewer', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I took a gamble on buying this top, and I am glad I did!

This jacket is the lightest, first layer, replacing a Helly Hansen jacket that lasted almost 20 years! In terms of weight, it's a perfect light layer and it's very comfortable.I docked it one star, though, because of the pockets. To be fair, I carry a lot of stuff in my pockets: keys (with pepper spray), mini wallet, phone, poop bags, and treat bag. But it all fit in the HH jacket without a problem.The HH jacket was a medium (this is a large) and fit much more snugly. The pockets in the HH jacket, however, could hold so much more, even with less expandable space. The difference is the HH jacket pocket began at the side seam (running down from under the armpit), so the pocket depth was effectively from the side seam to the zipper. In this Columbia jacket, there's a princess seam (curved seam that makes the jacket more fitted at the waist, running about halfway between the side seam and the zipper), which is where the pocket starts. It cuts the depth down by almost half. While everything technically fits in the pockets, I need to zip them to keep stuff from falling out, which I rarely did with the HH jacket.2 other minor quibbles, not worth docking stars: I'd love a breast pocket, where I'd keep my mini wallet and poop bags. I'd also love a hanging loop - a little loop of fabric next to the label at the neckline used to hang the jacket on a hook.

I get compliments wherever I go. If it\'s a little chilly outside, I just wear a light hoody underneath my jacket and the combination keeps me very warm because of the type of material that the jacket is made from. It\'s a perfect windbreaker and very well made. I have had this jacket for a long time and washed it multiple times, and it still has held up. No seam splitting, no pocket tearing, no issues at all. It\'s a high quality jacket that I would recommend to anyone. Both my daughter and I really like this product. Note: to keep it water resistant, I wash it in a regular washer cycle, but I don\'t put it in the dryer. I just put it on a hanger and hang it on my shower curtain.

The sherpa-style warm lining has not come off on my clothes. Also I am able to slip it off and on over my Columbia and other brands of zippered fleece jackets with no problems. It goes on and off smoothly without any tugging or issues. I love the pockets and I especially love the sleeves and the cuff part at the wrist. The hood is great and doesn't come down over my face. I washed them both in cold and dried on low in the dryer and there were no issues. They are soft and warm and really just great jackets. I bought the ones that says they are navy with pink flowers, but to me is looks more like black or maybe a very dark navy with fall or autumn leaves or something... whatever it is, it's super cute! :) It's nice to have a jacket that isn't boring basic black like all my other ones but also isn't a bright bold color.

I like that the sleeves don’t have the fuzzy lining - it is a more slick fabric which makes it so much easier to put on and take off the jacket while wearing long sleeve shirts. I also appreciated the cuff at the end of the sleeve which helped keep the warmth in the sleeves. The jacket definitely doesn’t pack down like a less bulky down jacket, but it is light enough that I just wound it through the bungee cords on my backpack to carry it if I wasn’t wearing it. Sizing seems to be spot on. XL is what I normally wear and the XL fit perfectly. I ordered the XXL to try on too and it definitely looked baggy and less cute/fitted.

I live in Texas, so this would only be worn at most a month out of the year.It came in a vacuumed sealed bag with no tag, which I thought was odd. I laid it flat to see if the coat’s filling would evenly distribute, and was surprised to see how warm and full the jacket got when I tried it on a few hours later.Pro’s: Feels thick and warm, filler distributed evenly throughout, deep pockets, able to cinch the waist if needed.Con’s: Measurements are off; I have a short torso and short extremities, and I am always an XS or S (5’1 118lbs). The sleeve lengths didn’t even touch my wrists, so that was disappointing as it is useless in the fact that I needed this for winter weather. For a cropped jacket, it is cute, but because I received it with no tag attached, and once I tried it on I saw many loose threads, the zippers were all chipped (I got the black jacket, and it has black zippers showing some wear of the silver zipper that was painted) I know there’s a reason why so many brands have the same stock image.Bottom line it’s cute, feels warm, but this coat has so many different brands at different price points, and because the stock image is the same on all the brands, I believe I got one that was made incorrectly and was either worn or the zippers used were not new, and the company just wanted to make sure they sold all of their inventory. Just spend the extra $20 and get a coat where you get what you see in the photo and the measurements are correct.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 16, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Warm & comfy!', 'author': 'Cheri B', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Looks great, warm, stylish & comfortable. it does run large, but that is in style - I typically wear a small (5\'6"", 125 lbs) If they had an extra small I would have ordered that size.

I tried THIS hoodie in a size small and turns out it fits perfect! The body length goes to mid-butt like I like (I hate the short, boxy look of some tops these days), the sleeve length is not too short or too long, and the width has more of a straight cut rather than a wide/roomy cut - so it’s flattering on a woman’s figure. The hood actually covers your head with a little to spare so there’s no tugging on the back seam. And the fabric is high-quality, dense, and just the right thickness for a legit sweatshirt. It kept me warm while at the coast in November with just one layer underneath. The pockets are deep enough to keep your smart phone in with no fear of falling out. It has those thumb cut-outs which I kinda like and no draw-string for the hood which I’m fine with because the zipper goes all the way up to your chin.

The medium also had a care tag and an extra button inside, and the small did not. The quality control on both was rather poor. For example, none of the button holes are properly sewn and will likely fray at some point. The medium also had a small tiny hole under the armpit after one wash on delicate. The medium care tag says it can be washed on gentle and dried in the dryer. With the added thickness of the pockets, I don’t think it would dry very well completely line drying. Despite all its flaws, I decided to keep the medium with the pockets because the colors/ pattern were awesome. I still love the look enough to repair it. If you decide to purchase this item, keep in mind that you may or may not receive side pockets as I’ve read other reviews where the small actually had side pockets (whereas in my case it was the medium with side pockets). Also keep in mind that you may have to do a little bit of sewing on your own or take it to professional to fix button holes, etc..

I first found this hoodie last winter so I've had time to wear, wash/dry and wear again many times. I can say with surety there is no shrinkage, no pilling, and the color has stayed the same. The fleece is still soft and keeps my warm. The elastic around the bottom and wrists have not stretched out. I regularly wear it around the house and don't have to hike my heat up as high to stay warm. And yes, I do get cold easily. I wear them under my lighter coats when I go out to run errands but don't want to wear the heavy bulky coat; and I stay very warm. I actually can't wear this hoodie under my heavier coat because I will be too warm.It will arrive shrink wrapped because it's so bulky, so expect it to be very wrinkled. I found that washing then drying it removed most of the wrinkles. There may be a few stubborn ones left over but after the second wash/dry all the wrinkles were totally gone. And I don't have to use the high heat setting in the dryer. Higher heat may dry in a little faster timeframe, but low heat works just fine.The only con I have is that the outer shell shows stains easily. Since I wear it around the house, I often cook while wearing them. I suspect it's oil splatters that get on it. Or it could be oil from lotion. I honestly am not sure what the spots are.

This jacket has become my go-to outerwear for chilly days, and it offers a good balance of comfort and style.The fuzzy sherpa material is incredibly soft and warm, making it perfect for keeping cozy during the colder months. The long sleeves provide extra coverage, and the button-up design allows for versatile styling options. I appreciate the attention to detail in the craftsmanship, and the off-white color is both elegant and easy to pair with various outfits.The addition of pockets is a practical touch that I find very useful. They are deep enough to hold essentials like my phone and keys, which is convenient when I want to step out quickly without carrying a purse. The jacket is well-sized, and the Medium fits me comfortably without feeling too tight or overly loose.One aspect that could be improved is the thickness of the material. While it's warm enough for most winter days, I wouldn't rely on it for extremely cold weather without additional layers. However, for a stylish and cozy everyday jacket, it serves its purpose well.The overall construction appears to be durable, and the stitching is well done. The jacket has held up nicely through a few washes, and I haven't noticed any significant pilling or wear. It seems like a good investment for a trendy winter piece.In conclusion, the PRETTYGARDEN Women's Fleece Winter Jacket is a stylish and comfortable addition to my winter wardrobe.

From North Dakota', 'author': 'Nikole Wilson', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'First off, I live in North Dakota so if you live in a truly cold area read this!I ordered this coat on Black Friday, I’ve gained some weight and my under armour coat was getting too uncomfortable for me to handle and I couldn’t layer under it without making it far worse so I ordered up to a medium. When this one arrived and I took it out of the box.. I’ll be honest I instantly feared I’d made a huge mistake, it’s so incredibly light weight I didn’t think it would be able to handle 20 degrees. However, I couldn’t have been more wrong.This coat is 100% sufficient on its own down to 0 and might even be good below that, but I always wear a light hoodie under it for subzero temps to be safe as I have a 20 minute drive to work. It’s gotten down to -20 so far and I have not had any issues with it. I spend two 30 minute breaks sitting in my car at work without the vehicle on so I’m not getting heat and I’ve been totally warm every time without fail.One thing I love about this coat that my under armour doesn’t have is the material over the entire length of the zipper, when it’s fully zipped the top rests at my lips and in my other coat that bothered me because I had freezing metal touching my face but not with this one. I also like that the hood is lined with faux fur, my under armour only has a shell hood and is not warm at all it only serves to block wind and rain.Another feature I love is the material that covers your hands and has the thumb holes (no idea what these are called) when you put the coat on your hand slides right into it without needing to fight with it or adjust it. It also gives ample room on top of this layer and under the cuffs for any size gloves to fit.The only reason that I’m giving this 4 out of 5 stars is the pockets, there’s not enough for me and it’s missing two interior pockets that my under armour has. There’s still the two main ones for your hands and one interior chest pocket large enough for any phone or wallet, but I’m all about pockets and it just doesn’t have as many as I would like. I refuse to carry a purse so I need as many as I can get lol.Overall, this coat is absolutely wonderful, it’s perfectly warm for subzero temps but also comfortable to wear during a quick run into a store. I don’t think it could possibly be more comfortable, it’s like wearing a soft & warm cloud haha it truly lives up to its name.If you live in an area with harsh winters, this is your coat.

I would have gone with the ice blue if the colors came across on the screen better is all. Also the front pockets are a bit inconvenient for hands, as they aren\'t angled, but very good for keeping a pair of gloves in, very deep, can fit a larger cell phone or a wallet easy as well.

This jacket has become my go-to outerwear for chilly days, and it offers a good balance of comfort and style.The fuzzy sherpa material is incredibly soft and warm, making it perfect for keeping cozy during the colder months. The long sleeves provide extra coverage, and the button-up design allows for versatile styling options. I appreciate the attention to detail in the craftsmanship, and the off-white color is both elegant and easy to pair with various outfits.The addition of pockets is a practical touch that I find very useful. They are deep enough to hold essentials like my phone and keys, which is convenient when I want to step out quickly without carrying a purse. The jacket is well-sized, and the Medium fits me comfortably without feeling too tight or overly loose.One aspect that could be improved is the thickness of the material. While it's warm enough for most winter days, I wouldn't rely on it for extremely cold weather without additional layers. However, for a stylish and cozy everyday jacket, it serves its purpose well.The overall construction appears to be durable, and the stitching is well done. The jacket has held up nicely through a few washes, and I haven't noticed any significant pilling or wear. It seems like a good investment for a trendy winter piece.In conclusion, the PRETTYGARDEN Women's Fleece Winter Jacket is a stylish and comfortable addition to my winter wardrobe.

They slightly cover your gloves, totally blocking the wind. Additionally, with the X-Large you can wear your bulkiest hoodie and still button the coat. Or, you can leave it unbuttoned and just rap the extra cloth to your left, having more warmth in your front. Or, let it hang loose when you’re shopping in warm stores. This is my very favorite coat and the pink is such a happy color! Someone else with an X-Large said she would move the 2 buttons over.

First, I bought the black moto, and it was pretty much exactly like the one I had before: it really feels like leather and is a nice medium weight. The arm length is great for me, but I have to kinda ""suck in"" to zip it up (I have long arms, and am 5\'9""/175 - bought size L), but that\'s ok since I bought it more for fashion than as an actual jacket to keep me warm outside and will probably never zip it up anyway.It was so good, I bought another in the rust red, this one styled like a regular motorcycle jacket, BUT the snaps on the points of the lapels that hold them onto the chest of the jacket were missing, although they are shown in the product image. The corresponding snaps do exist on the body of the jacket, so I exchanged for another one thinking it was just a one-off defect, but the second one was also missing the lapel snaps. As a result, the lapels hang/stick out at a 90 degree angle from the jacket rather than laying flat and that\'s not a great look. I then sent it back and got the same moto style in the dark red and that is great/looks good/fits well as the first black one. That\'s fine, since I think moto jackets suit me better anyway, but be aware that product images may not match what you get exactly.

It is lightweight which will be perfect for Spring, cool summer nights and Fall. I live in CT. I need to test it for rain repellency. It definitely doesn't appear it will work for a downpour but if so, that's fine. Reviews said size up 1-2 sizes, so I was afraid this would be too small. It's plenty big. I carry all my weight in my middle and chest and find this very generously cut in the middle. But I guess it's because it's a straight cut jacket. I have narrow hips and can see how the cut might not work as well for a pear shape because it'd be loose in the waist and tight across the hip. For reference, I wear 18-20 in pants and 2x-3x in tops. The arm sleeves are very long on me which I was a little disappointed about. But the wrists can be tightened w. velcro which helps. I love the longer length.

It really is going to depend on HOW you want it to fit and what look you are going for. If you get free shipping and/or are able to order a couple sizes at once and return the one you don\'t want, this process will go much more smoothly for you. At the time of this review (June 2019) the jacket is Prime, and it\'s marked waaay down (turns out most people aren\'t buying a denim jacket during summer). So I decided it was time to reunite with the fave jacket of my youth. A jacket I wore into the ground that served me well especially with those lovely inside pockets that hide what teenagers want to hide, but that these days allow a girl to have her phone on her person and not in her back pocket or purse...Side note: Retailers of the world please give us POCKETS! Not every voluptuous woman thinks the solution to society\'s discomfort with our bodies is to remove the pockets!!! Thank you Levi\'s for understanding!!!! [/soap box]The jacket I received is authentic. It has added spandex for a little stretch. The first one I ordered was a 2X. I had read the reviews stating to order up for a few years and I followed orders. The 2X was lovely, but as usual the arms were too long (I\'m 5\'6"") and it just felt baggy on me. If I were going to use it for layering in cold weather, I\'d have kept the 2X. But I wanted a spring/autumn jacket to throw over a tee or a THIN hoodie. I\'ll go back for the barn/cargo jacket for cold weather. I don\'t care too much if this one buttons because I won\'t wear it that way. I mean... yes, I CAN button it if I get caught in a wind storm, but that won\'t be the norm.So I cannot say definitively ""order up,"" because it\'s going to depend on how you plan to style it. I will say that I wear a 38DDD, have a belly, and the 1X lays naturally with about 2-3"" between the buttons, and I can button if I must. The Lola color is my jam, just dark enough but also just faded enough, but I mean any of them will be nice. I have front pockets which are missing from so many designers lately, and I have that warm nostalgia I am seeking in the name brand. So many memories. So many.I have a collection of jackets from my fave retailer for curvynistas like myself, Torrid, and I would say this jacket is comparable (the 1X Levis fits like a Torrid 1 and a 2X is a Torrid 2). Plus it\'s a slim fit. Think of this jacket as a ""Juniors Plus,"" if that helps. And good luck styling your beautiful self!

Please note that the 3 trucker jackets DO NOT COME WITH A HOODIE. I was simply making sure I could layer a hoodie underneath the denim jackets as this is how I like to wear them. All 3 Large sized jackets passed my hoodie test and Large felt like an accurate size recommendation to the style of each jacket. The sleeve length was long and perfect for me. If you’re looking for a more “form fitting” jacket, order the original trucker in your normal size (it does have stretch if you’re between sizes), order the Ex-Boyfriend a size smaller (no stretch.. watch out for arm length though), and skip the Baggy trucker altogether or try ordering it two sizes smaller (no stretch.. watch out for arm length changes ordering small sizes). My measurements: Height 5’8” - Weight 155lbs - Shoulder to Shoulder 17"" - Bust 38"" - Waist 28” - Hips 40"". All of the Levi’s denim trucker jackets have inside “pockets” which is a feature I have always loved from Levi’s denim jackets. If you notice from the photos, each jacket is about 2” longer than the next. The Original trucker jacket being the shortest length and darkest wash; pictured in the first photo, all the way to the left (top & bottom) of the second photo and all the way to the right in the third photo. It is meant to be roomy but more form fitting, while the other two styles are meant to be baggy. I was still able to layer the Original trucker over my hoodie comfortably in my recommended size. While the Original trucker fit nicely and probably would look best over dresses out of the 3, I chose the Ex-Boyfriend because I already own a form fitting denim jacket and wanted something different. I liked the Original trucker the least because it was so dark, had all black buttons, and looked too new and clean. This sounds weird, but all my black jeans are all faded, so I preferred the faded washes on the other two black trucker jackets. The Baggy Trucker and Ex-Boyfriend trucker also have no stretch and have contrasting brownish brass buttons which felt more vintage. Notice the Ex-Boyfriend jacket has buttons on the right “men’s side” while both the Original Trucker and Baggy Trucker have buttons on the left “women’s side”.

I received it today.First off the color (lily red) is beautiful. I am not a fan of the Velcro ""fasteners"" on the front - might as well call them lint collectors and they tend to snag things. The fabric seems very soft and the jacket appears to be well made. There is a tag with a price of $100 on it. I purchased this jacket in red in size 2X and 3X for under $35 - what a deal! The hood is as someone else commented fairly small (it doesn\'t extend out very far), but I guess I\'ll just have to test it out. At least I\'ll be able to see when I am wearing it! There is a cinch elastic at the bottom, but it\'s just on one side and when I cinched the jacket, it just looked awkward. Size-wise, I wear a 2X in jackets and I actually have a 2X on the way so I will be able to compare. The jacket is very generously sized in the arms and shoulders - the hips not so much. It seems to be a fairly straight cut jacket.I will update this once I have the 2X to compare. As far as being versatile, this jacket might just fit the bill. It could be also used as a parka over a fleece jacket for colder weather.Update: I now have the 2X and the 3X. There is a significant difference in the sizing and quite honestly that’s a good thing. I’ve decided to keep both because the jackets will serve different purposes. The 3X is fairly long (27.75 inches in front measuring from collarbone - the 2X is one inch shorter) and there’s plenty of room for me to wear layers underneath. I just returned from a breezy walk on the beach in high 30’s/low 40’s temperatures and it was absolutely perfect paired with wind pants and fleece underneath. It definitely kept out the cold wind! You could probably use this as a ski parka with the right layers underneath. The size 3X jacket weighs 447 grams - just under a pound. It doesn’t appear to be “self-packable”, but fits nicely in a plastic one gallon Ziplock bag.The 2X will be better as a rain jacket and for warmer weather. It’s shorter in length and looks more tailored because it is more form-fitting. It’s a tad snug in the hips and I consider this a minor design flaw because otherwise the jacket is true to size in all respects. There are mesh-lined zippered pockets (6 in zipper) on each side of the jacket. I realized that they were mesh when the sand from the shells that I’d collected fell from the pocket. I’m not as excited about mesh pockets. I worry that they could get torn or catch on things over time - same with the mesh lining of the jacket.So far, the jacket has offered excellent wind protection. I’ll have to see how it does in rainy weather.

When that order arrived, I really didn't think I'd get much use out of them. I was wrong. It was still winter, and I put them in a closet and almost forgot about them. Then on a cooler summer day, I was cold, but it wasn't warm enough for my normal fleece sweatshirts. Then I remembered these buried in my closet and pulled one out. It was perfect! I was warm, but not overheated.I started to wear them when we went out to eat. I'm always cold in diners and restaurants, but my fleece sweatshirts are usually too much; I'm too warm with them on and too cool with them off, so I wind up draping them over my shoulders, and I'm constantly having to reposition them because they slip down. These lightweight sweatshirts are just perfect in a cold restaurant.I had originally purchased only 2 of these, but after using them all summer long, I bought 4 more. Now with the cooler weather moving in, I'm wearing these around the house, and when I go outside, I put one of my fleece sweatshirts on over them. I have a lot of fleece sweatshirts and wear only a couple of them because my skin is very sensitive and I can't wear any scratchy material against my skin. After numerous washings, the once soft lining of my heavy fleece sweatshirts gets stiff and scratchy, and for me, very uncomfortable. So basically out of about 4 dozen fleece sweatshirts, I only wear a few of the newest ones that are still kind of soft. I've found that I can wear one of these lightweight sweatshirts under my heavy fleece ones, and I'm comfortable because these sweatshirts are just so soft. With using these as liners, I can now go back to using my entire collection of sweatshirts comfortably.As for fit, I always buy any kind of outerwear in a larger size than I actually wear. I do this so I can layer different articles of clothing, depending on how cold I am. I wear an XL, but buy sweatshirts and jackets in either 2X or 3X. The lightweight sweatshirts I purchased are 3X, but I feel they fit more like a 2X, so I would recommend sizing up a bit.All in all I really love these hoodies! If you are like me and are cold most of the time, these will give you the little bit of warmth that you need for those in-between conditions where you're cold, but a fleece sweatshirt is too warm.

I’m not wide; I’m slender. There is no female shaping to it at all. It’s a straight line down from under the armpits. I have sewing skills and can sew in the sides a bit to make it more flattering. I like the length on my 5’7” frame. The arms are a perfect length on me.-Material: The label says it’s 95% cotton and 5% spandex. Made in China. It’s thin, but not see-through. It’s soft and super stretchy in all directions. I could have sized down; however, then the hoodie would have been too tight across my shoulders and under my arms.-Pockets: Great for hands, but because the opening is large and low, any items you put in might fall out.-Washing: I machine-washed mine in cold water and let them hang to dry because I don’t want them to shrink (because clothing tends to shrink in length but not in width where I’d actually like it to shrink).-Lint: Big problem for the black hoodie. It seems to attract every piece of lint that comes near it. The lint sticks to the material and has to be individually picked off (or use a roller or tape). I find that annoying. Best not to wash it with anything that might release lint, like socks or towels. Lint is not a problem with the denim blue hoodie.The price ($15.99) is good.

Takes some work to get the wrinkles out.', 'author': 'circusdaze', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'I almost love this jacket, though a couple of things get in the way of true bliss.It arrived carefully folded and protected by tissue paper, but being faux leather, it still wrinkled badly. Some wrinkles were so deep I was afraid the fabric was permanently damaged. After doing some online research, I cautiously approached it with a steamer. It took me about 25 minutes and half a gallon of water to make the coat look presentable, heating it with steam and then pressing wrinkles out with my fingers as the fabric cooled. Some fold marks remain, but they aren\'t too noticeable. The jacket went from looking like cheap plastic to something resembling leather. It\'s a good fake, not too shiny, but thin.The jacket is described as a ""moto jacket,"" but it\'s more of a blazer-style coat. It\'s boxy and oversized, and despite the princess seams, it drapes rather than skimming the body. Usually, I consider this a good thing because I have some curves to hide around the waist, but I don\'t like how the thin fabric drapes over my chest, creating several folds. There are also more folds in the sleeves than I like.The fit is as expected. I ordered my normal size – large – and it was oversized, as advertised. It was a bit snug in the arms but good everywhere else over a bulky sweater, and nicely oversized when worn over a tee. I can button it over a sweater, but I prefer it open. The sleeves are a little too long for me, but that\'s a consistent problem for me with coats.The construction is very good. The topstitching is straight and consistent, and the buttonholes are perfect. There\'s an extra button included, but the ones on the coat are firmly anchored, so I don\'t think I\'ll need it. The jacket is fully lined, and there\'s a gusset in the upper back of the lining. The large front pockets have flaps that can be tucked in cleanly.There was only the faintest whiff of a chemical smell when I opened the package. I imagine all the steam I used probably helped get rid of any residual odors. It\'s nice to know that if the coat ever needs washing, it can be hand-laundered in cold water.I think I\'ll get some good use out of this jacket in spring and fall, and maybe even in some light rain showers.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 10, 2023', 'is_verified': False}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Looks Just As Advertised', 'author': 'barbara prestia', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Exactly As Advertised!!!Love It!

I always have a very hard time finding jackets. I am tall and have long arms. Most jackets fit like a belly shirt with 3/4 sleeves. Not this one! The jacket sits right at my hips which is perfect and the sleeves actually come down to my wrists! It’s relatively warm. I usually wear a hoodie anyways, so with one hoodie and the jacket, I’m comfortable to about 30 degrees. If I later two sweatshirts, I can stand a smidge colder. But that’s perfect because that’s why I bought it. I’ve got my big thick coat for when it’s really cold. This jacket is also very lightweight and can be stuffed into the little bag that comes with it, so if you are out and need to take it off, you don’t have to schlep a big bulky coat. It’s also pretty decent with being water resistant. It’s NOT a rain coat, so if you wear it in a downpour, you will still get soaked. But for a day when it’s drizzly, it does a good job keeping me dry. The hood fits really well and actually stays put too. One other thing, I like the material.

While I wish it fit into the bag, it isn’t hard to fold down and roll to fit into a suitcase or backpack. With it being quite light, it is definitely a jacket I won’t mind toting on trips. I typically wear an XL and it seemed true to size, but I opted to keep the XXL just so I had extra room underneath for bulkier clothing like sweaters. If you don’t plan to wear anything thick underneath, order your normal size.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States November 4, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Amazon Essentials puffy jack works well here in Florida in the winter', 'author': 'JBF', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I purchased the Amazon essentials puffy jacket with hood thinking ""How good can it be for that price?""

It needs to be big enough to add layers underneath and small enough to fit under the outer jacket. I am 5’8, about 140. I have wide shoulders and long arms which usually poses a problem with sizing. I ordered the size Medium. The jacket fits well but it too narrow in the shoulders and the sleeves are too short with arms extended. I understand this jacket is meant for casual use, not mountaineering. Still, I thought I would review some important parts of this jacket to help you make your decision. First, this grey color is a bit silvery but I like it. The jacket looks very nice; not overly puffy and not too flat. The inside of the jacket is lined with similar fabric as the outside - in other words, it does not have a brushed or fabric lining. There are two, deep pockets inside the jacket, along the zipper. They are plenty deep for, phones, keys etc… probably even a 16oz water bottle! There are two zippered pockets outside which are deep enough to put your hands fully into beyond the wrist. The sleeves have a narrow elastic band at the wrist which seems sufficient. They are not adjustable. The hood is large and is not adjustable. This could be an important point for some. When zipped up all of the way, the zipper came to right below my chin. There is no zipper cover or cloth flap to keep the zipper from rubbing on your chin. There is no flap over or behind the zipper which could allow for wind to blow through or freezing of the zipper if exposed to snow/sleet. I don’t know if the zipper is water resistant like the fabric. I like most of the Amazon Basics stuff and this jacket did not disappoint. In this case, I will order a large to see how they compare in the shoulders and sleeves. It looks like a nice jacket for casual use.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 6, 2021', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars packable, longer torso, 400 g jacket, 8 g travel bag, 3 g clip', 'author': 'Geode', 'rating': 4, 'content': ""Amazon added a feature where you can put in your weight and other details and it will recommend a size for you. It recommended between a medium and a large for me. I wanted a snug fit so I got a medium. It did fit snugly like I want it. My weight varies between 130 and 150 pounds and I am now at the higher end of my weight. I am petite, 53, and big chested. I found the torso to be a tiny bit long, but that isn't a big deal for the price. Also my backside is a bit big and the jacket reaches a tiny bit onto it past my hips because of the longer torso. Rolling up the bottom a tiny bit shortens the torso and keeps the jacket off of my backside where it is too tight. I don't really like the color, but I was trying to spend as little as possible on this jacket so I got the cheapest color, which is probably the least desirable.Lots of people have asked about the weight of this jacket and have not gotten an answer. I put the jacket in a box to make it easier to weigh as it kept on coming unfolded, and then I subtracted the weight of the box from the total weight. I got 400 g for the medium jacket, 8 g for the travel bag, and 3 g for the clip making a total of 411 g for the entire set up. You would think that they would advertise the weight but they don't. You can see the shipping weight, but that is the weight of the entire package instead of the weight of the jacket. I will add a bit to the shipping week to make sure there is enough leeway. I have not been able to get it to fit in a travel bag. If you can get it to fit there I would encourage you not to store it in its travel bag because jackets and sleeping bags should not be stored in a compressed state, especially synthetic ones. I have tried really hard and can't do it. I'm not sure if I really need its travel back. I'm not an expert, but I believe it would be fine to put it in a backpack uncompressed and then use the compression straps as necessary. It is a huge like a sleeping bag where it could be helpful to have a stuff sack.I believe that if you are using this jacket as part of a proper layering system, you could be fine down to 20°. Perhaps if you were wearing thermal underwear you would be fine a bit lower.. I was just thinking of having it with a moisture wicking long sleeve shirt well actively moving when making my 20° estimate. Without actively moving I would estimate you would need a light weight pullover fleece to get that same 20° and if you started moving with that set up you could get to 10° perhaps. Perhaps with thermal underwear, the shirt over it, the fleece pullover, and then this jacket you could make it below 0°. It depends a lot on whether you are moving, what else you are wearing, and how cold you get. A lot of people are asking though so I thought I would try to estimate. With a sleeping bag it is a lot easier to get a temperature rating because someone is just sleeping. For something over 50° though, I think it might get too hot and it would be better to have a pullover fleece. I don't get cold that easily though. It would be interesting to see what others think of my estimates.I don't really know The purpose of the clip. The instructions also seem to indicate that you can wash it just the way you would wash any other type of clothing, but water resistant jackets normally need to be washed with a special detergent to maintain their waterproofing properties so I'm a bit confused about that. The only other problem I have with the jacket is that I wish it were a bit more breathable, but most jackets of this style have that problem. If your other clothing is breathable I think it would be fine. If I paid $300 for this jacket I would bump the rating down to three stars, but because I paid $30 for this jacket, the rating is four stars."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2021', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Quality warm coat', 'author': 'Do the Thing', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'I got this coat after being recommended it by a friend.

Could roll it up in it\'s carry bag and stick in a back pack or large purse in museums/theaters. On me it came about 3 "" above knees so helped keep legs warm. No problem sitting at that length.

I could wear it for a lot of different scenarios—not only hiking.The only drawback is that it doesn’t come with a packing bag, nor do either of the pockets have a double zipper for packing. I will say, you CAN stuff the whole coat inside one pocket! You just can’t zip it up. Oh well, not a deal breaker.One more thing: I’m pear-shaped and normally wear S/M but I had to buy a large in the GWII to get it to cover the tops of my hips.

I normally wear an x-small or small in outerwear depending on the fabric. But because it was faux leather I was concerned about the cut under the arms. I was thinking an x-small might be too constrictive and it wouldn\'t allow me to raise my arms comfortably and it might pull too much. But because it was lightweight, I took a chance on the x-small and I am glad I did. It fit me perfectly and it was not uncomfortable.I love this style and the fact that it was short. I am only 5\'2"" and weigh 95 lbs. I bought this jacket to wear with my flared jeans, and I wanted it to make my legs look longer, which it did. If you are a shorter person, cropped jackets look better because they are not so overwhelming and they make you look taller than what you are.The sleeves were a little long, but I like them that way. It doesn\'t look like you outgrew the jacket.The fabric is soft and pliable and not stiff. I have bought several faux leather jackets in the past, but this style, texture and fit was the best I have ever had.It is perfect for the fall weather. I mostly wear denim jackets, but this gives me a dressy alternative. The x-small was just the right size, style and fit for me, because I don\'t intend to wear heavy sweaters under it. So you will have to decide the kind of clothing you will be wearing underneath it to select the size you need.Even though the zipper is slightly off center, I can wear it open (which will be most of the time) without it looking funny and the lapels lay flat.So if you want a lightweight, fashionable and comfortable faux leather jacket that doesn\'t look or feel cheap, I highly recommend this one.

It’s not oppressively warm (for summer time evening) but I was hot haha (didn’t break a sweat tho). During Fall it will be perfect. During Northern California winter, I’ll definitely layer a hoodie or sweater underneath.. It looks fantastic. I got a medium because I do intend to layer it during the cool/cold months but I could have ordered a small to wear it stand alone (while thin/average build, I have bigger arms than my frame would suggest). I’m 5”6 and 127lbs. I have a long torso and shorter legs. I sometimes look goofy in short jackets and tops. I bought this because it seemed just a touch longer than bomber and moto jackets tend to be. It’s perfect. No need to break this in - like I said, it’s soft - it melts into your form immediately. As soon as I put it on - it seemed like I’ve had it for years (in a good way). My friend who I hung out with that night, said, “oooo you got a new leather jacket - smells great!” So yeah, I don’t think people will see this and immediately think fake.

I\'m 5\'8 155lbs, athletic with big boobs. The large was really large everywhere, I don\'t mind the oversized look but it was quite large in the shoulders and the body so I returned it for the medium. The medium fits perfectly with plenty of room for layers. What I like the best about it is that it is super warm and it is long enough to cover my bum in the back. It has a longer back than front.There are tons of pockets including ones on the sleeve for a ski pass. The hood is big enough to fit over my ski helmet which keeps you super warm. My only complaint is that the neck is a little narrow. I can\'t get the hood over my helmet and zip the coat up all the way with a gator on underneath.

But the sleeve cuffs were not the same size, so I had to rip out the seam and sew the larger sleeve to make it narrower to match the other sleeve. The back of the jacket has an odd little “yolk” shaped seam and that causes a little pouching of the fabric. It would have been better to design it with all the seam lines running vertically, so the jacket would drape nicely and not pucker in back at that yolk area. I do like the fact that the jacket zips up around the chin, creating a neck warming area that comes up high. And as I said, I like the long length, and had been looking for a longer fleece jacket, so this fits the bill. So mainly, I’d say that Columbia needs to spruce up their quality control as well as change the seam across the back of the jacket, but otherwise a fairly decent jacket. If they made the seam straight across the back (rather than a curved seam) and situated it at the natural waist of the wearer, that might look better.As far as size, I’d say it runs a tad on the larger side, but not by a lot.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States November 15, 2019', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Awesome', 'author': 'Dian Clavizzao', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Awesome', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 8, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great for colder fall weather.', 'author': 'Traummeri', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I like that the jacket is slightly fitted as well as long enough to keep me warm.

I\'m 5/6"" and carry weight in my torso. I normally wear a medium/large (US women\'s size 12/14). I wanted the jacket to fit comfortably with or without wearing bulky layers. I ordered a large and x-large, and tried both on with a variety of clothing. I found the large fit as close to perfect as I was hoping for. It provided enough room when wearing more bulky layers; however, it was a bit tight, not uncomfortably so, in the upper arm area and I had to unzip the sides to sit comfortably. It was especially comfortable wearing lighter layers (which is all I ended up needing). The x-large felt too big all over. The other concern was the jacket\'s quality, as many pictures showed tears at the seams. I haven\'t owned/warn the jacket long enough to comment on this concern, but will update my review if that changes. I found the jacket (with one or two light layers underneath) kept me plenty warm in temperatures of 30 degrees F, and I was literally sweating when indoors. Interesting side note, while in Canada, I came across five other women wearing the same jacket. Lastly, I bought the jacket during a sale for $95.

The jacket arrived on time and was well-packaged in its own dust cover bag. Initially, I was impressed with the quality of the material and the fabric feels durable yet comfortable.The fit is true to size. The pockets are well-placed and spacious, perfect for my phone, keys, and cold hands. Another feature I love is the adjustable hood, which is large enough to provide excellent protection against wind and rain.The only downside is that the zipper at times can be a bit finicky, requiring a little bit of patience to get it started. However, this is a minor issue compared to the overall functionality and style of the jacket.This is a fantastic value for its price.

And the coat was even better than I'd expected (and getting the nicer version with the faux fur was worth it). All of the materials are very sturdy and the coat is unbelievably warm. It also looks really nice on! It even fits on the bottom without having to utilize the side zippers, which I'd worried about as I am quite curvy there. But the zippers do add more give when you need it--like sitting for a long period. The only negative to this coat so far is the side pocket openings are really small for some reason and a little awkwardly placed; they hold a decent amount, it's just hard to get things in or out while you're wearing the coat. Will be using the front-facing pockets much more.I got a 2x--my normal size and what the measurements recommended--and was fine ... a 3x probably would be good for more room over heavy sweaters, but I think it wouldn't have fit in the shoulders as well based on how the 2x fits. So if you don't mind a little bagginess and/or plan to layer a bit, or want it loose around the bottom, you may want to size up."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 17, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars This coat is AMAZING and truly keeps the extreme cold out', 'author': 'Jjfreshbread', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'This coat is big, cozy, and warm. It’s like wearing a hug. The many features added to adjust for size and fit differences make this coat truly stand out. They made the difference of this coat fitting me when at first i thought it too small. Using the side zips for additional space (or making the coat more snug) and unsnapping the bilateral snaps by the front closure zipper made it work for me. And in colder weather, I re-snap the ones by the front closure zipper that adds a little more toast to its “toastyness”. The numerous pockets are essential for true winter coats. Who wants to carry a bag when it’s super cold outside? Not me, therefore, the pockets become priceless. The added zipper pulls make it very easy to open/close the pockets when one is wearing beefy hand coverings. The pockets for your hands are lined and very warm. The hood is large and beefy and makes it so one can forego a scarf, and sometimes even a hat. I live in Wisconsin and it’s currently 30 degrees below zero with the windchill. This coat is so warm, i would never guess the temp is this low. I’ve worn Lands’ End coats religiously my whole life, that is until i found this coat. It’s a true rival.With all of this praise, i do have some suggestions: add a double-zipper to the open/close front zipper. This is a crucial feature in cold weather environments and almost kept me from buying the coat. One needs the added comfort for sitting in the car, as well as being able to reach your pants pockets without having to unzip the coat completely. Then there’s the great hood, which some of the features that make it great also make it functionally difficult to wear. First, it’s so large and cumbersome that it interferes with your visibility while driving. You either have to take the coat off to drive (which is very cold until the car heats up) or deal with compromised visibility. Therefore, this hood should be removable. One can keep the interior edges and fringe of the hood much cleaner when it’s removable too, which means you can make the coat last longer. Also, since it is so big that you can forego a scarf, with a few added snaps and/or straps, then you could keep the hood from blowing off on windy days. Having to use one less article of clothing is a major plus, and this would be an easy additional feature to add. Actually, all of these suggestions are simple but very crucial to those of us who wear the coat day-in and day-out. A casual wearer might not be bothered as much by these features.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 17, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars very warm and cozy', 'author': 'nicole vizzini', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I was skeptical after reading all of the varied reviews but I am so glad I trusted my gut and bought this jacket.

Amazon made it very easy to replace the jacket for the correct one and it arrived the following day. This time I was sent a medium! Had to return this one again!! and amazon had the replacement sent to me two days later. When the xs small finally came I kept it and reordered the coat in an XXS. I read people were going up a size for layering but this jacket is very wide. As others have mentioned, the zippers along the side allow for a lot of extra room if unzipped and help when sitting and layering. I ended up returning the XS and keeping the XXS because it was still large enough to comfortably layer with long John’s, sweaters, tights and jeans. It’s very comfortable and kept me warm walking all around NYC in snow, wind and damp weather. The hood stayed up and the lining was very warm.

Plus, the yellow shade is so sunny as days get shorter, I get compliments every time I wear it because it cheers people up to see it.

I was bummed, because I'd been sledding and had no issues with it and I've worn it while being tackle-hugged by various ages of kids at work--all without any incident or showing of wear or tear.\xa0I am hoping I can securely repair the zipper this time, but if other\xa0rips appear from predictable wearing of the coat (bending down, etc.), I am really hoping they only happen where I can easily repair it.

I have bought a number of them and just bought three more. These are fleece lined and then sherpa faced on the outside --hence a double thickness of warmth. The snaps work well. The small fit me perfectly, at 5'3 and 120lbs. The colors are pretty much as shown. The snaps are substantial, the webbed hem and cuffs are really perfect and somewhat stretchy (I even fit the sleeve over my cast), and the neck buttons up nice and high for really fiercely cold day. I do have a little trouble getting some of my coats and jackets over these as they are of substantial thickness.THESE JACKETS/FLEECES ARE A LIFESAVER AS THEY HAVE ALLOWED ME TO SUBSTANTIALLY TO LOWER MY HEAT, EVEN ON REALLY COLD DAYS, TO ABOUT 62F. ONLY MY FEET GET COLD. BUT WE HAVE AN OIL FURNACE SO HAVE HAD A SUBSTANTIAL SAVINGS WITH OIL PRICES SO HIGH. IT IS NOT IN MY NATURE TO GIVE RAVE REVIEWS, BUT IN MY OPINION THIS PRODUCT DESERVES 5 STARS+++++.MY ORIGINAL REVIEW: I first bought two for myself to see about the fit and quality. The small fit me perfectly, with the little bit of looseness I like for a turtleneck or tee underneath. I'm 5'3 & 117 lbs. The length is good and the small size hits at my low hip, & the arms are just the right length. (My arms are longer than you'd predict from my size.) Thus, you can expect these to be true to size, & they certainly look MUCH better than they appear on the model. Why did they use those awful photos?The fleece is very thick, does not shed, and is a bit stretchy. I cannot believe how warm, -- oh so warm -- they are. The pockets are substantial; I can carry my big cell phone around in them. Be sure to keep them tucked as intended (from near the side seam & then toward the zipper) or they can make you look a bit thick around the girth -- not a big issue, though, as you simply need to adjust them when first putting the fleece on.The quality is very good. The snaps are substantial and go all the way up & down, allowing ANOTHER fleece to be worn in various styles, such as open, partly open, mostly closed, or turtle neck style. The ribbed front placket, pocket openings, & the cuffs are very nice: thick, well-sewn, & somewhat stretchy. The colors on my phone screen compared to the colors that arrived are very similar.I did not expect these to be as thick & lush as they are, so I do have some trouble fitting them under a few winter coats & jackets. This, however, would not stop me from buying more!I did not expect these to be such a good buy, BUT THEY ARE, so I bought quite a few others in different colors. The quality control & sizing remained the same. No worries about some being too big & others too small.I highly recommend these, especially if you live in cold climes or just like to lounge around in cooler weather in something really comfortable. A big thumbs up on these.UPDATE: I washed a few of these. They wash nicely on a permanent press cycle, and they dried without leaving lots of fluff in the dryer or on other clothing.

And even having been on bed rest for an injury I can still fit my oversized yogalates outfits while getting back in shape.

But, that being said, if you buy the black or midnightNavy, the overall look should be fine and if it’s a bit looser than expected you can still work out and maintain a manicured fitness-garment appearance that you can do other things in. I like a longer line, so I ordered the long. In the jacket it’s fine to go one size up to maintain the relaxed fit.Overall Not a bad item, although the prices could be more competitive.Our grade A Solid C+ or 3.5125Stars"", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States April 8, 2022', 'is_verified': True}]",

I have bought a number of them and just bought three more. These are fleece lined and then sherpa faced on the outside --hence a double thickness of warmth. The snaps work well. The small fit me perfectly, at 5'3 and 120lbs. The colors are pretty much as shown. The snaps are substantial, the webbed hem and cuffs are really perfect and somewhat stretchy (I even fit the sleeve over my cast), and the neck buttons up nice and high for really fiercely cold day. I do have a little trouble getting some of my coats and jackets over these as they are of substantial thickness.THESE JACKETS/FLEECES ARE A LIFESAVER AS THEY HAVE ALLOWED ME TO SUBSTANTIALLY TO LOWER MY HEAT, EVEN ON REALLY COLD DAYS, TO ABOUT 62F. ONLY MY FEET GET COLD. BUT WE HAVE AN OIL FURNACE SO HAVE HAD A SUBSTANTIAL SAVINGS WITH OIL PRICES SO HIGH. IT IS NOT IN MY NATURE TO GIVE RAVE REVIEWS, BUT IN MY OPINION THIS PRODUCT DESERVES 5 STARS+++++.MY ORIGINAL REVIEW: I first bought two for myself to see about the fit and quality. The small fit me perfectly, with the little bit of looseness I like for a turtleneck or tee underneath. I'm 5'3 & 117 lbs. The length is good and the small size hits at my low hip, & the arms are just the right length. (My arms are longer than you'd predict from my size.) Thus, you can expect these to be true to size, & they certainly look MUCH better than they appear on the model. Why did they use those awful photos?The fleece is very thick, does not shed, and is a bit stretchy. I cannot believe how warm, -- oh so warm -- they are. The pockets are substantial; I can carry my big cell phone around in them. Be sure to keep them tucked as intended (from near the side seam & then toward the zipper) or they can make you look a bit thick around the girth -- not a big issue, though, as you simply need to adjust them when first putting the fleece on.The quality is very good. The snaps are substantial and go all the way up & down, allowing ANOTHER fleece to be worn in various styles, such as open, partly open, mostly closed, or turtle neck style. The ribbed front placket, pocket openings, & the cuffs are very nice: thick, well-sewn, & somewhat stretchy. The colors on my phone screen compared to the colors that arrived are very similar.I did not expect these to be as thick & lush as they are, so I do have some trouble fitting them under a few winter coats & jackets. This, however, would not stop me from buying more!I did not expect these to be such a good buy, BUT THEY ARE, so I bought quite a few others in different colors. The quality control & sizing remained the same. No worries about some being too big & others too small.I highly recommend these, especially if you live in cold climes or just like to lounge around in cooler weather in something really comfortable. A big thumbs up on these.UPDATE: I washed a few of these. They wash nicely on a permanent press cycle, and they dried without leaving lots of fluff in the dryer or on other clothing.

I ordered a large based on reviews and it fit perfectly. When I first pulled this jacket out of the box, I was pretty impressed with it for the price. It has a lot of style and I loved the stitching details and look of the black pleather. It looks more expensive than it is. I wasn\'t as impressed when I put the jacket on. Size wise, it fit just fine in length and arms but was definitely made with for someone with a bigger chest size than me (I\'m 34B). It was very wide in that area and left extra material around my armpits that just looked wrong. I couldn\'t have sized down any more though - would have been too tight to zip. Same goes for the bottom of the jacket. It flared out more than I wanted it to, especially in the back, yet the front of the jacket fit well. There were also some stitching mistakes that resulted in bulges along some of the jacket seams, though I doubt anyone would notice it with a casual glance. The main concern I had and what ultimately forced me to return it was the lining of the jacket. It was so loose and uneven inside that it showed behind the zipper when left unzipped. I tried to capture this in the photos below. I thought ironing it might help to eliminate the problem, but there just ended up being too much lining to the jacket that forced it to shift and show, which was unsightly and cheapened the look of the jacket. Perhaps this was just a mistake in this one jacket...not really sure. There is a tag sewn on the outside of the bottom of the jacket on the lower left hand side that says ""Made by Johnny.""

It\'s definitely a rust color and I love that, because I don\'t tend to wear bright colors, but I get so tired of back. This color is perfect and very classy.As for the size, I would suggest sizing up one. I originally bought this in Large (I\'m 5\'4"" and 140 lbs.), which should have fit me according to the size chart. However, when it came in, it was too trim fitting. If all I was going to wear under it was a camisole and never zip it up, it would be fine. But I know I wanted some more room, so I reordered it in Extra Large. When I hold them together, the bigger one is an inch or two wider, but the sleeves are still pretty much the same length. I feel comfortable in the XL, and it still has a trim fit (I would not wear a thick sweater underneath, but a thin sweater or regular shirt/blouse is fine!). I will have to under-cuff the sleeves because they are kind of long. There are zippers at the sleeves, but I am still able to under-cuff them.I absolutely love the style of the ""Rust Red,"" because it has lapels that you can snap to keep them laying correctly. The snaps are good and sturdy. I don\'t care for the zipped-up look, but there is that option as well, for those who want it. I feel like I look like a million bucks wearing this.Finally, what you probably came to the comments to read about: the smell. I\'ve ordered faux leather on Amazon before, and yeah ... a good half has arrived with a strong fishy odor. I am very pleased to report that BOTH packages (sent within days of each other) of this jacket arrived well-wrapped with tissue paper covering all the zippers plus a long piece of tissue paper in the middle (to prevent the zippers from marring the fabric), and neither one had a fish odor at ALL. It may be this style/color, but there is NO unpleasant odor whatsoever, and I was able to put it in my closet right away.Overall, I am super pleased with this jacket. Although it\'s faux leather, it does not look like it.

And even having been on bed rest for an injury I can still fit my oversized yogalates outfits while getting back in shape. SO there is something to say about going for the relaxed slack fit in your fitness attire.Special Notes:Prior to 2010, For a more relaxed exercise YogaLates outfit -fit you can go one size up in the Exersion brandTops and Bottoms from the standard small to a medium.Prior to 2010, For a more relaxed exercise YogaLates outfit -fit you can go one size up in the Gaiam brand Tops and Bottoms from the standard small to a medium.After 2010 In the Champion and C9, you can still get a relaxed fit by going one size up in the tops/jacket from a small to a medium but in the pants for best results you should go two or more sizes up from small to Large and if you are standard tall or taller in the pants for a more relaxed slack yogalates fit that will take you from the gym to lunch-you will need to go to LargeTall or XLargeTall in the pants and medium in the tops/jacket.After 2010 In the GearTek or TekGear, you can get a relaxed fit by going one size up in the tops/jacket from a small to a medium but in the pants for best results you should go two or more sizes up from small to Large and if you are standard tall or taller in the pants for a more relaxed slack yogalates fit that will take you from the gym to lunch-you will need to go to LargeTall or XLargeTall in the pants and medium in the tops/jacket.When Amazon took over the branding permissions from target, I was a bit skeptical as the Target-Instore and Targetdotcom returns policy is very easy and the additional off with the sale offerings really g a long way when maintaining a budget, and Amazon coupons are infrequent at best and also Amazon has no boutique, so you can’t actually try things on before you buy to get an idea of the cut/fit of the style of garment. But, that being said, if you buy the black or midnightNavy, the overall look should be fine and if it’s a bit looser than expected you can still work out and maintain a manicured fitness-garment appearance that you can do other things in. I like a longer line, so I ordered the long. In the jacket it’s fine to go one size up to maintain the relaxed fit.Overall Not a bad item, although the prices could be more competitive.Our grade A Solid C+ or 3.5125Stars"", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States April 8, 2022', 'is_verified': True}]",

It's actually a wonderful coat, but if you want to LOOK like a million bucks, look elsewhere.First the pros: it's warm, it's cozy, it's a very nice color (I purchased the grey/blue color and i really like it). This is the perfect coat for running out quickly to drop the kids to school or to running the dog out in the cold. I have only worn it in mid/upper 40's weather, but I was only wearing a thin t-shirt underneath and I was completely warm. I can't say what it would be like in the elements, but I imagine it wouldn't be your first choice for a snowstorm or heavy rain.Now the cons: the sleeves are a tad on the short side, but I have short arms, so it doesn't bother me, but it would definitely be a problem if you have really long arms. As far as fit, it's not the least bit flattering. Like the opposite of flattering. No shape to it and I'm already not a skinny gal, so it does me no favors in that department, but I don't really care about that with this coat because I love how cozy and comfy it is. If I'm being honest (which I am) it's kind of like a very unsexy bathrobe that you can wear in public.

Also, the sleeve length is too short and I’m petite (5’4”). There’s no banding on the bottom of the sleeves to keep the cold air out and no tie strings to cinch up the hood. The patch pockets in front aren’t lined so your hands get cold unless you wear gloves; they are annoying to use as regular pockets but a great place to put your phone or keys.Overall, I enjoy the simple versatility of this light coat and wear it often in temperatures above 25 F.

I found it in our local farm supply store for $150, and wanted to buy it sooooooo bad, but bought my son a birthday present instead... darn kids! LOL! I came home and looked on Amazon and found it! New it was $129, and I happened to see there was a used one for $89 so I jumped on it! It came perfectly packaged, still had tags on it and was in perfect condition! I have no idea what was used about it, but I sure am happy with this purchase!! As for the coat--it is excellent quality that you would expect from Carhartt! Very nice heavier quality and I know will last forever. I bought the XL, and I am 5:6 and 170lbs, and it fits perfect! Maybe just a titch too big, but otherwise perfect! I wanted it to come down far enough to cover my stomach, which it does, but just barely, that is the only thing I wish was just a few inches longer. It comes down to the bottom of my zipper on my jeans, the back is a bit longer. I love the end of the sleeves, they have a stretchy material with a thumb hole that will prevent cold air from going up the sleeve. This coat has pockets all over! If you need more pockets than this coat has, you either have too much junk, or need to get a huge purse! :) I got the dark wine color, and it is a beautiful plum/dark brownish color, not a bright obnoxiously loud color, but a very pretty earthy plum color. I was torn btw the olive green and the wine, but got the wine and love it! Wish I could afford both! :) I could not be happier with this coat and I highly recommend it!

We did several hikes through southern Ireland and the Isle of Skye in Scotland and this coat kept me warm and dry! It is extremely durable and stood up to wind, rain, mud with no issues. It is not just a liner/shell so it is not extremely light weight. I did not find it heavy or bulky, but compared to my husband's thinner shell style raincoat it definitely took up more packing space. I also LOVED the thumbholes on the wrist part of the sleeve, great for keeping hands/wrists warm in cold climates. As it is not a shell style, it is a warm jacket, but I never felt stuffy or overheated like I have in other rain coats.

Perfect fit, but…', 'author': 'DDV', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I was concerned about the color being too light (because I wanted an actual maroon shade). This fit the bill…definitely a deep maroon. As for the fit, I got a large in the deep wine shade and it’s perfect. I’m 5’ 6”, 150 lb, 42-36-43. I have a wide back and shoulders and was able to bring my arms totally forward with a long sleeve t-shirt underneath. While I haven’t tried it with anything thicker than that, I’m leery that might be too confining for me personally. Someone with a narrower back and shoulders might be fine with a sweater or sweatshirt under it. My arms are average size in circumference and I didn’t feel the sleeves were too tight at all. The sleeves were also plenty long enough which is unusual, because my arms are long. It was not fitted at the waist, which is fine because I need room to be able to fill up all of the pockets (of which there are plenty of deep ones). The 2 upper exterior chest zippered pockets might not provide room for anything but thin or flat objects for a 42” or similar chest, but all others are great. I especially liked the large inside Velcro pocket for enclosing a phone and the double exterior hip pockets. Each side had not only large flap pockets, but behind those were zippered angle pockets just right for putting your hands in while walking without involving the flap covered ones. My torso length is average and the length of the coat was enough to cover my behind for sitting. While the bottom is comfortable for hips up to 43-44 inches, it likely won’t accommodate anything larger. I was able to sit in it completely zipped without it being too tight. The lining of the body is a thin polyester perforated mesh, but the lining of the hood and sleeves are a solid thin polyester—not a fleece at all. While the exterior cloth may provide some protection from significant cold (I have not tested either that or rain yet.), I would likely reserve this coat for a milder temperature outside—no colder than 45 degrees…but clearly individual preference may differ. That said, it is neither too bulky nor too warm for sitting inside an arena with tight seating, which was a key requirement. The only thing I would have preferred to be different is a metal zipper, instead of the plastic one provided. I feel like this coat will last a long time and would prefer the zipper to last as long as the coat. It does, however, have snaps that cover the zipper, so if the zipper should fail, the coat is still usable.

I don’t have a bad thing to say about this coat!Thank you, Carhartt, for making clothes for us ladies!UPDATE: Three years later..I'm still in love with this coat and wear it near daily during the fall, winter and spring months here in Texas. While it is not a winter coat per se, you can layer fleece under it and still use it as a winter coat. Why? Because the outside does a fantastic job blocking not only rain, but wind, too! Surprisingly, Texas gets more wind than anyplace else I've been and it cuts through you. However, wearing this coat? Not a problem! You stay warm and toasty.I've also washed it several times (hung to dry - no dryer) and it's held up just like new.Thinking about buying another color.

Central Europe is like the east coast--humid as well as hot. Perhaps, to be fair, the black color absorbed the heat. Everything else on this jacket is great! I prefer it to other brands because of the metal double zipper (that won't come apart when you bend over) and the multiple pockets. There's one inner pocket that has a hook&loop closure that's annoying, because you no sooner have it open to put something in there and it closes again.

Why? Because I fell in love with a previous version of this one that a friend has, and that earlier version was made out of Gore-Tex and had an amazing luxe sheen without sacrificing functionality. You can take it from the slopes to the fishing boat to the theatre. (We\'re Alaska girls, these things sometimes happen all on the same day.) This fabric is decidedly more ""flat"" and is more in line with expected rougher Carhartt fabrics.This design is great, though, and the construction is impeccable. I ordered a large and it says size 14-16 and I think this is accurate. It is roomy enough for layers without being too bulky. The storm cuffs, numerous roomy pockets, detachable hood, long ""tail"" to cover butt, and a complete lack of velcro (i HATE velcro) make this a winner. It does NOT have any vents, so it won\'t breathe well if you\'re planning to be extremely athletic in it, but it does have a great liner and it\'s a perfect weight—not too heavy, not too light. DIY insulating layers for warmth, which is how I prefer it.I just miss the sheen of the Gore-Tex and though I\'m sure this fabric performs great, it just doesn\'t have the same luxe-feel.

It fits perfectly, and it\'s incredibly warm. It\'s very sturdy, with no buttons, snaps, or lining coming off. The pockets are big, which is always a plus as a girl. The colour is exactly as pictured as well. It is the warmest jacket I have ever owned. I live in a place with intense lake-effect snow and very high winds with wind chills that freeze cars into blocks of ice, and this coat actually leaves me over-heating slightly at times while out braving the elements.The only downside is how big and baggy the hood is. I know this is because it\'s space for a winter hat, but for when you\'re not wearing one, the hood just flaps and falls all over the place. It doesn\'t have drawstrings, unfortunately. When I\'m walking in the wind, I\'m usually holding the hood for dear life. It does have clasps that help hold it in place that cross a bit around my mouth but it\'s still pretty baggy after that. I know the answer is ""well, wear a hat"" but that\'s not always doable.Regardless of the hood, I have recommended this to so many people.

No one is going to mistake this for a designer suit jacket because the material will not stand up to close inspection. Same thing with the workmanship, there are obvious overlapping stitches at the corners of the front. Not very noticeable because it’s black thread on black fabric, but will not stand up to close inspection.The longer length gives this blazer a slimming effect.

(depending on where you live, this coat may suit you year round. The FLEECE lining (not an easy thing to find) is so comfortable and just the right weight/warmth. Personally, a Sherpa lining is too hot for me.-Repels water-Cinched, adjustable waist-Flattering fit-Perfect length. I am 5’11” tall and weigh 235 lbs. I have long arms and a long torso. This coat covers my bottom completely and hits about 8” above my knees. I ordered the 3X and it fits perfectly. I normally wear a size 18, but find Amazon clothing runs at least 2 sizes smaller than U.S. sizes.-Love the notch at center back hem to add style-Sleeves are generous in fit and also in length. Sleeves that are too restrictive in the upper arms are always an issue for me. Not with this coat.-Not at all restrictive in shoulders-No unattractive “logo” embroidered on the coatCONS:-Fleece lining in sleeves. Why? Wish sleeves were polyester/tricot lined. It is hard to get your arm in the sleeves when wearing long sleeved tops.-Sizing is inconsistent. Navy is more generous than the black (ordered navy and black). Tags sewn into neckline are even different on the navy and the black. Why??? They should be identical.-Velcro on sleeve hem is annoying. For some reason, the black coat does not have Velcro on the sleeve hem, which I am happy about. I removed the Velcro on the navy coat. It serves no purpose and attracts lint and when you don’t use it, the Velcro shows and it is scratchy and unattractive.I would give this 5 stars if it weren’t for the fleece lining in the sleeves, the Velcro on the sleeve hem and inconsistent sizing.

My previous jacket is very puffy and ended at my hips with an elastic band. It would ride up often and not fully cover me. Plus, the synthetic down would keep shifting, so I wound up with all the lining in the sleeves and front and none in the back. My one gripe is that there's nothing in particular that defines the waist. No pull strings or buttons. It all relies on the stitching pattern. I often work in a chiller and walk-in freezer (-10°). I used to layer two jackets going into the chiller as one was never enough. With this jacket, I only need to use this. With the freezer, we are provided freezer suits and I've also tended to layer my jacket with the suit. But now with this jacket on, I keep the suit front zipper open to vent out heat because I get too warm.Outside hasn't been too cold yet (writing this at the dawn of winter) but comparing this to my previous jacket, this one has made the weather feel more like a warm autumn day. The hood blocks my peripheral vision but it keeps the rain out.

The big issue is that it’s not cut for a woman who has actual boobs. It’s very stylish and formfitting for an effective cold weather coat. Just not enough room in the chest for top heavy women.

I will keep the size even though you cannot adjust the waist.

The snaps to cover the zipper is too heavy duty. I guess in case you get into a snowball fight or go tabogganning. The snaps will be a pain to use because they are not easy to snap close.

Maybe…', 'author': 'Rebecca morton', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'The media could not be loaded. I bought this jacket for my summer trip to Ireland and Scotland. I am so glad I did because it rained every single day. Some days we had passing sprinkles, others it was basically monsoon season. Im usually a Large, but got an XL so I could layer the jacket with a hoodie. The Large would have worked fine for this, the XL was almost too big. There were lots of pros and cons, here are mine.Pros:- It kept me dry. We were in all kinds of weather and this jacket kept me dry. Obviously this is important as far as rain coats go.- It was nice and long. I have a long torso so I absolutely despise clothing that leaves a gap every time I bend over to tie my shoe or pick up something from the floor. This jacket’s length was perfect.- The pockets are a good size! I was able to fit my keys, wallet and passport in just one pocket.- The zipper and ties worked without issues. The zipper was easy to attach and detach, the quality was fine, and never jammed on other fabric while using it. The ties had metal ends and the cords was a good quality.- The jacket had a decent weight to it. It wasn’t so heavy you felt weighed down in it like a winter coat might. But it wasn’t so light that the wind could blow it up, and it was windy!- The hood was plenty deep! It covered my entire head and was deep enough to shield my face.Cons:- The jacket material is thin enough to see the liner through it. When I opened it, at first glance I wanted to return it. I wasn’t impressed that the you can see the liner thru the outer layer of the coat. It was disappointing.- The color didn’t match the photo. The pink is more of a tan-ish pink.- I was gentle with the snaps. Don’t get me wrong, the snaps worked great, but I was gentle unsnapping the coat because I was worried about ripping the fabric. It could have been that, because the fabric was see through I didn’t feel it was strong enough to just pull the snaps apart all willy-nilly.- The hood didn’t have a lot of structure. While it was deep enough, the edging/ opening didn’t have a lot to it so unless it was tied tight around the face, it would just kind of blow in the wind. And if it’s really windy, the edge would just continually slap against your face, which was annoying.- The ties at my waist worked, but they left a weird flap, which you can see in the video. The stitching should have gone all the way to the zipper. Since it doesn’t, when you tighten the waist ties, you’re left with the weird flaps and it makes you feel almost dumpy. I tired pulling the all the extra material to the back, but with normal wear it shifts to a natural position and you end up with the flaps.- The jacket doesn’t breathe. The lining is 100% polyester, plus the plastic/rubbery outside meant you will sweat. In colder temps that’s not a huge deal, but we were in and out of buildings so I was constantly zipping and unzipping to regulate my body temp.Overall it’s not a bad rain jacket for the price. If I bought it again I’d get a darker color, hopefully the lining wouldn’t be as obvious, and id fix the weird flaps in front.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 20, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars great golfing rain jacket.', 'author': 'patricia Belmar', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""great quality for the money, great fit. wards off water. light weight. doesn't interfere with play. good deal"", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 12, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Definitely waterproof...', 'author': 'C. Valdez', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""Bought this coat to wear during a vacation in Alaska this summer. I brought it with me for a bear finding excursion in Hoonah as it was overcast and looking to rain. The coat was super lightweight and I was able to pack it into my camera bag easily and without much extra weight at all.After a long drive into Tongass Nat'l Forest, we finally saw a brown bear. We all got out and watched and photographed it from a safe distance for a while. Then we headed back to the port...on a winding, bumpy, unpaved road and at an unnecessary, slightly high rate of speed. The scopolamine patch I was wearing behind my ear couldn't even slightly lessen the motion sickness that came over me. Despite several minutes of trying to convince myself that I was fine, and despite many silent bargaining attempts with any higher powers that be, I quickly came to realize there was no stopping it. I was going to throw up. Sitting in the second to last row of the van with the knowledge that if I tried to talk I'd probably vomit instead, I knew I had about 30 seconds to find some sort of receptacle. All I had on me was my camera bag, and that was filled with expensive equipment that I was not about to get sick on.Then I remembered - I've got my raincoat! My ridiculously cute, red raincoat that I haven't even gotten to wear yet. With no time to debate any other options, I pulled it out of my bag, folded it up, and quietly threw up into it. Three times. My family had the driver pull over, my daughter took the coat and basically shook it out, folded it up and stuck it in a box in the back of the van. Zero leaks, zero odor in the van on the remaining drive back to port - if not for my family asking to pull over, no one would've even known I got sick.I ended up throwing the coat away in port - I realized it'd probably be cheaper to buy a new one than pay the laundering fee and huge (well deserved) tip to housekeeping for washing it.The coat fit beautifully, was adorable and lightweight, and absolutely waterproof.

I was worried that if the jacket became soaked, I would get wet too, but I didn't...and it got SOAKED. It also dries pretty fast which is a relief on a fast paced tour! There was a day we found ourselves in a down pour and my pants did get super wet in the knees where the coat was draining as I was walking, but I was so impressed with how dry I was under the coat. I will say, on the downpour day, the pockets got wet if I put my hands in them, so plan ahead for a place to stash your things under the jacket. Otherwise, I was glad for the pockets and used them frequently. It works well as a windbreaker too and helped to keep the chill away, but I was glad to have a wool sweater layer on the chilliest windy days. I ordered a size up and am glad I did as layers were a must. I love that it cinches in the waist to show your figure.

It has a shiny omniheat lining, the color is accurate, and is hooded. I bought this so I\'d have a packable jacket for snowshoeing, and this was perfect. It kept me warm and dry in an intense sleet-filled snow storm while I was trekking around. I was also able to easily roll it up tightly and stuff it in an already full backpack when I didn\'t need it.I read reviews saying this runs small, and so I sized up since I wanted to be able to layer underneath it. I\'m 5\'5"", 125lbs, and my measurements are 34-27-37. I\'m a small/4 in most brands, but I went with a medium for this jacket. The medium is perfect--it\'s slightly fitted, but roomy enough to fit a thick sweater or multiple thin layers underneath it. For snowshoeing, I had on a bodysuit, thin turtleneck, running hoodie, and hardshell rain jacket all underneath it at one point and I was still very comfortable and not constricted.

Plus size with normal size arms!! Perfect zip up sweatshirt!!', 'author': 'John and Amber', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Five stars ALL DAY. Here’s the thing about plus size clothes… Sometimes (oftentimes), especially when ordering a sweatshirt, we like to order up a size or two so that the sweatshirt, or whatever cozy item we order, is extra cozy, loosefitting, oversized, etc. The problem that plus size women run into is when ordering up, everything else tends to be a lot bigger including the shoulders, the arms, the wrists, the length of the pants or arms of shirt or whatever it is that you’re ordering. This is a huge problem I run into when ordering a size up or just when ordering plus size clothes in general.Manufacturers tend to think that plus size women have gigantic or super long arms and extremely long legs. The truth is, a lot of us plus size women are shorties and you can absolutely be petite and plus size!The GREAT thing about this zip up hoodie is that it has normal size arms and wrists! It’s a normal length. The length of the arms is normal. I’m thrilled. I’m so pleased, in fact, that I am ordering another one literally right now. I have the blue one in my cart. This “just my size” brand is great. They really understand the fact that just because you’re heavier in the chest and waist and butt/thigh area, does not mean that you have super gigantic arms and wrists, and it does not mean that you have super long arms or super long legs. I really appreciate a plus size company that understands this. I will specifically look for this brand more often and purchase from this brand more often because of this fact.Now onto this specific sweatshirt- I got the white one despite the fact that I have a toddler because I love white sweatshirts. It came crisp and clean. The inside is super super super cozy. Like the softest fleece kind of feeling ever. More importantly for me, it’s very light weight. I get overheated very easily. So I absolutely love when I can find something long sleeve or a sweatshirt that is lightweight and doesn’t make me feel like I’m dying of heat stroke. Plus I don’t like bulky sweatshirts and this is not bulky whatsoever.I did size up one size! I like my sweatshirts baggy, not fitted. Sizing up one size was perfect for me. If I had gotten my regular size, it would’ve fit just fine but I like it baggy in the stomach area and hips and butt area. That’s exactly what I got with this sweatshirt. But guess what, despite the fact that I ordered up a size, the arms and wrists and lengths are still perfect and petite and normal. And because of that, the sweatshirt gets five stars. I would give it more if I could and I will definitely be buying more. Now I’m gonna go look for sweatpants. In sweatpants, I typically get my usual size so here’s hoping that the length is great on their brand sweatpants. I have no doubt it will be because the length was great on their sweatshirt arms.Thank you “just my size“ for understanding women’s plus size bodies and the fact that a lot of us have normal size legs and arms.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 2, 2021', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '3.0 out of 5 stars No quality control for sizing', 'author': 'Quiltygal', 'rating': 3, 'content': 'A nice, basic sweatshirt made from soft material.

It works under my jacket, but its not super warm like a thicker hoodie would be once the wind picks up, so that was disappointing.I\'m giving it 4 stars because the hoodie is short in the arms, which were slightly tight when I pushed them up on my forearms. For as long as the hoodie is, the arms are fairly short, so someone with longer arms than me might want to know that. Also, I just noticed a thread around the waist starting to unravel, after less than a week. :-/It was only $13, so I would probably buy again in Black instead of Dark Heather Grey, and I would maybe try a 4X to see if the arms are any longer.

Especially if you are tall!', 'author': 'Erin Samuelsen', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I really needed something in between a sweatshirt and my heavy winter coat for those milder but still chilly days. I always have a very hard time finding jackets. I am tall and have long arms. Most jackets fit like a belly shirt with 3/4 sleeves. Not this one! The jacket sits right at my hips which is perfect and the sleeves actually come down to my wrists! It’s relatively warm. I usually wear a hoodie anyways, so with one hoodie and the jacket, I’m comfortable to about 30 degrees. If I later two sweatshirts, I can stand a smidge colder. But that’s perfect because that’s why I bought it. I’ve got my big thick coat for when it’s really cold. This jacket is also very lightweight and can be stuffed into the little bag that comes with it, so if you are out and need to take it off, you don’t have to schlep a big bulky coat. It’s also pretty decent with being water resistant. It’s NOT a rain coat, so if you wear it in a downpour, you will still get soaked. But for a day when it’s drizzly, it does a good job keeping me dry. The hood fits really well and actually stays put too. One other thing, I like the material. It’s not one of those fabrics that list sounds and feels scratchy. It’s nice and soft and slick, but it’s not that kind of material that falls apart if you look at it funny either.Overall, a really fantastic lightweight jacket, especially if you are tall or have long arms.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 14, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Very cute jacket', 'author': 'Susan Regan', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'The color of the jacket is very bright, which I like.

So, I checked Amazon and of course…they had what I needed. A great price and prime delivery. I didn’t know what to expect from an Amazon product line coat. But let me say, I love this jacket! It does not look cheap, has zipper pockets, an inside pocket, a hood and a packable bag attached to the inside. The best thing about it is the wrist cuffs—they are slightly tapered and slightly stretchy. So they stay in place but you can push them up easily to check your watch. It will definitely be warm enough for 50 degree temps. I ordered one size up (I ordered a Large) but would normally wear a Medium jacket. The large fits good with room enough to wear a fleece or sweatshirt underneath. If I wasn’t planning to wear a fleece under it, the Medium would fit perfectly. I may order another color in a medium.

Other than that, I found it to be very comfortable, warm, and not overly bulky. Plus the pink color is cute! While I wish it fit into the bag, it isn’t hard to fold down and roll to fit into a suitcase or backpack. With it being quite light, it is definitely a jacket I won’t mind toting on trips.

It needs to be big enough to add layers underneath and small enough to fit under the outer jacket. I am 5’8, about 140. I have wide shoulders and long arms which usually poses a problem with sizing. I ordered the size Medium. The jacket fits well but it too narrow in the shoulders and the sleeves are too short with arms extended. I understand this jacket is meant for casual use, not mountaineering. Still, I thought I would review some important parts of this jacket to help you make your decision. First, this grey color is a bit silvery but I like it. The jacket looks very nice; not overly puffy and not too flat. The inside of the jacket is lined with similar fabric as the outside - in other words, it does not have a brushed or fabric lining. There are two, deep pockets inside the jacket, along the zipper. They are plenty deep for, phones, keys etc… probably even a 16oz water bottle! There are two zippered pockets outside which are deep enough to put your hands fully into beyond the wrist. The sleeves have a narrow elastic band at the wrist which seems sufficient. They are not adjustable. The hood is large and is not adjustable. This could be an important point for some. When zipped up all of the way, the zipper came to right below my chin. There is no zipper cover or cloth flap to keep the zipper from rubbing on your chin. There is no flap over or behind the zipper which could allow for wind to blow through or freezing of the zipper if exposed to snow/sleet. I don’t know if the zipper is water resistant like the fabric. I like most of the Amazon Basics stuff and this jacket did not disappoint. In this case, I will order a large to see how they compare in the shoulders and sleeves. It looks like a nice jacket for casual use.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 6, 2021', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars packable, longer torso, 400 g jacket, 8 g travel bag, 3 g clip', 'author': 'Geode', 'rating': 4, 'content': ""Amazon added a feature where you can put in your weight and other details and it will recommend a size for you. It recommended between a medium and a large for me. I wanted a snug fit so I got a medium. It did fit snugly like I want it. My weight varies between 130 and 150 pounds and I am now at the higher end of my weight. I am petite, 53, and big chested. I found the torso to be a tiny bit long, but that isn't a big deal for the price. Also my backside is a bit big and the jacket reaches a tiny bit onto it past my hips because of the longer torso. Rolling up the bottom a tiny bit shortens the torso and keeps the jacket off of my backside where it is too tight. I don't really like the color, but I was trying to spend as little as possible on this jacket so I got the cheapest color, which is probably the least desirable.Lots of people have asked about the weight of this jacket and have not gotten an answer. I put the jacket in a box to make it easier to weigh as it kept on coming unfolded, and then I subtracted the weight of the box from the total weight. I got 400 g for the medium jacket, 8 g for the travel bag, and 3 g for the clip making a total of 411 g for the entire set up. You would think that they would advertise the weight but they don't. You can see the shipping weight, but that is the weight of the entire package instead of the weight of the jacket. I will add a bit to the shipping week to make sure there is enough leeway. I have not been able to get it to fit in a travel bag. If you can get it to fit there I would encourage you not to store it in its travel bag because jackets and sleeping bags should not be stored in a compressed state, especially synthetic ones. I have tried really hard and can't do it. I'm not sure if I really need its travel back. I'm not an expert, but I believe it would be fine to put it in a backpack uncompressed and then use the compression straps as necessary. It is a huge like a sleeping bag where it could be helpful to have a stuff sack.I believe that if you are using this jacket as part of a proper layering system, you could be fine down to 20°. Perhaps if you were wearing thermal underwear you would be fine a bit lower.. I was just thinking of having it with a moisture wicking long sleeve shirt well actively moving when making my 20° estimate. Without actively moving I would estimate you would need a light weight pullover fleece to get that same 20° and if you started moving with that set up you could get to 10° perhaps. Perhaps with thermal underwear, the shirt over it, the fleece pullover, and then this jacket you could make it below 0°. It depends a lot on whether you are moving, what else you are wearing, and how cold you get. A lot of people are asking though so I thought I would try to estimate. With a sleeping bag it is a lot easier to get a temperature rating because someone is just sleeping. For something over 50° though, I think it might get too hot and it would be better to have a pullover fleece. I don't get cold that easily though. It would be interesting to see what others think of my estimates.I don't really know The purpose of the clip. The instructions also seem to indicate that you can wash it just the way you would wash any other type of clothing, but water resistant jackets normally need to be washed with a special detergent to maintain their waterproofing properties so I'm a bit confused about that. The only other problem I have with the jacket is that I wish it were a bit more breathable, but most jackets of this style have that problem. If your other clothing is breathable I think it would be fine. If I paid $300 for this jacket I would bump the rating down to three stars, but because I paid $30 for this jacket, the rating is four stars."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2021', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Quality warm coat', 'author': 'Do the Thing', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'I got this coat after being recommended it by a friend.

I got the pink in medium which fit perfectly. I wouldn\'t say this a true denim though, it\'s more like a light and incredibly stretchy cotton. Honestly, I wasn\'t expecting to like it as all the other denim jackets I\'ve tried have felt too restrictive with little stretch (I have broad shoulders) but this one is incredibly stretchy and extremely comfortable, that I was quite surprised. It is a little boxy though (no shaping darts), but I don\'t plan to wear it closed, so it doesn\'t matter. I did find it more comfortable to roll the sleeves since they were a tad long, but it added to the cute style of this jacket . I live in a warmer climates and this is a perfect for my needs (cooler nights or air conditioned offices). I\'ve worn it a few times already and it is starting to show a little wrinkling. I haven\'t washed it yet to know how it\'ll hold up. But I am already thinking about buying another color! Things to remember, it\'s lightweight, and very stretchy (at least the pink is) and treat it more as a layering piece or as an ensemble/accessory piece rather than a true \'coat\' or jacket. If you live somewhere with 4 seasons, it\'ll be best for Spring or early Fall.Update 1-4-23: I loved the pink one so much, I bought the Always Black in the same size. Oddly enough, the Always Black one was too small, scratchy and stiff - no stretch at all. Looking closer at the material for each color I noticed they\'re different. For instance, most are a blend of 71% cotton, 27% polyester and 2% spandex. But the Always Black is 97% cotton and 3% poly, without any spandex. So that made a huge difference.

I'm small/med, went with small"", 'author': 'RPandersons', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'This is an awesome jacket that I initially struggled over ordering b/c I was unsure of sizing and fit.I am writing this review to help someone torn btw getting the SML or MED. For reference, I am 5\'4"", 130-135 lbs with a 34DD/E bust, long arms, narrow shoulders and hips. Jean size 27.Reading other people\'s reviews, I was surprised how many people have very similar, to exact, dimensions as me, yet how differently we all may want the jacket to fit depending how we plan to wear it.As a 52-year-old-post-partum-middle-aged-chick, I was looking for a narrow streamlined fit that would not add any bulk whatsoever to my frame. Also, I live in SoCal and did not plan to wear this over anything other than a tshirt, blouse or very thin dress or sweater. Also, I would wear this jacket totally open and unzipped 97% of the time, so I got the SMALL. When it is zipped and buttoned up all the way, the SMALL on me is a tight, but not binding, streamlined, almost a 1960s Mod Squad look. Truly fits like a glove and sleeve length is perfect.Had I ordered the Medium, I would have felt obligated to wear the jacket closed, over layers or a big sweater or hoodie; because totally open and unzipped, the front panels of the Medium would have hung and flapped around my body excessively (if that makes sense) and the shoulders would have drooped/been oversized, rounded, like a slouchy, casual 1990\'s fit. My teen daughter who is 5\'8 and a size 0-2 (so, a human clothes hanger) would probably get this very same jacket in a Medium or even a Large because she likes that oversized look, and can carry it off really well.I hope this review helps someone else with my proportions. I may order one in a MEDIUM in case I ever want room to really bundle-up with lots of other layers or a really thick sweater for much colder weather. But, I think if that happened I would just wear a longer coat to stay warm.

The cotton lining was too warm for this and to boot, I didn\'t like the fit. So I returned it and wrote a review here saying that it would be nice for keeping warm. The fall comes and now I\'m looking for a midweight jacket, something that will keep me warm in the 50s and (with layering) 40s. I reorder this jacket in the next size down, since I found it too big before. Not warm enough and I still didn\'t like the fit and the quality of the manufacturing (seams mostly) just seemed under-impressive. I dunno, I just wouldn\'t recommend.ORIGINAL REVIEW:This jacket had a boxy fit. I followed the review recommendations and sized up. It was comfortably loose. I don’t think a smaller size would have helped with the fit all, it just would have just made the jacket tighter. I am returning for this reason. However, the material was nice quality.

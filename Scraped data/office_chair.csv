Well, it finally broke and I decided to give this one a try. I like it. It's easy to assemble and comes with the tools you need. The feet and wheels are metal, as is the hydraulic piston and the controls. The seat cushion is well padded and feels good to sit in for long office days. I was a little worried about the mesh seat back. I was a bit worried that it might be cheap or thin. Easily torn or ripped. I was wrong to worry. The mesh is sturdy and unless you really try to tear it, it should last a long time.Two things to note.Compared to my old chair, this one is very light. lighter than you would expect when looking at the pics. No real negative to this and can be a positive if you're an older person or have back problems. You won't have trouble lifting or moving this chair.Secondly, I replaced the stock wheels that this chair comes with, with a set of roller blade wheels they make for office chairs. Makes it easier to roll through carpets and they worked fine on my old chair. I'm five foot, ten inches tall and with the new wheels on this chair, my feet can't reach the floor at the chairs lowest setting. So if you are a shorter person, you wont be able to use the after market, roller blade type carpet wheels with this chair. Not the chairs fault, and its the correct height with the wheels the chair comes with.Over all, i'm very happy with this chair.Oh, and great lower back support. I have a very bad back."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 1, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Workspace Comfort with the SMUG Office Computer Desk Chair', 'author': 'Mark Melrose', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""In the modern era of remote work and long hours spent at desks, finding the perfect chair becomes paramount.

However the comfort did not disappoint. I was having doubts about the main cushioning but it is good- kind of middle of the road. It holds up and is enjoyable to sit in but not quite the top of the line feel. Added bonus is the ability to rock and lean back a little. Also that little space to store something on the rear.

It\'s now July. That\'s three months right? Well that\'s how long it lasted. If you look closely at the product picture there\'s a seam on top of one of the legs. Well that\'s because for whatever reason that leg is the only one that comes detached. Why does it come detached? I couldn\'t tell you. The box it comes in is big enough for it to be a single structure base like it should be.Anyways, during that three months it was an ok chair. Once you get past how terrible the foam padding is. The arm rests are short and the foam is barely a quarter inch thick. The seat has about 2.5 inches of what I can only describe as that basic yellow spongey foam. You bottom out in it pretty fast.The ""lumbar support"" sits so far back in the chair that it doesn\'t actually do anything unless you force yourself all the way back. And at that point you kinda go past the cushion.The wheels are made out of rubber which is the only thing I\'m going to give them credit for (at least for the thought). They stay out pretty well and don\'t roll out from under you when you go to sit. However, they will pick up literally everything they roll on top of and it\'s pretty gross.Now, on to the leg. I\'m not rough on any of my furniture whatsoever. There\'s not really any good way of sitting in this where it feels stable unlessyou put two legs in like a tripod position in the back. This causes an issue because if the detachable leg ends up in the back it very very quickly becomes an issue. The plastic that the base is made out of is pretty soft and that\'s where the biggest flaw is. Any time you lean back you put pressure on that leg if it\'s in the back. The plastic that it goes into is rather thin but the actual wedge on the leg that slots into the base is solid. Lean back too many times and that plastic flexes, wears out, then splits. A couple days before the leg broke out of the base I was confused why it seemed like it was leaning back and to one side. That should\'ve been my first inkling that it was breaking. When it did break it dumped me backwards out of the chair and onto the floor.My recommendation for them is to make the base one solid base. Don\'t add more failure points than you have to. Literally one of the first rules of design. Adding a detachable leg overcomplicates things. I\'d also recommend that they add a sixth leg to it because really it could\'ve used it. Or at the very least switch the plastic that\'s used and give the detachable leg a little more to slot into. Less than a quarter of an inch for the walls is not enough when the wedge on the leg is solid plastic.Its been 6 months since I bought it. I just had to buy a new chair because the back broke off of it. DO NOT BUYTldr: don\'t buy this. Idk how or why this chair has so many high reviews. Wouldn\'t be surprised if they\'re paid for because while it\'s a cheap chair, it should\'ve lasted much more than 3 months.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States July 14, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '3.0 out of 5 stars Not sturdy - not lasts for 5 months', 'author': 'Luna', 'rating': 3, 'content': 'I purchased the white/grey version back in June 2023 due to the good reviews.

Honestly, this chair is pretty good in terms of back support with the lumbar section. The arm and seat cushion are great and I can sit for for hours straight. The wheels and the chair was generally quite squeaky when I moved around, which annoyed me. However, this chair has recently, after 5 months, started to slowly disassemble itself. The chair does not stay at the height that I set it to; after a few hours of sitting on the chair, it would sink to the lowest level.

It took me about 30 minutes to put this chair together but I can\'t say for sure because I didn\'t actually time myself and my need for perfectly aligned holes may have lengthened the time significantly. I did it by myself and it was a real snap to do.2) The plastic portions of the chair seem very sturdy and not flimsy like some office chairs I\'ve had in the past. They seem like they will stand up to wear over time but that remains to be seen. The seat cushion is definitely comfier than I expected, it is firm and seems like it can easily snap back into shape after a long day of someone sitting in it.3) The backrest is perfect for me, I have a bad habit of hunching forward because my previous chair had no support or cushioning but then again, I was using a wooden chair. The lower lumbar support is very nice as it keeps me from hunching over at my desk by instead, encouraging me to lean back and give my spine a break. I have the reclining knob set to its furthest capability to help with this.4) This may not be the office chair for tall people or anyone seeking to be higher up but I find it suitable for me. At its highest position, the heels of my feet are less than an inch off the floor and I am only 5\'2"" tall, so I guess it will depend on what you are looking for.5) The wheels seem like they will hold up great and while I know this is more of a pet peeve than an actual complaint about the product, I feel it is important people know that this chair DOES NOT move across low-pile carpeting very easily. If you are like me and you have wall-to-wall carpeting you may want to purchase one of those plastic floor mats or replacement wheels designed for carpeting to ensure maximum rolling capability. To me, it doesn\'t matter at this point because I have no real space or need to roll around in my chair except for pure amusement.6) My only REAL complaint about this office chair is the width. I honestly didn\'t think to pay attention to this when purchasing. I am a decently hippy woman, as in, I have some pretty damn wide hips and this chair is a little too narrow in the seat for what I would be comfortable with. This is not to say my booty doesn\'t fit in the chair because it does but oh boy, I can\'t get much wider than I am right now, or else this chair is going to charity. I measured the shortest distance between the front of the two armrests and they are 17-1/2"" apart so please take that into consideration if you are a curvy woman like me.OVERALL (TLDR), this is a great chair for the price. Easy assembly, the materials appear durable and up to the task of keeping my butt comfortable on a daily basis. The lumbar support is excellent, the height adjustment is perfect as is the recline mechanism. The only two downsides are that the wheels don\'t glide effortlessly across my carpet and that the armrests are just a little too close for a curvy body type.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States July 12, 2022', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great Chair', 'author': 'Bari', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I love this chair.

I was well within my return period but did not want to go through the hassle of dismantling, repackaging and sending the chair back, and this was mandatory for both of my return options which were a replacement chair or a refund of my money. So, I reached out to the seller via Amazon with fingers crossed and explained the situation and provided them with some photos of the damage. They responded VERY quickly and agreed to my request to just send me a replacement castor so I could replace the broken one. As I had hoped, they did not just send one castor either but a sleeve of five just like you receive when you purchase a chair initially. They also shipped them out quickly and provided me with tracking information. So with minimal back and forth they were very helpful and efficient with correcting my issue, I appreciate their customer service very much. The chair itself is exactly what you would expect from a $40 chair, it could be more comfortable and ergonomic and this and that but it is now stable, provides decent back support and raises/lowers easily. Plus, I have four extra wheels now in case the overall quality of them proves to be an ongoing issues.

The chair I received is only 19 inches wide at the widest point any way I measure it. Update: I brought this up to the company and they are supposed to be working with the manufacturer to correct this.There is also a rip in the bottom of the fabric on the seat cushion upon opening the box. The chair was packed well and there was no way it was ripped when opening the box the way the seat cushion was packed. This was definitely a manufacturing defect. I have emailed the company, we will see what they say. - Update: They have fixed this without issue. Customer service was very good!As for comfort - the seat cushion is pretty hard and as NO contour. It is just flat. I couldn't get the headrest positioned well for me, so I just took it off. May work for some people. Update: Seat may be softening some.

As someone who spends long hours working at the desk, this chair has transformed my daily grind into a comfy and supportive experience.Pros:Ergonomic Bliss:This chair is a dream for my back. The ergonomic design gives me the right amount of lumbar support, making those long work sessions much more bearable. No more midday backaches – hallelujah!Adjustable Heights Galore:I love how I can tweak the height to my liking. Whether I'm sitting at the desk or need a quick break at a slightly higher or lower level, this chair's got my back – literally. It's like having a custom-made chair that fits me perfectly.Breathable Comfort:The mesh back is a game-changer, especially during the warmer months. It keeps me cool and comfy, preventing that dreaded sticky feeling you get with some chairs. It's the small details like this that make a big difference.Smooth Swivel Action:The 360-degree swivel is surprisingly satisfying. Need to grab something from the other side of the desk? No problem! The smooth rotation means no awkward stretching or shuffling around, and I can spin in my chair just for fun when I need a quick break.Sturdy and Stylish:This chair doesn’t just deliver on comfort; it looks good too. The sleek design adds a touch of modernity to my home office setup, and the sturdy build gives me confidence that it's not going to give out on me anytime soon.Cons:Assembly Challenge:Putting it together took a bit longer than expected. The instructions were clear, but it required a bit of patience. Once it was assembled, though, it was worth the effort.Armrests are Fixed:The armrests are fixed, so they don’t adjust up or down. While they're at a comfortable height for me, those who prefer customizable armrests might find this a bit limiting.In conclusion, the Naspaluro Ergonomic Office Chair is a gem for anyone looking to upgrade their home office comfort. It's not just a chair; it's a thoughtful investment in your well-being. The adjustable features, breathable design, and overall sturdiness make it a winner in my book. If you want to transform your workspace into a haven of comfort without breaking the bank, this chair is a fantastic choice.

Hits above its weight class for sure.My wife is 5’. She’s small. For whatever reason she ended up with a chair made for big people, like 6+ feet and up to 500lbs type of a chair. She’d often even sleep on it and chill on it. The chair was big enough to fit 2 of her to be honest. It was an expensive chair that I won at some raffle and didn’t like myself. Over the years it ripped (got a cover for it) and even started to get lopsided (from the sleeping) and finally a spring broke (hence the pillow on it in the pictures)She obviously lives pink. I also wanted to get a chair where she could work and not end ip asleep on. Not like we have a couch or a bed for that 😂.This chair is very obviously smaller than her previous chair, it’s also significantly cheaper in price and build, it’s also not as durable feeling or stable, and it’s just not as padded. Yet somehow it’s an amazing chair that we both like better than her previous chair???Like it’s crazy that this chair somehow works better in so many ways. Her desk is modified to be shorter than normal desks (again, she small lol) and her previous chair was just too big. The wheels are also like SUPER smooth, like you can run a chair race easily with it. It rolls over her rug and tucks into her desk (which is in our bedroom) easily. The amount of space this has save us when the chair isn’t being used is a lot. Previous chair was much bigger and didn’t tuck in at all.The color is nice and the padding is plenty for a small and much lighter than 500lbs woman. I’m 6 feet and 200 lbs and the chair is nice for me as well. My chair is bigger and more secure in the backing, which is similar to this one. The lowest tension setting on my chair is still too high for her to lean back on my chair. This chair has a lower tension minimum and she can easily lean back freely, as well as keep enough tension to work without sagging.This chair is surprisingly outstanding! I’m sure my wife will destroy it quicker than the last one, but it’s so cheap that even if it only lasts 1-3 years, I’ll happily buy it ones or twice more 🤷🏽\u200d♀️.

After using it a while, I love it. I am on the shorter and smaller side (5\'3""), so it fits me perfectly. If you\'re a taller person I can imagine this would not work well for you as your shoulders would likely rise above the back support.I bought this for two reasons: Aesthetic and material. I\'m extremely pleased with both.The aesthetic is gorgeous. I wanted the ivory one but was worried about staining and/or discoloration over time, so I settled for the brown-with-white and it\'s still a beautiful chair, I love the look of it. It suits my cottagecore/rustic room better than my old chair.My old chair was black plastic with mesh material as the seat/back, and it got crumbs and hair and all kinds of stuff stuck in it. I wanted a chair with a solid seat that would be easy to clean and that I could rest my legs up on without pressing little hole imprints all over my skin. This chair does that. I realize that\'s not the highest of standards, but despite my low and niche requirements, I do think this chair is WELL worth the money for most people. Despite the cost, the material looks and feels quality and the whole unit is well made and stitched beautifully together. The visible stitching adds to the look, in my opinion. While I wasn\'t expecting much quality for the price, this chair far exceeded my expectations.The back of this chair is not particularly ergonomically supportive, but I didn\'t absolutely need that, and for the price you can easily buy your own separate back-support cushion. The way the seat is designed I imagine most would fit well on it. Despite the lack of back support, it\'s a comfortable chair to sit on for hours. The seat remains cushy and comfortable all day, you don\'t start feeling lumps or hard spots like I have on some other chairs.It was easy to assemble (half hour at most?), instructions were clear.

Comes with good instructions, good-fitting parts and is quite easy to assemble.I'm not the most mechanically inclined person around but I do my best to put things together if I need to do so, and I will admit that most the time, if it's possible to put something together completely backwards I usually do just that, then curse a lot about how badly the item was made, but with this I found the instructions very straight forward and helpful, and was able to put the chair together correctly the first time without any problems."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 24, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Pretty and Comfortable l.', 'author': 'B.T.A.', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Packaged very well, pretty easy to put together.

Definitely recommend this chair for fidgety sitters like myself!Update 1/24/24:I'm about 5 months in using this chair daily and the wear is becoming very obvious. The chair now has a very obvious tilt to the left that's causing some back pain. I've taken it apart to look for broken pieces and tightened everything up, but the lean is still there. I love having the foldable arms and wide base to tuck my legs and maneuver around, but I'm a little bummed it didn't last longer.

Okay this is an update since this review I probably had it for about 2 months now we'll have her as long since my last review but anyway I'm finding now that the chair doesn't go up or down I don't know if I installed the hydraulic part incorrectly so I think I have to do take them back apart and see if it I'm doing something wrong which there really was no directions other than you put the chair onto the thing and push it down it was pretty self-explanatory and that was all the directions stating but the fact that I'm pulling and pushing that lever and it's not doing anything back and forth as it states so I will investigate but like I said there was really only one way to do it including it together it wasn't like there was several options during that portion of the installation not sure if anyone else is running to this maybe I'm just not that good with this stuff worst case I'll get a hold of the company if it doesn't get figured out by my investigation. Bit still have these issues and the chair is bulky and not exactly light so I'm not looking forward to it but I will handle it.Fairly easy to put together it was just kind of a pain because I'm only about 6 weeks post hip replacement as well as I have frozen shoulder but I handled it like a boss a petite female without someone always available to put this stuff together and it can be fun until it's not...probably took me a little longer than it should have due to the above reasons but I would recommend it for me due to petite short leg status but again I don't know of anyone bigger size because if they have come over to my house I haven't had them sit on it I forgot.

All the parts were in the box. All of the hardware is labeled including a small pack containing extra pieces of hardware just inn case they are needed. The allen wrench has a T handle and is a step up from what I typically see. The seat and back come covered in plastic.Assembly: Overall the assembly is easy. The steps are in logical order starting with attaching the spider legs (my term) being attached to the center piece. At step 4 of the assembly the instructions show putting a cosmetic cover piece that hides the bolts that attach the legs to the center piece. This cover was not in the box. I reached out to the seller & they promptly responded. The assembly instructions in the box was a first addition. There is a second addition that illuminates that step because the cover is no longer needed. They sent me an electronic version of the correct assembly instructions. I did notice during assembly that there didn’t seem to be a need for the cover because they design looks finished without the cover.Appearance: When assembled the chair looks nice. The feel of the material is nice. The finish of the back and seat were good. There were no issues with poor seams or sloppy sewing lines. It looks like they have a good level of quality control in place.Comfort: The chair feels nice with good lumbar support. I feel like it fits like a glove. However, I’m only 5’6” tall. I wouldn’t expect a taller person to have that kind of fit. The lumbar support is not adjustable. The chair will adjust in height and the recline function can be locked out.Overall I would recommend this chair as a good, no frills chair that’s comfortable.

This one has been fantastic. Way more comfortable than just a basic armless task chair, plus the option to keep the arms down is perfect on this chair. I kept one of my seat cushions, which probably wouldn't have been necessary for some time, but I use it anyway. I don't usually take risks buying a large item that could potentially need to be returned, but I am so happy I did. I have not needed to stand up once, since using this chair (several months).

Not everyone will want them, but the features make this stand out as an option.First of all it is a high back rolling office chair with an adjustable headrest. The headrest is made of a quality mesh like the back. The frame of the chair back, arms and headrest is a strong, dense plastic that will hold up over time. The headrest is adjustable in height. I\'m 5\' 9"", but I have short legs and a very long torso. My torso length is probably equivalent to a 5\' 11"" person. I can comfortably use the headrest, but I had to put it all the way up. A tall person may not be able to use the headrest.The seat and back I find quite comfortable. The material feels like nylon and is easily cleaned, which is important to me because I eat a lot of meals in this chair.Along with the high back, headrest and mesh material, it has another unique feature: the arms adjust in multiple ways. Many office chairs can raise or lower the arms, but these can slide back and forth, be angled inward or outward and be raised and lowered. I find I like the arm rests moved forward and angled inward, but that is a personal preference. This chair gives me the option.I love the pink color. It\'s bright and juxtaposes awesomely with my husband decor!Kensaker was very thoughtful in how this chair is assembled. I included a picture of the inserts that are in each leg where it meets the center base. The plastic inserts act as a cushion and hide the weld marks to give it a finished look. They also spread out the force of the screws, acting as a washer. This makes the chair quieter and helps prevent overtightening of the screws.I also appreciate that the arms wrap under the seat and around the back. This provides excellent strength and helps hide the hardware. The arms have a guide so the left and right arms have to be put on correctly. Also, the included hex wrench is a T-handle, which is much easier to use than a regular Allen wrench. I like that the hardware packet is well marked and all the screws are one size for the wrench. Only the length is different. They also included one extra screw for each type.The instructions are clear. The casters included are typical hard plastic, but are double wheeled and look nice, but they are a little noisy and will eventually wear off the finish on my hardwood floor, unless I use a mat. The chair rolls well.Overall, this is a very good office chair with unique features.This is one of the few times I\'ve felt compelled to make an addition to a review.

It is far too low for me. It is adjustable, but at its highest setting, it hits me right in the shoulders. I am 6\'0"", so while tall, I\'m not exceptionally tall. There is no way for me to sit in the chair comfortably at all. It would work for someone shorter (my wife sits comfortably in it), but if you are even close to 6\', this chair flat out won\'t work for you. The headrest could have been mounted higher, or have a greater range of adjustment, but there\'s no way around it as is, except for removing the headrest.So, it\'s a good chair if you are under 5\'6"", but not for someone taller.

My wife had been trying to get me to purchase a new office chair because the on that I had was getting pretty worn down. I have never been a fan (or so I thought) of the mesh backed office chair because they seemed cheaply made. After trying out our friends chair we decided to take their advice and purchase the same model. The chair itself was easy to put together (about a half hour) and the directions were also easy to understand. The chair pad is thick and very firm, but I can tell that it will get softer over time. The back of the chair is very supportive and sturdy. The feature that I really like is the adjustable head rest that can be moved up or down for different heights and it tilts for support. The arm rests also slide forward and backwards for different lengths and move side to side as well.

The base does not in any way permanently* attach to the upper part of the chair. I expect with weight and time it will essentially embed itself via pressure, but in the interim, lifting the chair from the seat will not take the legs with it.1.5 - This chair has no wheels, which is odd for an office chair. I see now in hindsight the pictures show this, but I honestly just wasn't looking for that because I've never seen an office chair sans wheels. Just highlighting in case you care. I don't really.2. OMG the assembly. When I saw all the ratings for simple assembly I was not expecting this. It's a little gaslighty, yes the assembly is simple in terms of there being few parts and only one included tool necessary. But it's not simple at all in terms of effort. I would have had another person available to help if I knew, it's physically very difficult to get the seat and seat back together, like that took up 90% of the time of assembly.Also, the pre-threaded screw holes on my instance were really poorly angled such that not cross-threading the screws was a monumental effort, and they aren't strongly embedded in the seat. The result of this is that when you're tightening, rather than getting the expected effect of the back bar moving ever closer to flush-with-the-screw hole as you turn the wrench, closing the gap, what happens instead is the pre-threaded hole starts to get yanked out of the seat. There is no good way I could find to apply the necessary pressure to combat this because of the L shape of the object you're dealing with. 1 of 4 of the screws I received is now screwed about halfway in but unable to proceed to completion because doing so is ripping the screw hole from the chair.Final thought: Had the assembly not been such a huge PITA, I'd have given this chair 5 stars in a heartbeat, it's so very comfy and pretty."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 8, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great chair', 'author': 'Am', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""Very happy with my purchase.

I liked how the chair looked, its price point, and it received positive reviews. Unfortunately, my experience with this chair has been underwhelming, to say the least. Several issues, ranging from poor quality to difficult assembly, have left me deeply dissatisfied with my purchase.Let\'s start with the assembly process, which was an absolute nightmare. The instructions provided were not terrible, but not great either. It took me significantly longer than anticipated to assemble this chair, and I consider myself fairly handy. If you\'re not well-versed in putting together furniture, you may find yourself extremely frustrated.Another significant issue I encountered was with the chair\'s hydraulic cylinder. It has already started failing, causing the chair to slowly sink, regardless of the adjustment settings. This rendered the height adjustment feature useless and made for an uncomfortable seating position. I expected a durable and reliable chair, but sadly, this was not the case.The armrests were also a major disappointment. They started to deform and indent where my elbows and arms sit. The rest of the chair is fine. I can sit it in all day, so that is a positive. I mainly lean a bit forward and don\'t have time to lounge backward.On top of all these issues, the Homall Office Chair proved to be quite noisy. Whenever I shifted my weight or made any slight movements, the chair emitted creaking and squeaking sounds. Not only was it an annoyance, but it also disrupted my concentration while working and is embarrassing on conference calls. Having such a distracting and low-quality chair in a professional environment is disappointing.If I read this review I would have a couple of questions about the reviewer. I am 6\'3"" but well below the recommended weight. I review plans and specs as part of my job, so I am good with instructions. My hobby is woodworking which requires skill and a calm demeanor. Yes, I did retighten any connectors that became loose through normal wear and tear.I should have spent more money on a quality chair since I am now looking to purchase a different chair 1 year later.

Well the following may be of value to folks looking for good looking, easy to assemble, leather chairs. These may fit the need. About 75 minutes to assemble both chairs. The rolling of the chairs, we have plexiglass runners under the chairs over an area rug on wood floors, no problems rolling. Pistons no issues, chairs hold position. We are probably average heights and weights. She 5\'9"" 170 lbs, me 5\'11"" 205 lbs. Only issue may be the installation tool provided. Gets the job done however we dropped it at least a 1/2 dozen times. Lastly, we chose brown to match desks and file cabinets. Various colors available. So far these are a tad harder than the La-Z Boys however we think with our use they will probably outlast the La-Z-Boys.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 16, 2022', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great desk chair', 'author': 'Everyday Customer', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Perfect desk chair.

After reading reviews I decided on this one. My daughter is a large gal and I needed something that was a bit sturdier. This chair was advertised as being ""heavy duty"" and accommodating up to 400 lbs. I highly doubt someone 400 lbs. could use this chair and it far too narrow for a heavier person. I have had the chair for about a month and here are some of my thoughts:Pros: Stylish good looks: The leather is attractive and it looks like a much more expensive chair. Easy Assembly: It took me only a short time to assemble it and the instructions were easy to follow. Comfort: The seat and back are reasonably comfortable.Cons: The wheels are awful. They lock up and I end up just scooting the chair across the floor mat. It would be impossible to maneuver the chair on even the lowest pile carpeting. It does not recline to 110° in rocking mode as advertised. It is very tightly sprung and takes a lot of effort to tilt back. This may loosen up with time.In all fairness, I have not yet contacted the company regarding the wheels, but do plan to do so. It is too much of a pain to return the chair after having assembled it, so I plan to keep it, but if I had tried it in a store I would never have purchased it.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 6, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '2.0 out of 5 stars not what expected, and slight damage.... cushion torn !!', 'author': 'mike', 'rating': 2, 'content': ""first off, fast FED GROUND delivery... also height of seat to 21 3/4 is excellent for longer leg users, two great observations in the purchase. fed ex ground delivered a dusty box and other items to farm on dusty hot road... was expected .... not a normal day... smaller box, chair is in there...opened box in center of room and ready for assembly... i have put chairs together before for the various computer tables.. assembled with viewing picture instructions... inventory was on par with one extra screw lag for short and long grommets...Allen wrench is big L shaped and quite handy .. assembled in 15 minutes..wheels went on the best ... must be firm with seat screws as one seamed stripped and then gripped... one chair rest is lose , but with some lock tight, will grip... for a rated Big and tall chair, seat height is there, actuator is easily controlled, arm rest are nicely padded, but short... 34 inch arms here, so rests need to be 3 to 4 inches longer..seat is hard and with 24 hrs seating, already depressing.... so you will lose your leg height to floor from seat...i am 220 clothes on ..chair rated to 400 pounds.... it can make chair less stable, so no rough housing in chair .... for a foam, the seat is quite hard.... not an 8 hr chair, although i thought was rated for longer seating... this is a smaller chair for a Big and Tall executive, not really a Big Tall man's chair... i am over 6 ' 2 and shoulders or at top of back.. high back seems 46 inches though..no real head rest.. shoulder rest there though, but don't snap your neck back stretching.... repeating good things... great Allen wrench, SOFT ARM RESTS, excellent HARD BASE with WHEELS, and seat height will equal 21 inches give or take seat depression, incredible fast fed ex ground shipping......now the BAD, not so comfortable, tiny tall executive chair, screws can easily strip so be positive on the attaching to grommet and aligning up, and the worse for last, THERE WAS A TEAR IN THE BACK CUSHION ON TOP EDGE OF CHAIR.. probably happened in packing or on assembly line... very thin material... after assembly, so tough to return in boxing up again.... i am thinking lock tight on my screw and gorilla tape on my tear.. i would return if easy to box up !!! it was only a 130 purchase with the coupon discount.. be well , be safe...

That being said, when I got it, shipping box and contents inside were all nicely packaged and protected inside and individually wrapped or boxed. The quality of the chair does seem very nice for the price you are paying. I did not get this chair necessarily as a gaming chair as the title of the product states it as. I just liked the look of it and the features it includes. I also wanted a tall back chair for head and neck support. I am 6’3” tall and my last office chair was only a mid level back and old and falling apart. The installation of the chair was actually fairly easy in my opinion. The included paper instructions provided more than enough detail and instruction to get me through it. I did create a customer how to/installation and setup video which should be showing up any day now once approved. Made understanding how to install it a much more fun way to watch it being built from ground up. I’ve had the chair now and have used it for a few days now. The very first full day I had it (I installed it the night before after work), I actually came home super tired and sat down in it. I give the comfortable rating a 7/10. It was comfortable enough especially when reclining the chair back, I actually fell fast asleep it in. Wasn’t a LazyBoy comfort sleeping chair but it was good enough especially for an office chair. I rate it a 7 for a reason though, something I am honestly very disappointed in and debating on rather I can keep it or not. If one tiny issue was fixed, I would likely give this chair and comfort a 9 or 10 rating. My problem is this: the seat itself, is not wide enough. I am of a fairly average build. However with the raised angled ends on the seat itself where it feels like sturdy metal support bars inside, it keeps my hips and thighs so tight together with no room for much of a relaxed open leg seating position. It almost gives a slight bruising feeling on the side of my upper thighs and hips after prolonged time in it and possibly even pushing on veins and arteries in my legs just enough to slightly cut off blood circulation which in turn gives me a slight dead leg with tingle sensation. I have to keep adjusting my legs and move them from keeping this from happening. Also, I feel the seat could had used some sort of opening or circulation to circulate air. It gets to be a pretty warm seat after awhile. If the seat itself was maybe 6 inches wider or else didn’t have the lifted angled sides on the ends of the seat, I’d say this chair is perfect. Back and head and neck support are all great in my opinion. My butt is by no means a wide big butt (haha) so for my wife with wider hips, naturally as a woman, she was uncomfortable in it instantly and didn’t like it whatsoever. If they ever modify this seat I would be willing to update the review. For now, as I said, I would take caution on seeing how the seat feels for you. I would almost pull the seat out and maybe just install the armrests and sit on it on the ground before putting it all together to see what may be an issue for you as well. I will upload a photo of the seat with me in it to show an example once Amazon turns photo uploads for reviews back on, apparently they have turned the option off temporarily citing the COVID as some sort of reason.Update: I added photos as promised now that it gave me the ability to add them. The photos are to show the narrow seat conditions as I say in the chair and my outer thighs and hips and tight up against the elevated sides of the seat.I did purchase another item here on Amazon, a high rated seat cushion pillow which elevated me up a bit off the seat and has tremendously increased the comfort now where my thighs are not being squashed together. Grant it I shouldn’t have to buy something else to make this seat work better and more comfortable but I really didn’t want to have to deal with the time and pain in disassembling the chair and trying to send it back. I made it work. The seat cushion set me back another $30 but it’s worth it and I can technically take it with me elsewhere if I want to use it and it does really major sitting in this office chair a lot more comfortable and cooler temperature as well.

They were coming loose on the armrests on my prior chair, then eventually failed at the bolt head. I see there is loctite applied from the factory on this new one; I don't remember if the old one had that and if not, it will help. However, while I was putting together the new chair using an impact driver on the lowest setting (~15 lb/ft), I managed to break one of the bolts at the head. These are clearly weak bolts and they should never snap this way, especially considering their size. In fact, the small Phillips head screws used to secure the plastic trim seem more stout.

They are all about the same size, so if you're on the fence and want to try it out before dumping a lot of money on a chair, I think this is a 5 star chair for that.Overall I think these are also a bit better than the Amazon Basics mid-back or high back chairs, and I consider leather, even PU leather, much better to sit on than the mesh chairs that are popular. The problem with PU is it will always peel, there's no way around that, and it's only going to really last a few years. Mesh will last a bit longer maybe but isn't really that comfortable.The super expensive office chairs that I've had at work I don't think are at all worth it. But even if you think they are, they are just a lot more expensive.This chair is easy to put together, it takes about 20-30 minutes max and everything is easy to tighten with the included allen wrench. The covers you have to screw in, and I might recommend a regular screwdriver, especially for the deeper holes. There is no hole on the seat cushion for those cover screws, but you don't really need any since the screws are shallow and will screw into the brackets anyway.The chair does smell. Some of it is probably polyurethane and some of it is probably the off-gassing. I'm sure it will go away after a bit, but be prepared for that. Some of the surfaces are also a little dusty, but I used a simple multi-purpose cleaner spray and it came right off.Chair tilts a little backwards, but when you sit on it, it feels straight so I guess that's just how it's supposed to be. The back rest has a tilt/recline feature, which you activate with a lever on the right side almost exactly like a car seat does.The included lumbar and neck pillows are filled with some cheap cushion material and covered also in PU leather. The higher end chairs will give you velour covered memory foam. You can also buy those for $30-50 if you really want to as well.I would say if you like this style of chair, the next real upgrades are real grain leather and Napa leather options. That will set you back $500+ and $700+ and you can really only get them from Noble Chairs or Secretlab. I plan to do this for the Napa at some point, albeit they are out of stock, and chances are the price will get closer to $1k. I am not fully sure if those will last longer either, you might just be better off buying this chair every few years instead.As I wrote above, PU chairs are all pretty much the same. The material really doesn't change. They all seemingly use a nylon base, PU leather, steel frame and foam for the cushions. This chair says it uses a shaping sponge, while the others say they use cold cured foam. The cold cured foam maybe is a step above, and the velour with memory foam pillows probably are too, but I'm not sure that it's worth the $300+ most of the gaming racing chairs charge. I seriously think once you start going above this price point at $100-120 or so, the next upgrade has got to be in the upholstery, and nothing else really will matter as much.Overall I'd give this chair a solid 3 or 4, but for the right person it's a 5. That's the problem with the rating system, I don't know exactly what you personally are looking for. An inexpensive chair that will last a couple of years or more and is in this style, it's a 5 easily. If you're looking for really high quality, and it's just a step for you, maybe it's a 3 or 4. But at this price point I can't justify anything below 5 stars, so I give it a 5, and I urge people that want to try this style out to seriously consider grabbing this one first, if they can't test out a higher priced chair for awhile and don't feel comfortable just dropping a higher price amount without testing something.Edit 1 Week: Smell was really terrible for the first 2-3 days, but then faded and is fine/gone now. Might not be a bad idea to let this air out a few days somewhere.The arms got wobbly and I had to re-tighten the bolts. I had to do this two times. Not sure if this will be a continuing issue or not.I'm still undecided whether I will stick with this or go for a better leather version. I really don't want to get another PU version, so for that I'll probably stick with this. But if I see a good deal on the real leather and napa leather options I'm leaning towards getting that, and giving this one to someone else as a gift."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States April 7, 2018', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '3.0 out of 5 stars We, as a society, need to rethink chairs like this', 'author': 'Keegs', 'rating': 3, 'content': ""Look, whoever started the trend of leather gaming chairs needs a stern talking-to.This might apply to all gaming chairs (I play games but wouldn't consider myself a serious gamer si IDK), but there are some serious problems with a chair like this:1.

This chair features a flat leather seat. Think that through. There's no mesh. No cloth. Your ass is literally suction-cupped to this leather panel. Where do you think that fart is going the second you feel the urge? If you're a gamer and are spending multiple hours in front of a screen, there's a big chance, you're gonna have to fart at some point. Do you peel your sweaty butt from the synthetic leather surface to let one rip? Or do you take your chances of a full-on backfire while seated?And that's only the start of it.This seat is made of a material that, smell-wise, remembers EVERYTHING. I kid you not, I clean this seat every day because of how bad it can smell. If my cat jumps up on it, it smells like kitty litter (bad girl!). If I fart on it, it smells like farts. If I drop a cheeto between my legs IT SMELLS LIKE CHEETOS. And these smells linger indefinitely. If you don't regularly clean this chair, it will start to smell like everything you've ever sat on.3. HeatIf you're a human being and sweat when you're hot, ohhh boy, are you in for a treat. The adhesive properties of this faux-leather seat are honestly impressive. I haven't done this but I 100% believe if you sat on this chair naked for 20 seconds, you could pick it up with you and walk away with it stuck to your back.In the winter it was fine, honestly. But once summer hit and I stared wearing shorts again and, Gods forbid, I didn't wear a shirt?! Game. Over. I was sitting upright like Queen Elizabeth all on my own in a desperate attempt to keep my back away from my own chair. And, without a comfortable black, you're sitting on a freaking stool. So be ready to crank the AC lest you become part of the chair like old Boostrap Bill stuck on the side of The Flying DutchmanIN CONCLUSION: It's fine. Do I miss my old chair that completely broke? Yeah. Does this one look good? Yeah! Does it support my back and keep me 100% comfortable? NOPE. Should we, as a society, rethink chairs like this? Yes, I think so."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States June 24, 2020', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Experience Comfort and Style with the Homall Gaming Chair', 'author': 'Phil Salvo', 'rating': 4, 'content': ""I recently purchased the Homall Gaming Chair, and I must say that it has exceeded my expectations in terms of comfort, style, and functionality.

WORTH BUYING.', 'author': 'loulou Snyder', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'The order came in a very timely manner. The package arrived along with another item I bought from another seller. Packages arrive at the same time and both had some wet spots on it (possibly oil). But when I inspected the box for this chair, it is well packed and all items have plastic seals and bags. So it was intact and clean. Everything was labelled correctly and they even have a cute little tool (tiny and cute screwdiver).The assembly is easy. At first I thought there were no instructions and I am missing items. But when I started opening all the bags, intending to ""figure it out"", I found the instruction sheet in the back of the seat piece. AND ITIS VERY CLEAR. Short, clear and precise. I started from the bottom and worked my way up. Total time: 2 hours and 40 mins. This is because at the end of it, attaching the arm rest and back piece, I realized I mis-understood the manual. It said the other way around. So I had to un-screw it and switch it.The only thing I have to mention is when you start putting the back and arm pieces, lean it on another chair if you are alone. It will fall if you do not have anyone with you. It is heavy and it won\'t hold in place if you do not either lean it on a chair or table OR if you do not lay the whoe thing down.In terms of quality, as I assembled it, it was the little things. The metal work is a bit mushy BUT, the metal is thick. It is sturdy enough to serve it\'s purpose. The arm rest has some small scratches on the insides and by the parts where you put your nails and screws in (right round the hole areas and eyon) it. BUT, You won\'t see it and specifically look for it when you sit here, right? It is unnoticable if you do not specifically look and put your hands in smooth test for it. The leather stitching is a little too tight when I inspected it though, as if the fabric was extended a little too much. But it is okay after everything was assembled. It was just perfect and soft looking afterwards. Just do not pull the fabric or rub on it.The seat and cushion though are SO SOFT AND COMFORTABLE! The chair itself was the perfect size for me. I am 4\'11 and 122 lbs. It is firm and cushy for me. The back support was very ""pocky"" for my neck and spine. After working for an hour or so my back, neck and spine gets intense and I lean back to a very pocky chair that eases my neck and back of my shoulders. The spin is stable too and the roll is easy and smooth, even with my 2"" carpet.But I always recommend everyone to wipe the whole thing up. Just to make sure the leather and the whole chair itself is clean. I think this will last a long time for me. :DIt is pretty. It is comfortable. And it serves it\'s purpose. I think for the price I got it for, IT IS 100% SATISFACTORY.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 15, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Definity Worth the Price', 'author': 'Terri', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Needed a new office chair so I tried this one.

Mason', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'Needed an office desk chair to work from home in. Since I would be working 8 plus hours a day, I wanted a comfortable chair. I also wanted a chair that was sturdy and had a metal wheelbase. This chair was one of the few in the range I wanted to work within that has a metal wheelbase. It’s an attractive piece. Also, the weigh capacity for this chair is approximately 300 lbs. I’m around 225 lbs, which was another reason, I went with this chair, I wanted something I knew would support my weight. I just finished assembling the chair and have only sat in it for a few minutes. Here is my early review. I would have given a higher rating if it weren’t for some minor blemishes in the appearance I spotted immediately out of the box. First, the paint had several scratch marks on one of the arms. There was a dark mark on the bottom seat cushion that did not easily rub off with a spit rub. I’m not sure if it is a mark or tiny tear, but I decided not to mess with it too much and potentially make it worse. The other arm of the chair, which the arms are made of a hard plastic (for some reason not metal), had a gouge in it and was split about a half of an inch or so. Probably damaged in shipping, though package looked undamaged. As far as the assembly of the chair, I did not find it very difficult. I completely assembled in approximately 20 minutes by myself. Assembly tip: Screw in screws prior to assembling arms and back cushion. Some of the material from the cushions slightly cover holes. Also, do not tighten screws before arms and back cushion are all attached. I would advise to lifting arms up (if laying cushion on its side, so screws go all the way down into the holes straight. Tighten screws while lifting up on the arms to ensure they go in straight. If you have put together a desk, bookcase or chair before, you should not have a problem with this chair. My final point of this review is in regards to the comfort of this chair. Again, I have only sat in it for a few minutes and I will update this review later if it becomes necessary. However, as of this writing, I am fairly pleased with the comfort of this chair. It also feels pretty darn sturdy! At my size, it doesn’t feel overwhelmed and appears to be able to support someone much larger. While sitting, there’s at least 3 to 4 inches of room on both sides of me. I do not feel restricted at all. Furthermore, with the back of the chair in locked position, in my opinion, there is very good support. Nothing feels uncomfortable. My only being picky issue would be the cushioning on the arm rests could be thicker and softer; but it’s nothing major. Quite frankly, this chair feels better than my office chair where I work (which I’m sure is a more expensive chair). In conclusion, in an early review, I’d like to give a glowing report, but the minor blemishes immediately out the box, annoyed me pretty quickly. However, the relatively easy assembly, combined with the sturdiness and comfort allows me to recommend this product at this time.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States July 27, 2019', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars A Great Chair', 'author': 'Rick', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""Had a few problem's at first but their support team is the best I've had the pleasure to work with.

I read the reviews and was hesitant, but went through with the purchase.Assembly was easy and took me about 30 minutes from cutting the box open. ---The legs seam solid and sturdy; When assembling them the legs were tight and stiff before screwing in, so it seems like a solid base. ---Decent quality wheels (I\'m on low-mid height carpet, can\'t comment on wood/vinyl/tile noise). --- the plastic arms do seem thick and solid enough, but I could see how, over time, outwards pressure could make them snap. That\'s not how I sit, so no issue for me. --- I saw a few pictures of the metal under the seat breaking, but it seams thick enough for me. If you\'re pushing that 300 lb limit, maybe it\'ll go over time. I\'m only 160 lb. --- no squeaking or any sort of noise when moving around. --- Initial thoughts on comfort: the chair feels and is shaped comfortably. I\'m 6\'2"" and did not expect to be able to rest my head back. I can\'t, as expected. Cushions are somewhat stiff (expected when new), but still very comfortable. I know it will break in some over time. Arm padding is nice, but I think it could be a tad bit thicker. Mine don\'t look as this as they do in the photos.overall, very happy right off the bat. Besides one indentation in the leather (which will come out in a little time), no damage or broken pieces at all. I will update this review in the future, once I\'ve actually put some use into the chair. -Would recommend for this price range, based off my initial thoughts.(2 MONTHS OF USE) - I\'ve had the chair for just over 2 months. After 1 month, I could see the imprints of the springs coming through the padding of the seat. Still can\'t really feel the springs, so it\'s not an issue ""yet"". The arm padding, like I said, is thin...so now where my elbows commonly rest has completely indented the padding. Basically no padding left for my elbows. Other than that, it\'s still a great chair. Nothing has broken, chair is still silent and I\'m still happy with it. The padding could be better, but I\'ll probably just get a new seat pad eventually (if I start feeling the springs)......

Nothing serious but, still, it arrived cracked. I pushed it back in place which at least hides the flaw. The back rest fabric seems really thin, but not uncomfortable. The seat cushion is pretty comfy, but I\'m wondering how long before it flattens out. The arm rests are a little low for my tastes (~7.5"" above the seat), but not a big deal and still pretty comfy. The locking mechanism to recline or not recline is functional, though I wouldn\'t lean back too far (for reference, I\'m 5\'9""/145 lbs). I also use this chair over carpet, it should be noted, so the wheels are going to be more stable/secure for me than for someone using this over hardwood or tile.In terms of construction, it was simple enough to put together. Took me less than an hour with a relatively easy-to-understand pictorial guide. All parts were included with a few marked as spares, just in case, which was nice. A broken piece (pictured) was loose somewhere in the box, which worried me at first, but it turned out I didn\'t need it for anything. When adding the wheels, no screws were needed as I just needed to push them in place. At first, I questioned the stability of that, but it seems they work well regardless.Overall, setup was simple enough, and the chair itself, though on the cheap end, does its job for simple usage and is pretty comfy. I\'m able to recline back and prop my feet up when I\'m just relaxing or reading, and I\'ve even power napped in this chair once so far.

So, firstly - this chair is hard to build if you haven’t built something like this before, and the instructions are a little confusing, so be warned. The wheels do not just “pop in”; I spent maybe 30 minutes trying to figure out what I was doing wrong before someone came to help me and they decided to hammer in the wheels.WITH THAT BEING SAID - this chair is amazing for the price. It’s comfortable (not SUPER comfortable but I went from sitting on a wood-and-metal accent chair for a year to this so obviously this feels amazing to me) and offers great back support! Plus it’s bright neon pink - I thought the colors would end up being duller than the picture but I was very wrong. I’m happy to say that the pink chair looks EXACTLY the same as the stock photo. It also has adjustable height and tilts back, if you’re interested in that.The only real downside is that the white plastic gets scratched / nicked easily, but honestly for a cute hot pink $80 chair I can live with that.If anything changes I’ll update; I only just got this chair yesterday so I can’t be sure how long it will hold up.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 23, 2021', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '3.0 out of 5 stars Okay Chair', 'author': 'Michelle', 'rating': 3, 'content': 'The media could not be loaded. I mainly got the chair for its looks and price value. The design and color are really nice, but I can\'t say the same for the design in terms of assemblage. The instructions were very clear, no issues there, but the actual assembling was pretty painful. Make sure to have another set of hands and something to hammer with. I managed to put 3/5 of the wheels in with my bare hands, but the last 2 were actually impossible, had to hammer them in so be prepared. The hammering wasn\'t so bad, make sure you hit the black part and not the wheels or it\'ll get destroyed. The painful part was the screwing. None of the screw holes lined up and I needed an extra pair of hands to push and hold them together to line up.As per the picture, the design of the holes is terrible. Why put a thinner oval shape to put the screw through when the hole is a circle. The screw didn\'t fit and if you force it, it\'ll destroy the plastic handle. That\'s why they gave a washer I guess, but when the holes already don\'t line up, putting a washer that prevents vision of where you\'re screwing made the process extremely difficult. You can assemble it given some time, but it was really unnecessarily difficult for no reason. I have assembled more complicated office chairs in less time.In terms of comfort, the chair is okay. The cushion isn\'t super plush, but it does offer support and you can easily put a cushion on top. The seat itself isn\'t too big if you like to sit criss-cross, but it still works somewhat for me with my knees protruding (5\'3"", 120lb) Other than that, the office chair works well.Update: I have come back a year later of using this chair to just say it\'s not a comfortable chair and I wish I have invested in a better chair for comfort. If you plan to sit on it often, it will definitely give you back pain in the long run and have you feel stiff after long hours on it. Maybe it just isn’t catered to my sitting positions as it doesn’t support the right areas for me.

The biggest change was the lumbar support as I never had one before and I'm still getting used to it. As a reference, I am 6' tall and weigh about 200 pounds, so chair size was a concern for me when I did my shopping for a replacement. This chair seems a little small for a larger person BUT I sat in only one other chair for years so this may be an issue I just need to get used to. New shoes can feel odd at first too. I do agree the lumbar support seems to push a person forward and does somewhat restrict the length of the chair seat - about 3 inches of my legs, at my knees, do hang over without support but so far I have not experienced any discomfort. I have learned to sit flush against the seat back (VS slouching) which also maximizes use of the lumbar support which feels good but also odd as I never had the support before. Assembly was pretty easy - always a challenge to add the arms when doing it alone, but I managed. Everything else was VERY easy, and the instructions were helpful and provided enough information. The leather also seems of good quality but only time will tell. I do use the chair every day but never for more than about an hour at a time, but several times a day. The color is also nice - pleasant and nicer than bright white. I would suggest to Amazon however, that they increase the height of the seat back for us taller folk - right now it only comes to about my shoulders because I do not slouch, so resting my head against the back is impossible unless I slide my butt forward, which then offsets the use of the lumbar support. Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase and have no regrets."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 20, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars So comfortable and supportive!', 'author': 'A User', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'This is a great chair to sit in for my work all day.

The star ratings are based on my first impressions and I'll update this review after I've had a chance to live with this chair for a while.So far, it's fairly impressive. It was boxed well and the unpacking simple. The instructions were clear (assuming a person is able to follow pictures that show how to assemble a thing). The necessary hardware was easily identified. The only bump in the road for me was that the instructions show a screwdriver-type tool to tighten the screws but the actual tool provided was an Allen wrench. I have arthritis in my hands so I would have preferred the tool that was shown. Not a reason to prevent someone from purchasing this chair, just my personal preference. It took me about 15 minutes to assemble the chair.It looks great! The floor in my office is ceramic tile and the wheels roll effortlessly over that surface. I also tried it over tight pile carpet. Rolled easily on that service as well. The seat is well padded as is the seatback. I'm 6', 220 lbs. The lumbar support feels very good and hits my lower back in the perfect spot for me. The arms swing up and down very smoothly. The controls for positioning the chair up and down and tilting the back takes some getting used to but once mastered (took about 30 seconds) work well.I sit at my desk several hours throughout the day. I'll be looking to see how well everything holds up in the coming weeks and will revisit this initial review. So far, it's yet another Amazon Essential item that appears to be an excellent value.UPDATE OCTOBER 14, 2020: Three weeks in and I'm very happy with this chair. The seat has now conformed to my butt and the back support continues to be excellent. I actually spend a lot more time watching TV in this chair than I did with my previous office chair. The only thing that will remain uncertain for a while is how long the bonded leather lasts. Not expecting a problem though as Amazon Essential stuff is pretty good.UPDATE: FEBRUARY 8, 2021 - Recent events have me sitting at my computer for 6-8 hours a day.

Needed something for the bedroom desk, so did a lot of looking on Amazon before picking the AmazonCommercial Ergonomic High-Back chair. Liked the color, liked the look, like the way the arms can get out of the way. All important for where the chair was going to be placed. As I read all the reviews I noticed many folks either loved it, or seemed to hate it. Thought I\'d give it a shot. I\'m about 5\' 8"" and about 150lbs. Currently using a Lazy Boy Big and Tall chair at the upstairs desk, so figured it may not work. 275 pound weight limit keeps one of the family members out of this one. The chair came a couple of days late (USPS), but no big deal. The box was in good shape and the contents were clean and perfect. Read in the reviews it was easy to put together, and it really is super easy. One person job, just needed wife for a few minutes to help line up the back of the chair in the last step. You just have to keep in mind what is in the manual, DO NOT TIGHTEN ALL THE SCREWS UNTIL IT IS PUT TOGETHER. Getting the holes lined up, with the arms loose was not a problem at all. Solid chair since it is metal and not cheap plastic. Think it will last awhile. Another reviewer noted she got a couple of greasy spots on the material from the hardware, so I kept that in mind while putting it together and it stayed clean. Used plastic disposable gloves to handle the bottom parts and screws.The only other thing to note is probably why some folks don\'t like the chair. It has big time low back support, almost too much support. For me it\'s fine, for some it might be a bit much. Otherwise, it is a really comfortable chair for sitting long periods of time. And, it really looks great. Again, perfect for the bedroom desk. Would buy it again. (might order one for a brother-in-law who needs really good low back support!)

But in just a couple of years the padding wore out, the ""leather"" started to flake off, and the gas cylinder started to fail.I decided to spend a little more money this time and bought this chair based on reviews about the padding. Naturally when it was delivered I got super busy with some other life events and didn\'t even assemble it until the return window had closed. That\'s on me. But I wasn\'t too worried about it given the reviews and the higher price tier.Assembled it tonight and the cushioning is quite good and seems like it will last. Just two problems. One is that it has a short gas cylinder which sits very low in the wheel assembly, and it simply cannot be adjusted tall enough. Two is that it has a disturbing side-to-side wobble.I had a spare replacement cylinder I originally bought for the gaming chair, then decided the other parts were failing too so I never used it. I tried that one but it doesn\'t fit correctly, i.e. the lever mechanism won\'t make it go up and down. So the cylinder on this chair is not only short, it\'s non-standard and cannot be replaced should it fail.I hate buying office chairs because there are a million models all competing and all cutting corners to compete. No one buying chairs has any hope of picking out better models, so better models never have a chance in the market. My old one used cheap padding, cheap leather, and a cheap cylinder. This one seems to use better padding and leather, but literally short changed me with a short, non-standard cylinder. How do companies mess up this badly? Literally another inch of travel would be fine. Heck, from what I can see of the wheel assembly, a better hole would keep the cylinder sitting higher and fix the wobble.I am very disappointed and wish I could return it.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 30, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '3.0 out of 5 stars Beautiful Chair but Not High Enough', 'author': 'stuchols', 'rating': 3, 'content': 'I ordered this chair as a deal of the day.

While it may appeal to those on a tight budget, my experience with this chair has left me unsatisfied with its overall quality.On the positive side, the chair boasts an ergonomic design with adjustable headrest, lumbar support, tilt function, and swivel rolling features. These adjustable elements offer flexibility for finding a comfortable sitting position and provide essential support during long hours of work.However, the main issue lies in the comfort level, particularly for users over 150lbs. The seat cushion bottoms out too quickly, leading to discomfort and inadequate support for heavier individuals. This limitation significantly impacts the overall comfort and usability of the chair, making it unsuitable for extended periods of use.Furthermore, despite its budget-friendly price, the chair\'s build quality and durability leave much to be desired. It did not withstand regular use for an extended period and showed signs of wear and tear sooner than expected. The overall construction felt flimsy and lacking in robustness.While the low cost may be appealing, it\'s important to consider the trade-offs in terms of comfort and longevity. As the saying goes, ""You get what you pay for,"" and the SMUG Ergonomic Mesh Office Chair is a prime example of a budget option that sacrifices comfort and durability for affordability.In conclusion, the SMUG Ergonomic Mesh Office Chair may be an economical choice, but its lack of comfort, particularly for users over 150lbs, and its subpar durability make it a less-than-ideal option for daily use. If you prioritize comfort and long-lasting support, investing in a higher-quality chair may be a better choice in the long run.Edit: After initially writing my review, their customer support team reached out to me in an effort to provide a solution to my issue, I am very pleased with the solution I received and this level of customer service is commendable.

I used another chair to hold the cushion in place while I screwed in the bolts on the underside of the cushion.Once assembled, I noticed a slight unevenness of the hand rests which leads to unevenness of the seat back in relation to the seat cushion. The hand rests don't appear to be aligned/parallel. The unevenness appears to be due to the location of the screw hole positions under the seat cushion. The 2 sets of screw hole positions are not aligned for both hand rests.It's very slight but is noticeable when you look at the chair carefully. Thankfully, I don't think I feel the unevenness when I sit on it.The plastic casters don't move very smoothly. I notice they don't respond to a change in direction fast enough so I can feel the slight tug when trying to move the chair from one location to another.

What wasn\'t so easy to deal with, however, was that the holes *barely* lined up, and every one was crooked, so getting the thing assembled was a nightmare and a half. Solidly would have had an easier time assembling Ikea furniture, it was *that* sort of project, with generally poor instructions and the like. While this was a source of frustration unending for about four hours the night it showed up, as well as four hours where even a sailor would blush if they walked in my front door, it eventually got there. Now, I excused this as ""bulk manufactured goods"" issues and ""only $150 on Amazon for something \'nice\' that landed on the cheaper end of the category"" issues, and was just going to leave it at that. Nothing to write home about. And then it was just one thing after the other with this thing.Leaned to the left a bit when it was sitting there, but not enough to notice unless you were looking at it from the back and really looking, which got accentuated of you sat in it but, again, it was only really noticeable when you looked at the back.The instructions say to tighten the bolts/screws every six(6) months. It didn\'t last last that long. It doesn\'t matter though, as we had to bust out the her key and tighten them every *two weeks*.

I wasn\'t disappointed. The chair was very easy to assemble, even by myself. I didn\'t have any issues with assembly, and I didn\'t look at the instructions once until after I had finished to confirm I had assembled it correctly. I just followed what seemed reasonable given the number of bolts for a given portion of the assembly. Take this with a bit of a grain of salt, as I have a degree in mechanical engineering and am no stranger to the nuances of product design and development. The overall construction of the chair is well designed from a visual standpoint. The chair is relatively comfortable, albeit a little stiff on the cushioning. I\'m a little on the leaner side, so I find the space between the arm rests to be adequate, but the arm rests are a little high for me (but I do have longer arms than average). I\'m somewhat tall (6\'4"") but the chair\'s height accommodates my dimensions rather well. The construction of the chair is a little lacking in the hidden regions, though. The stitching in the cushioning seems adequate and moderately well done, but the staples holding the underside together is a bit less than desirable and shows the build quality. The biggest gripe I have about the chair is the lack of stiffness in the mechanical components of the chair, beneath the seat. They\'ve been engineered to be on the less expensive side so they provide more flexure than I would have liked, or what I would have personally specified if I had designed it up. The chair wobbles from side to side with very little leaning in the chair. It also clunks a little bit when I lean to the left, just putting my weight on the arm rest as I would normally do when reading something while resting my head on my hand. It doesn\'t do this when I lean to the right. I\'ve been very cautious to ensure that all the fasters were adequately torqued to ensure proper tension on the bolts without stripping, so I\'m confident its not loose fasteners that are slipping, but there\'s somewhere else in the tilt assembly that its not very tight. The high flexure area could also stem from the wood they used for the seat core, rather than stiffening it with a piece of metal, but without knowing I\'m only guessing. I can see they\'ve engineered this to barely meet the minimum requirements of tolerance and meet the regime of acceptability where those looking for a cheap chair will tolerate it, but those looking for more stiffness and build quality will opt for a more expensive chair. The single pin that holds the two tilt brackets together is a bit thin and ideally would have been a bit larger in diameter, with a minimal impact to the end item price. Another thing that would have stiffened things up quite a bit would have been using 14ga steel for the tilt brackets, rather than the 16ga that they used. it would have cost an extra dollar or two in material cost, but would have meant a very different end user experience I think. Additionally, the cost of the extra hardware in the hardware kit would have been much more aptly put toward some lock washers rather than relying on the locking features on the underface of the button head socket head screws provided. The chair does ok, it just shows that it could have reached a little higher for minimal cost. I would have gladly paid an extra $50 for a more sturdy tilt bracket assembly or upgraded piston, if it meant it felt a lot stiffer than it does now. As it stands, it feels super loose and wobbly when I sit in the chair (and I\'m not that big, I\'m tall, but I\'m barely 200 lbs soaking wet). Brand new, it feels like I\'ve had it for something like 5 years with the amount of wobble that\'s in it. But, I can\'t complain much, I did go for a budget chair after all.3-month update: still moderately comfortable, still clunking when I lean, still super wobbly (most of the the wobble comes from the gas cylinder). The arm rest foam (inside the fabric) has largely lost it\'s resilience. I would have put twice the padding on the arm rests I think or just made it more dense. As it is my elbows feel bruised from them when I spend any substantial amount of time resting my elbows on them from how hard they feel. All in all, still an inexpensive, lower-quality chair with a lot of corners cut in manufacturing.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 6, 2021', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Easy to assemble', 'author': 'HALL15', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Super comfortable and easy to assemble !!

The chair was only used 2-4 hours a day, 4 days a week, in a home office setting.Finally, after about 6 months of the base bending and screws backing out, the wooden structure of the seat (that attaches to the base) began to splinter. That ended the chair\'s usefulness, and it was replaced before someone was injured.Overall, I feel a chair that doesn\'t last a year with light adult use should get 0 stars.However, the material, stitching, and aesthetics were really top notch.So, it lookes really good - you just can\'t actually use it.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 29, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '3.0 out of 5 stars Easy to assemble, but hard to stay comfortable.', 'author': 'Thomas C.', 'rating': 3, 'content': 'This review is written after about one (1) year of regular daily use for my work-from-home job (approx. 8-12 hrs/day). To help with context, I\'m an average height-weight (5\'10"", 130-ish lbs).Overall: A decent product for the price point. It doesn\'t make noise when you shift your weight, and the parts haven\'t fallen off yet. You can sit in, recline, and raise the height; it performs its chair-ly duties.Buy this if you need a good general-use chair to match the price point, but not if you sit for long periods and don\'t want to sit on a cushion, or you\'re on the slim side and want to sit up straight while also supporting your back.Arms: You can lift/lower the arms to get them out of the way, like airplane seats, but that\'s it. You cannot adjust their height when lowered, nor how wide they are (i.e., horizontally, how close/far from your body). I didn\'t realize how helpful this was until I didn\'t have it anymore. The padding is very thin -- if you lean heavily on your forearm or elbow, I recommend getting some additional cushioning or wrap to cover it.Height adjustment: The chair height itself adjusts fine. After >1 year of use, the piston doesn\'t show signs of wear or make noise, and the chair stays raised instead of slowly lowering itself throughout the day.Seat: This thing is perfect for Texas-sized butts, even with the arms down! It\'s large enough to sit in cross-legged (think yogi-style). That\'s where the pros stop. The cushion wore out fast, and it could have been more cushiony to begin with. Luckily I don\'t feel screws, plastic, sharp parts, etc., poking up, and cosmetically, it still looks fine. But MAN, will your tailbone hurt after a while (especially if, like me, you were not blessed with a big ol\' dump trunk). Also, the seat is pretty deep and cannot be adjusted. To sit up straight/ergonomically correct, I need to put a pillow behind my back to keep my knees forward of the seat edge. If you\'re of small stature and want to sit up straight but also have your back supported, look for a chair with a smaller seat and/or one that you can adjust here.Chairback: The chair does recline back and forth, but you cannot lock it into a reclined position. The only adjustment is for how much force is needed to make it recline. The curvature doesn\'t do much for lumbar support, but I\'m also a skinny guy and can\'t sit in it properly due to the seat size issue (above), so I\'m sure that plays into my comfort.Durability: No broken parts yet. The wheels still work fine (I have a plank wood floor and use a chair mat to avoid floor damage and wear and tear to the wheels). The pleather-like covering has held up and doesn\'t have permanent folds or creases.

I would have gone over budget if I thought there was one better based on reviews and video reviews, features and price. I don\'t have very much experience with office chairs, so I let others with supposed experience and knowledge help me make a choice. Also, I think spending over $399 on a home office chair is quite possibly the definition of foolishness. So, with that out of the way, I find this chair to have mostly quality components. The most notable exception are the wheels which are a hard plastic which are horrible on our brick floors, so I replaced them with the ""original rollerblade style office chair casters from Oasis"". Those wheels are great and they fixed the wheel complaint for an additional thirty bucks. The seat is firm, which is great, but it isn\'t really ergonomic i.e. it lacks form, but it is wide and comfortable - I\'m 6\' and 210 pounds and over sixty. The multiple adjustments were a big selling point for me. They all work fine and feel like they will last. I especially wanted the adjustment that allows the seat to slide forward and back which isn\'t available on most office chairs in this price range, and it works fine. I was also hesitant to purchase a chair without at least a 300 pound rating because I would assume anything less would be cheaply made, and this chair feels solid and supportive. Assembly instructions are great, but it isn\'t real easy to accomplish without an extra set of hands, so keep that in mind. Given my lack of experience with office chairs, how can I give it an accurate rating? I think four stars is fair, but if it came with rollerblade style wheels (come on Colamy, better wheels wouldn\'t add much to the cost) and the seat was more ergonomic, I\'m sure it would be a five star chair in all reviews.

I search through the other reviews and found that using an Allen wrench not supplied, I loosened the screws on the inside of the lumbar handle mechanism and it works great. The directions failed to mention lumbar support movement at all in the three page booklet that came in the box.

Even though the outside of the box looked a tad rough, everything inside was perfectly protected. - Super easy to put together (I did it by myself in less than 15 minutes) - Comfortable to sit upright in - Rolls smoothly (on chair mat and smooth surfaces) - Armrests offer plenty of adjustability. One of my ""must haves"" were armrest that could be rotated up and out of the way when not needed and most of the chairs I looked at (with headrest and footrest) don\'t allow that. It\'s really the main reason I ordered this chair over other even more expensive options. If you don\'t need that feature, then you have a lot more choices than I was limited to. The armrest can be swiveled to angle in, out, or just aligned straight ahead. They have a tactile click and seem to stay in place nicely (on day 1). They also have 4 lockable height positions that slide up and away. this means that the higher they are the further forward they are (the opposite of ideally how they\'d be). This is an understandable issue with the design and in my experience is the same for every chair design that allows for the armrests to swivel up and out of the way (the support is angled, thus the raising/lower of the height follows that same angle). Not a huge issue, and one I\'m used to from my older chairs, but be aware if you have short/long arms the armrest height impacts how far forward/backward it is (I end up with it at one of the middle heights and the armrest supports from about the middle of my forearm to my elbow, which leaves the rear half the armrest untouched). I wish someone would come up with a better design that allowed for the rotate out of the way I like but also allowed for more of the armrest to be used by more of my arm. Oh well, it\'s super common to have this issue, so i don\'t fault this chair.Indifferent: - The chair is quite heavy, which is a good thing most of the time (it\'s only bad when carrying it up/down stairs or such) - The footrest could use a tad more padding (it\'s not mesh like the rest of the chair). It\'s 1/4"" of foam over plastic, covered in black fabric, and so it\'s not uber comfortable. It does tuck away wonderfully when not in use, which is why the user can\'t add more padding and it would require a design tweak by the manufacturer to allow for more padding height. The footrest does have a slight curve to it which helps slightly with comfort and is appreciated. - There\'s a lack of contour (curve) to the seat and back compared to my old $99 mesh chair. Over time maybe the fabric will stretch or loosen allowing more curve (my 5 year old chair\'s mesh never stretched, so the built-in curve remained the same from day one), but if it does that\'ll lead to problems in other ways. Just know that it feels much more flat across the seat and back than most other chairs (mesh or not) so there\'s no sense of cradling or hugging like a lot of other chairs provide. - The headrest isn\'t really adjustable in a meaningful way. It does move a little up/down and it rotates, however at 5\'-10"" tall I have to have it fully extended to work right so anyone taller is going to be disappointed. My wife at 5-6"" found it was OK at it\'s lowest setting, but we both agree anyone shorter would probably be better off not even installing it since it\'d just be uncomfortably in the way. Also, the rotation doesn\'t do anything, it\'s only comfortable in one position so that ""adjustment"" isn\'t really useful.Cons: - I wish the footrest could be extended 2""-3"" inches further (I\'m 5\'-10"" and it\'s uncomfortably short after more than 30 minutes or so of use because of where the edge cuts into the back of my calves). Also, it wobbles a fair amount and therefore seems cheap/flimsy, but time will tell how/if it holds up. - There\'s a surprising amount of bounce to everything. The seat when sitting down or standing up ins\'t bothersome, however the armrest and back wiggles and bounces annoyingly even when locked into position. Overall it just doesn\'t feel very solid and rather feels cheaper than ideal. That said, it\'s not a case of ""you get what you pay for"" since I have 2 different other office chairs (one $99 mesh mid-back, and one $149 cloth high-back) and both of those feel much more solid and don\'t feel as bouncy/cheap. - The lumbar is adjustable up/down but because it\'s so far away from the fabric I only feel it when it\'s at the highest position (and then it\'s too high to be at my ""lumbar"") where the fabric is closest. - The back only locks in 3 positions. It\'d be nice if it also locked in a very modestly reclined position (not straight upright, but less reclined than what\'s currently offered, since that\'s the most comfortable. - The tension is WAY too light! REALLY DISAPPOINTED in this and the tensioner barely adds any tension at all! If it was easy to return, I probably would just because of this issue alone. You can\'t really lean back a little because it just keeps going back until you reach the limit (which is looking up at the ceiling reclined). And I can\'t keep it locked in a slightly reclined position, because it only locks in 3 non-user selected positions. So you\'re left with either locking it in the upright position, or just never leaning back a little, unless you want to end up staring at the ceiling. Overall it makes the chair basically only usable in the 3 positions that the user has no control over.SUMMARY: A chair that out of the box looks good and is comfortable to sit upright in, in 3 positions predetermined by the manufacturer, NOT the user. I wouldn\'t recommend it to anyone outside the height range of 5\'-6"" to 5\'-10"" (5\'-9"" if the footrest is really important to you). As for comfort when not sitting upright or when shifting position, it lacks any sort of functional tensioner and therefore is pretty subpar and most other chairs would be better choices. I just got it so can\'t speak to longevity and how well it does/doesn\'t hold up over time.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States April 5, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '3.0 out of 5 stars Pretty decent, but far from perfect.', 'author': 'Eric Sellers', 'rating': 3, 'content': 'Overall, I do like the chair, but it has its issues.Likes:- Quite comfortable, even for long periods of time.- Looks nice.- 3 locking back rest positions.- Arm rests can be positioned in many ways or moved out of the way completely.Dislikes:- Headrest support isn\'t strong enough so it doesn\'t stay at the angles I\'d prefer and you can\'t tighten it. Needs a way to tighten to stay in place.- Arms are too easy to adjust, causing them to move when I go to get up or reposition, which is a bit annoying. Took some getting used to but now it\'s not a big deal but these adjustment features should be lockable or more secure.- Adjustable lumbar support is an absolute joke. It doesn\'t stay in place at all. I move it all the way up and it just goes back down after applying pressure to the support. Yet another feature that requires a way of locking to work properly.- Wheels are decent and look quite nice, but are nothing compared to nicer wheels. I purchased silent rubber wheels on Amazon and they\'re leaps and bounds better in functionality.- This chair seems to be made for taller people. I\'m 5\'8"" and when I have the seat at max height, my feet don\'t touch the ground when I sit all the way back. If you set the chair to recline, the seat angles up more, making it even harder to place your feet on the ground. I have a sit/stand desk so I just keep the chair and desk as low as possible when working.- The leg rest is nice to have but I only wish, AGAIN, that it was lockable. It slides in and out with ease, making repositioning in any way an annoying chore.Overall, I do think this is a really nice chair for the money. I don\'t hate it at all, but it comes with many design flaws.I\'d say research chairs of the same price point and take these pros and cons into consideration.

Lee', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'The chair isn’t quite the greatest thing since sliced bread (as the reviews make it out to be), but then, it’s not an awful chair. While it passes the eye candy test, the illustrated instructions may as well have been in Chinese, assembly definitely does not take 20 minutes (more like 1.5 hours after swapping pieces around over and over to figure out how the chair was supposed to be put together), and the chair is not nearly as cushy as one would hope for. That said, it is decently comfortable and has some cool features.The number one thing going for it is that it actually does provide excellent lower back support, and the massage function is a little gaudy and isn’t a trip to a spa house with a massage , but then it’s a nice little bonus. This is good for the lower back and it will make your chiropractor proud and your pain receptors quiet.Of course, with that lower back support, it feels a bit unusual, especially if one has not used a chair of this type before, as it feels as though there’s something sticking out and into your lower back. And as plush as the chair appears in the picture, it doesn’t quite translate into the soft squishy feeling that allows your lazy bum to rest. The faux leather is not really the most comfortable material, and is rather firm instead of malleable, though rest assured that you will not be sitting on aluminum or concrete. You will feel somewhat comfortable, maybe even fairly comfortable.A couple of additional features that are pretty neat are the gas pump that adjusts the height, and the ability for the chair to tilt back. In the reclined position, the chair most definitely multiplies its comfort level, and will be good for someone who wants to lean back when they’re reading, but seeks to avoid a situation where lying down on the couch would put you to sleep. Though the wheels on the chair were not at all as mobile as I had hoped, making it somewhat difficult to move the chair across my laminate floor.Now for the bad news. The illustrations have no words, the parts are not labeled (though they have code letters in the illustrated instructions), and they occasionally do not make any sense. For example, the left and right handles can easily be attached incorrectly because the instructions do not distinguish which side of the handle should be attached to the base. The wheels that attach to the bottom do not easily snap in, so it can fool you into wondering if there are other parts that should be holding the wheels into place. I tried pounding the wheel into the leg with a hammer and it still failed to go in, but eventually got them connected with the assistance of the strength in my biceps. Then, attaching the back part of the seat is a nightmare. The instructions have you squeeze it in between the handles, partially screw in the screws, then rotate the chair upwards to screw in the remaining screws, then finishing the project by tightening all the screws. The problem is that if you’re unlucky, the screws will fall out, the back part of the chair will fall, and then you might have to start all over again. Breaking one of these screws is probably a real possibility, though fortunately they seem tough, and the package comes with spares.If you’re a mechanical engineer or maybe even a carpenter, then assembling this thing will probably not be that hard. But then not everyone is an engineer or a carpenter. That being said, the final product is effective, and the value for what you get is acceptable, though it may come with an additional price in the form of putting the darn thing together.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States March 10, 2021', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Wonderful chair, horrible assembly', 'author': 'kenz', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I am very impressed by the quality and comfort of this chair.

The chair bottom support with the rolling wheels is metal so it is super sturdy and the casters are extremely smooth. I am very pleased with that. The mesh material that is on the seat, the back, and the headrest has so much bounce and strength at the same time that it gives an incredible and pleasurable sitting experience. The headrest is adjustable to go up and down and also to go forward and backward and I love that. The armrests are also adjustable to go straight forward or side to side and this is also great when I work with my mouse and my computer and I get arm fatigue.

The package came promptly and I proceeded to put it together. I have to say, I have never had such an easy time assembling a chair. The instructions had great graphics and instructions. The instructions were obviously designed by a native English speaker who knew what they were doing. I'm so tired of instructions put together by someone outside the country where you have to guess what to do next. The chair went together easily and quickly. I loved that all the parts and the holes actually aligned. I have had bad experiences in the past where I had to try and jury-rig things to fit right. Once it was complete I sat in it and it fit like a glove. I especially loved the lumbar support. A couple of the reasons why I chose this chair was because of the mesh back which allows for air circulation and the seat wasn't covered with fake leather which disintegrates after a couple of years. It is covered with a sturdy cloth material. When I first sat on it the seat felt rather stiff and hard, but now after having used it for several hours I find it to be comfortable and that it provides plenty of support.

But had I seen it at a store I would have quickly passed on it. But I\'ve decided to keep it rather than going through the effort to pack it all back up again and return it. I do predict that I\'ll have to replace it again after the 1-year Warranty expires.HERE’S MY ASSESSMENTS……………….FIRST IMPRESSIONSThe moment I opened the box there was a VERY strong chemical smell with the contents. I still proceeded with the assembly but then started getting a headache from the smell. Since it was almost completed, I went ahead and finished the setup. Then I worked with the chair a little but then put it aside for the evening. I also treated it with air freshener overnight. The next day the smell was greatly reduced but still noticeable after using one day. I do think it will eventually go away. And there was no headache on the second day. Adding this to provide you with a heads-up.HEADRESTThe Headrest swivels but I haven\'t found that to be useful in all Reclining options (Work & Learn, Relaxation, and Rest.) A design change is needed to provide the option to move the Headrest closer to the head and then allow it to swivel.For example, when in the Work & Learn setting it would be very nice to move the Headrest against your head without having to move your head backwards. Then you could be in that position while working or participating in an online meeting (on camera) without looking like you\'re napping. :)And it would be great when you\'re using either the Relaxation or Rest option because you could move the Headrest close enough toward your head to still watch a presentation on your computer monitor, watch TV, reading, etc. while you are in one of these reclining options.The work-around I found is to use a small pillow to fill the gap between the Headrest and your head. That is useful with the Relaxation or Rest options of the chair back. Not something I would ever use in the Work & Learn option when I\'m in a Video Call.LUMBAR SUPPORTA design change is needed to adjust the tension on the Lumbar Support. Without that adjustment it is only going to work with lighter-weight users.ARMRESTSIt is convenient to have the option to set the height of the user. But it would be very helpful if they were longer. When you are in the Relaxation or Rest option there is quite a gap between the Armrest and the back of the chair. That gap causes your arms to slide off the back of the armrest.HEIGHT OF CHAIRI\'m 6\'4"" and feel that the chair is too short. I searched for chairs for taller users and this one was included. And there were several other buyers who rated it as being a fit for my height. The manufacturer doesn\'t claim it is for taller users.CHAIR STRENGTHThe manufacturer does state the ""star base is sturdy and durable, with a weight capacity of up to 300 pounds."" Before purchasing this chair, I never caught that the manufacturer was isolating the weight capacity to just the ""star base"". After receiving the chair, I don\'t think other parts of the chair can handle that much weight over a long period of time. Overall, the chair just feels light-weight. The warranty is just 1 year and I haven\'t fully examined the fine print yet.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 16, 2024', 'is_verified': True}]"

However, my old chair that is pictured on the right is about 25 years old and no longer has any butt cushion. It quickly became painful to work in that chair all day. I have since moved to a new state and found a remote job I will be starting soon so I decided it was time to upgrade the chair. This is a decent chair if you are on a budget like I am and you are not hard on your stuff adding premature wear and tear. For me, it has good lumbar support which I needed, and more cush for the tush! I am a proportionate 5\'2"" female and about 125 to 130 pounds. The seat has just enough room for my butt but I don\'t think I would recommend this for larger people. I would look into sizing up to the big and tall chair. Take note of the seat and back size to know what would work best for you but this chair feels small yet good sized for me only because I was able to go by the measurements of my old chair. Might even be best for you to go into an office supply store to test out chair sizes for comfort before making a purchase. Sometimes I like to sit criss-cross applesauce and this chair has a very nice and smooth rocking motion after loosening the tight/loose knob for reclining and is so comfortable for me that I may fall asleep on the job and get fired. The back of the chair hits just above my neck so I am able to tilt my head back a bit to let it rest since my upper back and neck sometimes go numb after sitting for too long. Ugh, it\'s just so much fun getting older!!Assembling the chair was easy until I got to step 4 to put the back of the chair on. If you have another person to hold the chair back for you to align with the chair arm holes and screw in, then you should be OK, but since I had no one to help, I had to take the seat off and lay it down. I still struggled to align the back while the arms were attached to the seat so I removed the arms from the seat and attached them to the chair back and then aligned the seat with the arms and screwed them in. Once done, I inserted the completed assembled seat, chair back, and arm attachments back onto the wheels.

The middle of the chair, where the two main sections meet, is the worst area, and at this point it feels like there is basically no cushioning there at all. It looks like it will be plush but this is definitely low quality padding that will compress quickly. In fact my last cheap chair from Ikea lasted me well over 5 years before it got as uncomfortable as this one already is. The back feels supportive and I like the it's also got a fairly high back. If the chair will only get very occasional light use I'm sure it's good enough, but if you plan to sit in this daily I would not recommend."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 12, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Computer desk chair of my dreams', 'author': 'Patricia Greene', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I had recently moved and had to leave my beat-up computer chair behind.

This is not the best method to anchor the seatback and it usually inserts into a fixture or bracket on the seat bottom for a firm connection. Therefore I would not ride back in the chair too hard if you sit down and have a tendency to rare back a lot. Those armrests are only made of plastic that the bolts fit the seatback to.

Before I bought the office chair, I used one of the chairs that came with a dining room seat I've had for 20 years. No arrangement of pillows ever made that chair comfortable to work in for six or seven hours a day, five days a week. The office chair, however, is a game-changer both in terms of my physical comfort and my disposition (a physically comfortable worker is a happier worker). What's more, because the arms are collapsible, the chair slides right under the kitchen table that doubles as my desk. I have only one complaint about the chair: It's not leather, as advertised. It's a cheaper, less durable fabric. This means you have to be very careful about scratching it, puncturing it, even cleaning it (the instructions that come with it say this, too).

I used the tools pictured in the attached photo and it was fairly straight forward with a clear & easy to follow instruction manual.

Before purchasing the Winmore chair, I'd purchased 2 otherbrands which were more expensive, a bear to put together, bulky, movement was clunky and the chairs weren't uncomfortable.I decided to read reviews and theWinrise, though much less expensive, received pretty favorable reviews.The winrise was much easier to put together than other chairs I've purchased, the movement is light and smooth, and it's quite comfortable at a great pricepoint. The flip up arms are a plus but if I were to ask for oneenhancement, I'd ask that the chairs arms pull in toward the waist and out away from the waist, but it's more of a nice to have than a requirement.I've had the chair now for almost two months and I use it daily as I work from home appx 10 hours a day Monday - Friday.

While the chair fit him well, everything about it was wrong for me. The headrest was too high and pushed me forward, the back support did not align with my back and the rigid arms kept me too far away from the desk. After it had an unexplained “accident” I decided to replace it with something more suitable for me and at a reasonable price.I selected this chair because it had a cool mesh back (Arizona is hot!) and the arms were flexible. Frankly, I was surprised that I could easily assemble it myself so quickly. The first thing I noticed was how comfortable my back felt with the lumbar support. I could sit all the way back in the seat and my feet touched the floor (Yes, I’m short!) and I can raise the chair height appropriately. I’m also a little bit wide and there is ample room to sit comfortably on the soft seat. I have a mat over the carpet so it rolls easily. The best part is the arms that can be flipped up which allows me to get closer to my lower craft table and (with the arms up) the chair can roll right up to my desk to conserve space. It’s become a versatile piece of furniture that also gets used whenever extra seating is needed. I’ve spent hours either on my computer or working on crafts without a neck or backache. I couldn’t decide on which color so went with basic black. It cleans easily, but it currently has a slipcover to protect it from any Christmas craft messes.

I had it together in maybe ten minutes.Visually, the chair is aesthetically pleasing. It's a good looking chair. Functionally, it doesn't have many frills, but it's very comfortable. I can sit in it for several hours at a time without discomfort. It adjusts up and down in a good range, you can swing the arms out of the way, and there is a pocket on the back. I'm not sure if it's for additional cushioning or storage, but I keep the installation instructions back there just in case. That's it for frills, and for the price, that's just fine. I don't regret this chair, and it's already outlasted my previous one."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 19, 2023', 'is_verified': False}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars comfort/height', 'author': 'zapp', 'rating': 4, 'content': ""I usually won't write a review this soon.

You can adjust the height of your seat as well as recline back in the seat! My most favorite feature is the retractable footrest! Actually, that's how it was described in the listing, but you actually pull it out, then you fold it out! When I saw it said retractable I somehow imagined it would snap out & back in! ??? (LOL...Just the image I saw in my head when I read that!) But the feature itself is wonderful! I've been having a lot of issues with swelling in my feet, but I sit all day for work so this is very useful to me! It's got a hanger on the back for if you want to hang your coat, or maybe a sweater!This chair is the sturdiest computer/office/gaming chair I've ever seen! It's pretty heavy but it rolls great! I have mine sitting half on, half off an area rug... My old chair used to get stuck when rolling back to stand up! So far, I haven't had that problem with this chair! The arm rests do not flip up, although you can adjust the height & turn the angle of the armrests! Most people desire that feature so they can push it in under the desk & that is still possible for this chair!Last but not least, the seat (the part you sit your butt on) is very nice! Much better than the last one I had! It's firm to provide support, but also soft enough to be super comfy! I work 50 hours a week sitting at a desk so when I tell you it's comfy, believe me, I've tested it out enough to give you an honest answer!Well, in case you haven't noticed, I am in love with my new chair!

Go figure, it was a spare dining set chair that I used because I was too cheap to buy an actual office chair. On a hot Saturday morning, right after breakfast, I decided to go into my office, log onto my computer and email some people I don't particularly like.So I go in, plop down onto the cushion of my trusty old wooden kitchen table chair. However, as soon as my bagels make with the chair, I hear a (POP) and down I go. I didn't get hurt, because I'm kinda tubby and have enough cushion of my own to break the fall. But, now, I needed a chair--a REAL chair... AN OFFICE CHAIR!(Damn... Now I gotta spend money)So, there I was, looking around for the most economically-reasonable (okay, cheapest) chair to buy. I searched around several sites when I came across this one on Amazon. It took me two hours to decide to pry open my wallet and buy it. I'm livid because my wife wouldn't let me use another dining chair, I can't play Solitaire on either of my dual monitors, and I can't email my friends and tell them that they are no longer welcome at ANY of my cookouts because THEY eat more than ME. But moreover, I was PO'ed because I have to wait for my chair...But not too long...The chair actually came about four days later. I was coming home from work when I saw the box on my porch (*OH, JOY*). I jumped out my truck, scooped it up before any bad-assed neighborhood kids could steal it, took it straight back to my office and unpackaged it. I was actually kinda disappointed: the chair was a mass of plastic and cloth. It looked weak; I gave it about a week before I'd be on the floor again.It was easy to assemble, and once it was up, I figured--hell, it looks kinda nice. However, the true test would come with actual use (here come the buns).For the money I paid for it, this is a nice chair. It's comfortable and very sturdy. It rolls and swivels easily. Unlike my old kitchen chair, this one doesn't cut the circulation in my legs; I can sit at my computer and work, email anbd play games for hours without any pain,numbness or lower leg swelling.While this is a nice comfy chair, I gave it four stars for ergonomics because it's not very comfortable to sleep in.

It\'s a simple chair (which is all I wanted) and some spare nuts and bolts just in case I need them.Upon unboxing this chair, I grew worried at the size of the cushion. I thought it was going to be too small for me, but once it was fully assembled and I finally sat down in it, it fit me perfectly. I am 5\'1"" (155cm) and 100~ lbs (45kg), for reference. I don\'t think this would be a good choice for people who are average-adult sized or larger, but for me it will be just fine.My only major complaint with this chair is the assembly. I do appreciate that it came with a guide, a wrench, and the screws were packaged neatly, but there is no way I was assembling this by myself. The bottom half was simple enough -- attach the 5th leg, pop the wheels in, pop the pressure-valve-lifty-thing in the base. It gets difficult when it comes time to attach the seat of the chair to the back of the chair. I had to get my sister to help me hold it in place, it was impossible for me to do it with only one set of hands without misaligning parts.Also, the metal bit underneath the seat that attaches to the base was....sandy? Or dusty or something, like it had been kept outside with no packaging. I don\'t really care, no one sees that part anyway and all the other components were pristine. But it was strange to feel sand (or whatever) on my hands when I took that part out of the cardboard.As for the experience of sitting in this chair itself, it\'s nice. It supports my back well, which is great considering I have horrible posture and need any help I can get. I haven\'t sat in it for too long, because my desk still hasn\'t arrived yet, but it\'s very comfortable. Looks just like the picture, nothing too fancy, you get what you paid for.

You easily adjust the tension by the front knob that controls how hard you need to push back to adjust the back rest like most chairs that recline.Speaking of reclining, this chair reclines pretty far, and is very comfortable.The head rest you will need to fiddle with to make it custom fit for your head.

Putting the head rest on, while assembling the chair is the hardest part, and its quite easy to do.As some others have said, the seat mesh is a little ""scratchy"", but you get used to it.I have found that I like using a cushion on the seat for extended sitting sessions, but you may not need one. The mesh seat is quite comfortable, and sometimes I switch between using a cushion and sometimes not using one. You will have to see what works for you.One big reason I got this chair is the swing up arms. I prefer these type arms, since you can easily lift them up out of the way, where as other chairs you can\'t do this. This makes it easy to push in the chair very close to your desk, saving room.Customer Service. One word, OUTSTANDING!I have hard floors at home, and carpet at work. My work place bought me the same chair, so I bought one for home use. I emailed the company and asked about purchasing the roller type wheels for my home chair, and they offered me an additional set for the at work chair, which I didn\'t need. They were willing to ship me two sets for free! I declined the one for work, since its carpet and didn\'t need a set. Thats great customer service, which is rare now a days. Keep this in mind when shopping for a chair...there are lots out there, and this company stands behind their product.Assembly - standard for a chair like this, very easy to do, and they provide a simple video to watch. Maybe takes 10 minutes to put together, and you can do it yourself. If you have trouble lifting, you would need some assistance.Shipping - Chair comes very well packed in a sturdy box, no issues there.Quality - I did not have any issues with this chair. Very well put together.Chair options - It leans back pretty far, and with the included head rest, it is quite comfortable to lean back when you are tired for a quick rest, or even a quick, nap. (shhhh...don\'t tell the boss) You can lock the angle of the back to exactly where you want it, if you don\'t like having to push back to lean the back rest.So far I am quite happy with this chair. I have never had a full back mesh type chair, and think that this will last quite a while, even with daily use. I think you will be pleased with this purchase. While you may be able to find a similar chair for maybe a little less price, to me, the customer service you get with this purchase is really worth it. You know that they will stand behind your purchase and your being happy with your purchase of their product. I don\'t think you will be disappointed.*update*Its been 3 months since I purchased this chair and I can tell you 100% no issues with the chair at all. Its quite comfortable, and I would purchase another one, without hesitation. I can be sitting in this chair for long periods of time, with no issues. I do use a small seat cushion, just because I had it left from my previous chair, so might as well make use of it, but its not really needed for this chair. I am completely pleased with this purchase. No chair is perfect, but not being able to get into a chair and sit in it for yourself, shouldn\'t sway you from purchasing this. Its very comfortable, and even though I am 5\'4"", its perfect in size, and the head rest is great too. Easy to lean back when you are tired and take a quick nap.

After considerable time researching a replacement, I pulled the trigger on the GABRYLLY Ergonomic Mesh Office Chair for my work-from-home setup. As someone who spends long hours at the desk, I was on the hunt for a high-quality chair that would prioritize comfort, support, and functionality, while also allowing me to play guitar from the same piece of furniture. Let me tell you, this chair has exceeded my expectations on all fronts!First and foremost, the ergonomic design of this chair is exceptional. The high back provides excellent support for my entire spine, promoting proper posture and alleviating strain. I'm not a small person, so having a chair that fits my tall frame and weight was clearly of paramount concern. This chair holds up and hasn't shown any signs of stretching or failure. The breathable mesh material keeps me cool and comfortable throughout the day, even during extended periods of sitting. You can actually feel the breeze from underneath, which is a change from my old cloth-bottom chair that would get pretty warm in the summer months.The chair's adjustability options are impressive. The height can be easily adjusted, as can the pitch of the backrest. The armrests are also adjustable, which allows me to flip them back and out of the way for when I play my guitars. The reclining function is very nice, but I opt to keep mine set more upright all the time. As for the headrest, it is kind of the only piece of the chair that I don't find much use for. Unless you lean your whole body back into the chair and lay your head back, the headrest doesn't even come into play.Durability is a standout feature of this chair. The sturdy construction and high-quality materials make it feel solid and long-lasting, but without sacrificing comfort. I initially had the regular casters in the chair, but saw that others were able to contact the company and get a set of rollerblade wheels as a free upgrade. I did that as I am working on a tile floor. And while the regular casters were workable, the roller wheels are much more suited to the solid, but bumpy flooring my workspace is located in.Assembly was a breeze, thanks to the clear instructions and the included tools. Within minutes, I had the chair ready for use. Everything was very straightforward.In terms of customer service, GABRYLLY has been exceptional. They promptly addressed my inquiries and provided support. When requesting the wheel upgrade, they reached back out to me very quickly and answered all of my questions. The wheels were here to me in a matter of days. Very responsive support.I wholeheartedly recommend this chair to anyone in need of an upgrade. It's an affordable chair with the quality of a much higher price tag."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States June 28, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Awesome chair and excellent Customer Service', 'author': 'JoeyO', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Update 7-26-23Jennie and the after sales support from this company is bar none, one of the very best I\'ve ever come across since I\'ve been an Amazon Prime Member for over 15 years.Recently, the headrest broke by accident, so I emailed the company and they gladly accommodated my request for a replacement. Unfortunately, because of a new design in the chair itself, the headrest wouldn\'t work, as the backrest is different now.. I emailed Jennie and they very quickly are sending me a new backrest to make it all whole again.I couldn\'t be happier with the chair. It\'s made with great pride and the support team are always ready to make sure the customers are happy. I highly recommend this chair as it\'s both comfortable and well designed and if ever you need support, they are always ready to be of assistance in any way possible.Thank you Jennie and the rest of your staff for making things so easy to work with.++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++I\'ve spent the better part of two weeks in search of a good chair to replace a 10 year old dilapidated chair that\'s served me well over the years. I checked out so many chairs on Amazon, local stores and sites like Staples, Office Depot, and others. I even looked on Amazon for Gaming Chairs as they seemed like they would be comfortable. To my dismay didn\'t find one to my liking.Being an Amazon Prime Member for 14 years now, I continued my search on Amazon. That\'s when I stumbled upon this GABRYLLY Ergonomic Mesh Office Chair. I read all the reviews and at first was hesitant to purchase it online as was asking myself - \'Oh no! What if I don\'t like it, how will go about returning such a bulky chair?\'I took a leap of faith and went ahead and ordered it online, and was far less expensive than those I saw in local furniture stores and other websites. It arrived in two days as promised, and I was very excited to assemble it, and the first thing that I came to mind was: ""Oh boy, I wonder how long this was going to take me to put it together!""To my surprise and amazement, it literally took me more time to unbox and take out all of meticulous wrapping which was done to perfection; and assembling the chair was a breeze, just following along the detailed instructions that came with it. I had it done and rolling to my study in about 15 to 20 minutes tops.Upon sitting on the chair for the first time, I knew there and then that I made the right decision in purchasing this office chair. It\'s super comfortable and the ergonomic design was really to my liking. The headrest was so nice and can easily be adjusted in so many ways. I also like that the armrests can be lifted up and placed out of the way, so that you can roll the chair closer to the table and be in a more comfortable position when typing on the on my various computers :-)The adjustments you can do on the chair was also well though of and such a breeze. For example, I adjusted the tension of how easy it would be to lean back and rock back and forth.Folks, look no further!! This chair fits me to a T!! I am 6""2\' about 155 lbs and the GABRYLLY Ergonomic Mesh Office Chair is super comfortable and the manufacturer went to great length to build this quality chair and paid so much to details, such as the legs where you can place your feet is also testament of how much went into its design. Rotating and rolling back the chair are also very quiet and smooth.In conclusion, as you can see in the photos I\'ve posted, my study/computer room, is my \'Man Cave\' as my wife would call it and this chair was a perfect addition, and couldn\'t be happier.Congrats to those behind the scenes who paid such close attention to details, and made this chair very easy to assemble and extremely comfortable to use.Hope you find this review useful and thanks to all those who have posted their own reviews which helped me in my search for the perfect chair.Thanks and God Bless to all.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 10, 2022', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent Value', 'author': 'AW', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'I recently got around to assembling my chair and it was incredibly simple -- everything necessary comes with the chair, as promised. The holes, hardware and heavy plastics were all correctly drilled / machined and went together without any issues. I didn\'t even need to oil the screws, like I have to with most home assembly furniture I order.As a Hawaii resident, I\'m used to boxes from the mainland arriving torn open and battered like they owed someone money. My chair box was, indeed, quite battered and showed signs of having been kicked or shoved by several different peoples footwear before arriving and there were gouges in the corners where I assume it had been roughly shoved into and out of vehicles.The box is made of \'double layer\' and incredibly stiff cardboard, enough so that the interior layer was not damaged at all. The box is currently being requisitioned by my wife to provide shelter to local strays when the weather inevitably turns, as it always does. The product was in perfect condition. Pristine.The chair, once assembled, sits high enough my daughter (5\'6) can barely touch the floor with her toes at it\'s highest setting. The arm rests are satisfactory, but not especially comfortable, so I\'ll likely leave them folded up going forward, or look for a cushioned sleeve for them.The mesh material is coarse and isn\'t especially comfortable to lean back on without a shirt, which is a serious issue for people in tropical climates. In board shorts or pants the seat is comfortable and springy, but once again, if you\'re keen to wear short shorts or want to lounge around in your underwear in the evenings (or during mercilessly hot tropical afternoons), it\'s going to get very uncomfortable, very quickly. I\'d imagine it will be intolerable for ladies in similar states of undress.The head rest is a nice idea, but the arch of the chair makes using it a bit problematic without some very fine tuning. If you\'re tall enough (I\'m 6\'1 and it works, barely), you can use a kind of ""V"" setup (you\'ll understand when you look at it) to get it far enough out you can make use of it.If you\'re shorter, say... 5\'7 or under? You\'re probably not going to need to bother connecting it to the chair at all, due to the arch of the backrest and the design of the headrest.That said, it\'s an excellent value, especially on sale. The instructions are in a proper booklet, well-written and easy to follow. The warranty is in it\'s own stiff envelope. I was able to re-package the spare hardware and key-tools in the package in came in, to store in my cabinet. The construction is solid (remember to re-tighten after two weeks of use!) and feels very much comparable to the $1,400 chairs we have at the office, save for the mesh not being nearly as luxurious (or luxurious at all, being coarse plastic).I\'d recommend it for anyone looking for a solid office or gaming chair, but not if you\'re planning to spend a lot of time lounging around in it to watch videos or similar. If you\'re in a tropical climate, be aware that it will not accommodate your being in any state but properly dressed. If you\'re like me and spend most of your time at home wearing board shorts and nothing else, you\'re gonna wanna find a nice cover to throw over the back seat.I\'ve got one of my wife\'s airy sarongs thrown over the back to take advantage of the trade winds, while avoiding the scratchy mesh.I\'m quite happy with my purchase.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 3, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Superior product and superior customer service', 'author': 'Mark mayo', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I was expecting a lot when I ordered this chair. I was not disappointed!First, about the chair assembly:The assembly was quick and easy. Even for one with a very bad back, although I did have to be on the floor. I would have been on the floor no matter what chair I put together. I have assembled several office chairs over time. This one was, by far, the most enjoyable. The instructions were clear, and the illustrations were actually helpful. I have not been so fortunate with other chairs.Second, the chair itself:It is well made. Having been burned by other manufacturers, I inspected this as I was unpacking. I did not see any flaws. The parts are solid and well made. Some other chairs I have owned had to take some adjustments to be comfortable. This one was comfortable right out of the box. I weigh 220 (though I am planning on losing some weight), and it supported me without groaning. The headrest is incredibly adjustable about. I was able to find just the right position in no time. With most of the other chairs I have owned, the headrests were more ornamental than functional. One of the main reasons I bought this chair was for arms that swing up. That makes it extremely function for my guitar playing. I don’t have to purchase an extra chair: this one handles my office needs and my studio needs as well.Third is the customer service:I was skeptical of the other reviews that extolled the service. Trust the reviews. This customer service was responsive. Jennie was concise and helpful. It was a pleasure to work with her. Again, I have not had good experiences with other companies. I contacted them to inquire about the price of the roller blade wheels. Their reply was that the would send a set at no cost. As for the lumbar pillow that some reviews had mentioned, they were out of stock.If you can’t tell by now, I am an extremely satisfied customer.I would recommend this chair to anyone.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 23, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars My favorite office chair!!!', 'author': 'Casey Payton', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I originally bought one of these around 2021 and it was incredible! So extremely comfy, quick to put together and sturdy!!! My husband started working from home a little over a year ago so i sacrificed my beloved office chair for his comfort while he worked. Cuz you know.. he pays the mortgage and i needed him to happily and comfortably do so lol. But I was stuck with an old wobbly, no back office chair for about a year. I was searching for another office chair to finally get for myself and looked through some slightly cheaper options other than Gabrylly. No matter what I found, I kept coming back to this chair in my cart. I couldn’t find anything that compared to this chair and I already knew the quality of it because I had one!! I was going to get one of their cheaper models but NOPE! I added the exact same one to my cart and purchased it! And I’m so happy with my decision. It’s so worth the price point and I don’t think I’ll ever buy another office chair other than this one! I love how the seat is mesh so it doesn’t get dusty and funky from years of farting in it. The arm rests adjust to slide up and down and you can fold them up if you have a slightly shorter desk. The mechanisms for reclining and rocking and locking are so sturdy, I never feel unsafe when I lean back. And above all else, they have amazing customer service!! I went to active my warranty with them and they activated it AND sent me the upgraded wheels that work better on wood flooring! They’re very kind and they have a great product.

I’m a big guy, 260lbs, 6’3”, and this chair is quite comfortable and has held up very well. I didn’t want to review this chair too early as I wanted to have some time with it. To my surprise, this chair seems to punch up above its price range quite a bit. There’s a lot of value here when thinking of durability and comfort.I believe I’ve owned it for almost a year now and it’s pretty much exactly like it was when I first bought it. The netting on the seat has sagged slightly, but it isn’t noticeable. I’m a guitar player and the fold back arms are SO convenient! The wheels still work like new, gas piston still goes up and down, and the recline adjuster works fine.The only issues I have with this chair are the recline adjustment isn’t that great. It seems like after some wear I can’t get the back to adjust completely forward anymore. The headrest is well made but I wish it angled forward a lot more so it would actually be useable without having to sit all the way back. These aren’t deal breakers at all though, just small nit picks.Overall, I’ve been very pleased. I feel this chair is a great value. I use it ever single day for long hours, work and play, and it’s always comfortable. I never get tired of sitting in this chair, and for a large man that’s saying a lot. The fact that this chair can hold up to my weight and still look great and be comfortable after almost a year is a great sign for its overall longevity. It really does look just like it did when I bought it besides the slight sag in the netting.Highly recommended! This chair will last!

This chair has addressed both readily; in particular, the front of the seat slopes off instead of coming to a hard lip so it doesn\'t dig into my legs when sitting. The ergonomics are excellent as the chair has various ways to customize the sit; the seat back is adjustable, letting you tilt it to where you like and lock it in place there (I don\'t like to sit bolt-upright, so I leaned it back one level). The headrest is also adjustable in two directions, so you can put that right where you like it as well, and even the arms can be adjusted to put them where you like when they\'re swiveled down.The mesh is supportive but has give to it. It\'s no memory foam, but that\'s not what I was looking for. It breathes well and doesn\'t stick in humid environments. It\'s rubberized and lightly rough to run your fingers over, but that roughness keeps you from slipping around; unless you plan to use it naked, it\'s fine. If you really don\'t like the feel of it on your butt, however, they\'ll send you a cushion—more on that in a sec. I also got the optional blade-style wheels (again more in a sec), which I ended up not using for now, because they don\'t play well with padded carpets, but which I think are perfect for shallow carpets, hard floors, or carpet protectors.The only issue I\'ve had with this chair is—and bear with me here—it absorbs farts like some sort of ass osmosis. It started to stink of butt real quick, and requires periodic maintenance; simple soap and water via rag works fine. I don\'t know what it is, but be aware that if you are a flatulent folk, you may need to address this. I brought this to their attention and they offered me a seat cushion, which brings me to the ""in a sec"":Probably the best thing about this chair is the customer service. When assembling the chair, I noticed in the instructions that they offer ""blade"" style wheels as an option (think rollerblades). Having never used such a thing on a chair, I decided to contact the provided email. Turns out I didn\'t have to—they ended up reaching out to me on their own anyway to ask how the chair was. When I inquired about the wheels to find out how much they\'d cost, the answer was nothing; they shipped the wheels to me for free, shipping and all. When I mentioned the issue with the mesh smell, they offered me a seat cushion as well, although I didn\'t take that offer because I like the feel of the seat as is and I can address the smell easily enough. From other reviews I\'ve seen they offer other accessories, and I believe them.You, savvy shopper who reads reviews, may be asking why they don\'t just include all of these accessories from the get-go. I haven\'t asked, but the chair is worth the price as-is, and not everyone will want or need every accessory, so including them with every chair would not only be unnecessary (and probably raise the price), but wasteful as well. Since they reach out to customers to offer these accessories, and include contact info to ask yourself in the instructions, I think this method is a good call.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States April 29, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great chair and great customer service!', 'author': 'Michael DeMaria', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I bought this chair because my previous ones were hurting my back. I decided to splurge and spend the money on this. It had other great reviews and customer support so I figured why not. The box came with everything you need and the assembly instructions were easy to understand. I reached out to the customer support to inquire on getting the back support and additional cushion that was referenced in other reviews. Customer service got back to me and are shipping both. We'll see how the cushion seat is. A lot of others have said it's superior to the mesh. Personally, if this product didn't have great customer support willing to send that out, this chair would be a 3.5 star, maybe a 4. The mesh seat is firm, but nice when you first sit in it. But after awhile, it starts to hurt your butt. So again, if just the mesh seat, not a 5 start product. The willingness from the seller to work with you on that though brings me to the 5 star review. The reclining capability is nice too. It's a little stiff at first but you get used to it. It goes back pretty far too which is nice. The head rest is adjustable which I think is a great feature. If you don't like it, it's easy to remove too. The arm rests adjust which I use constantly. Didn't know that was on this chair but it's definitely a welcome addition. I don't know how long the mesh seat back will last, hopefully a long time. It seems good quality and allows a lot of air flow. I'm a fan. In summation, the chair is a pretty solid product.

The packaging was adequate, consisting mostly of sheets of cardboard and components wrapped in thin bubble-wrap. Assembly instructions were clear, and I'm pretty handy with tools so not too difficult to put together. Keep in mind you will have some effort to get all the parts unwrapped, laid out, and assembled. I appreciate the T-handle Allen wrenches, vs the normal kit tools, and inclusion of extra screws in the package.After assembly, I found that the chair was a little difficult to roll on my floors, and sits a little too high for my legs. The assembly instructions said to contact the seller for support, and after letting them know my issues, they mailed me a set of rollerblade casters, and a shorter gas piston for the seat lift. They'd also mentioned that additional lumbar support is available and they mailed me a strap-on pillow for my back. It has a couple elastic bands to hold it on the chair.Installation of the casters was straightforward and I was able to swap them out by hand. The gas cylinder, on the other hand, gave me fits! The video clip included in the support email showed someone gently hitting the base with a mallet. I got my rubber mallet and after tipping the chair on its side, banged on the base for a while with no success. I eventually had to turn it upside down over a couple bins, then use some squeeze clamps and a wooden block to push against the bottom of the gas cylinder and was able to get that off. Separating the top of the gas cylinder piston from the bottom of the chair mechanism was a trial in patience. I hit the bottom of the chair with my mallet, I hit the piston on the sides to try to loosen it. I removed the seat mechanism from the seat, and hit that with the mallet. I put ice-packs around the junction, then hit it. I put the ice packs back, got everything cold, then took my heat gun to try to warm the seat steel and then hit it. I clamped the piston in my wood vise and tried to pry the bottom off with a crowbar (and blocks of wood to keep it from scratching). I tried a pipe wrench to twist the piston. Finally, I opened my vise jaws up, rested the seat mechanism across it and my bench, then took a hardwood stick, put it on the shoulder of the gas cylinder, and hit the top of the stick with a hammer. A few whacks on either side and it finally came loose.Reassembly was straightforward, and the chair now sits low enough that my legs are properly resting on the seat cushion with my feet on the floor. It's about an inch taller than my previous chair, but that's likely the result of the rollerblade wheels.The only other comment I'll make is that this is a MESH support chair, without the usual seat cushion/back. As the weather has started to cool down where I am, I'm finding that it's quite a bit more chilly to sit in than a traditional office chair. This would have been quite welcome in June, but now I'm thinking I'm gonna need something to keep my backside a little warmer as Fall and Winter pass!"", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 13, 2023', 'is_verified': True}]"

I loved my chair cause I could sit criss-cross applesauce and lean back so far that I could sleep periodically while pulling all nighters. It had no butt support (I had a pillow and blanket layered under me) and the entire thing was basically held together with packing tape, but we spent many a night together and I appreciated it beyond rational thought. The final straw tho was when I was napping and one of the legs snapped, almost landing my head on the corner of my bookshelf. Even then, I loved this chair so much that I taped a tide pod box to the broken leg and kept it for another 8 months, playing russian roulette every time I leaned back, rolling the dice if I would fall over or not. After finally acquiring a student job I decided it was time for my Tide Pod Box Chair to go to the big office max in the sky. I tell you the legacy of TPBC to emphasize how reluctant I was to get a new chair, and how picky I was at selecting it. I searched for days before finally ordering this one out of defeat.Review:It seems that every frickin chair in the world has contradicting reviews online. One review says it\'s comfy, tall, and has great support, another says that this chair kicked their dog and embezzled money from their savings account. I\'m here to assure you that this chair is a good chair. It came in 2 days with prime shipping, and took me under a half hour to assemble. My poor butt had no idea what support felt like until I sat in this desk chair.I am a lanky 6\'5"" basketball center with legs for days, and while I can\'t sit completely criss-cross applesauce like TPBC provided due to this chair\'s arms, I can twist my ridiculously long body into many comfortable positions with how wide the seat is. I don\'t think it would provide a comfortable amount of wiggle room for any of my heavier set friends out there, but my needs are met. The top of my head does go a couple inches above the back of the chair when it\'s straight up, but leaning back provides the perfect angle for me to tilt my head back and rest. The legs on this thing are sturdy. I am greatly enjoying leaning as far back as I please without the neverending threat of potential death looming over me, and I think after a good bit of use it will lean back as far as I\'d like. The lowest setting is a little high for my semi-low desk, but my criss-crossed legs still fit under comfortably.Appearance-wise this baby looks just like the picture. The cushions provide good back/spine alignment and while I was concerned that the cushy pad at the front of the seat would be annoying its not at all, it actually provides more support and prevents me from tipping forward. The twisty thing that sets how easily you can lean back does its job perfectly, as does the height adjustment.If you\'re not looking to spend a bajillion dollars on an executive chair with the most confusing reviews in the world and you don\'t have the ability to go find a chair you can test in a store cause your tuition keeps you tap dancing the poverty line, this is a really. great. chair.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States November 4, 2019', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars 6’1” 285lbs…', 'author': 'JATOAV8OR', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""Here’s how & why I chose to purchase this chair. I am 6ft 1in. and 285lbs I'm also 63yrs with back & shoulder issues. I’m not going to tolerate an uncomfortable chair. This model is among the top 5 most comfortable chairs I tried in person out of more than 50 various models and by far the best price. They ranged in price from $79 to $1600The majority of big & tall chairs I tried were over stuffed especially the headrest, that forces me into an awkward uncomfortable position that hurts my neck. Many so called (ergonomic) style chairs are exactly the opposite for me, I feel like I’m not sitting back far enough and the mesh chairs that are all the rage had frame members that hurt after only a few minutes. I think mesh is okay if you’re of average size but I couldn’t find one that I could live with.Even some of the chairs claiming to be for big & tall folks were so narrow that no space existed between me and the arms!This was one of the few chairs at any price that didn’t exhibit these design flaws and also has a sufficient weight capacity, 350lbs.I’m using this at home mostly for gaming so I can’t say how my back & butt would feel after 8 hours in it but I have sat for 4 + hours with no discomfort.I’m wide and I don’t feel cramped by the armrests and the seat is deep enough and contoured so I don’t feel like I’m slipping off the front edge. I can actually lean back and feel fully supported.When I assembled it I noticed spacers where the base mounts to the seat that slightly angles the whole chair back so you don’t have the feeling the chair is trying to eject you.There was nothing under $300 that came close to matching the size, capacity and comfort but for an additional $150 the Serta Smart Layers Air series of big & tall chairs had a couple designs that had all the attributes of the Fairbanks and also has superior padding in the seat. I would look seriously at these if I had to spend an entire workday in a chair. I went to a local showroom that had all the popular brands with various price ranges and styles, I sat in every one.As an overweight large size person my advice is first to test in person I was surprising how many poorly designed products are on the market. Secondly if you must make a choice online focus your search only on big & tall series chairs with 350lbs capacity or higher and avoid standard size chairs of 275lb or less capacity, avoid TASK style chairs and WATERFALL seat designs.TASK chairs are tilted forward and WATERFALL seats taper down in front. Both make you feel like you’re slipping off the front edge of the seat. I’ve only had this chair a month so I can’t attest to the durability but this chair checks the most boxes by far and I have no complaints especially at this price!I'm not associated with this product or any other product.

But even from the get-go I noticed a weird smell on it. Figured that it was leather so it probably had an odor that would fade as it'd been wrapped in plastic and such. So I kept using it. But the smell still hasn't gone away. In fact I'd say it's gotten worse. I'd compare its likeness to a dirty cat box.I tried contacting support twice now. Once was for something that worked itself out so its not worth mentioning. The second was about the smell. Both times the email I got back was a very copy/pasted response telling me to call a different company because apparently Serta doesn't make the chairs. So -- why are you selling a product you're unwilling to support? If they had just responded with some simple tips on ways to get rid of that smell, we'd be golden. Instead I'm sitting here frustrated because they went the easy route and bounced me to a different company. One that I'd have to call to get any support since their automated message failed to list any other options.Is the chair comfortable? Yeah it's pretty nice. It does wobble more than I like. The feeling of it moving unsecured in the bottom (the part with the rollers attached) can get annoying and I hope it doesn't wear it prematurely. The smell is pretty bad though. Every time I sit when it pushes the air out of the cushion, it stinks. Glad I don't have this in an office setting or I'm sure I'd get complaints.EDIT: March 10, 2023This is really not worth the cost. The seat CONSTANTLY wobbles like it's not screwed in all the way or the base isn't seated right. It won't stay up. A couple sits and it slowly sinks back to the lowest setting. It feels like it's cheaply made. Sure the cushioning is comfortable, but when it feels like it's not stable, and you can't keep it at a comfortable height, that's obviously a big deal.I haven't even had this a year and its definitely less quality than the cheaper one I bought YEARS ago. One that lasted me a very long time, and I was able to comfortably use up until the seams were coming out, and the seat had tilted forward from daily use for many years. I'd say at least five years?And it was a Serta as well. That's pretty sad that the quality has declined that much when a seat that costs 100.00 MORE, can't even last a year.This is pretty ridiculous."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 1, 2022', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect fit', 'author': 'Larry T', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I am a big man (tall and heavyset) I needed something which supported my stature and my weight.

Some reviewers said the chair didn’t tilt back very far or not at all, I didn’t have that problem, but it took A LOT of force to push back in the chair. After I loosened the tension knob it leaned back a bit easier, but still was uncomfortable due to how straight I sat had to sit in the chair. I did end up returning the chair not just because it was uncomfortable but because the left chair arm didn’t sit right on the back piece and the screw to hold the arm and back together wouldn’t screw in correctly.

I can easily shift it if I need to relieve pressure on my neck. This is the chair you won\'t mind sitting in ALL day. I LOVE the color combinations, which are perfect for my little craft room.

I can easily place both feet right on the ground, even being a ""short"" person. I use a foot rest anyway, so I see no issues if you are shorter using this chair.This chair is quite comfortable to sit in, with the back being very straight up. This is good and bad. You get lots of support like this, when you want to sit completely straight, but can easily lean back a bit for more comfort, when needed. You easily adjust the tension by the front knob that controls how hard you need to push back to adjust the back rest like most chairs that recline.Speaking of reclining, this chair reclines pretty far, and is very comfortable.The head rest you will need to fiddle with to make it custom fit for your head. This is the first time I have used a head rest of this type, and surprised at how comfortable it is. Putting the head rest on, while assembling the chair is the hardest part, and its quite easy to do.As some others have said, the seat mesh is a little ""scratchy"", but you get used to it.I have found that I like using a cushion on the seat for extended sitting sessions, but you may not need one. The mesh seat is quite comfortable, and sometimes I switch between using a cushion and sometimes not using one. You will have to see what works for you.One big reason I got this chair is the swing up arms. I prefer these type arms, since you can easily lift them up out of the way, where as other chairs you can\'t do this. This makes it easy to push in the chair very close to your desk, saving room.Customer Service. One word, OUTSTANDING!I have hard floors at home, and carpet at work. My work place bought me the same chair, so I bought one for home use. I emailed the company and asked about purchasing the roller type wheels for my home chair, and they offered me an additional set for the at work chair, which I didn\'t need. They were willing to ship me two sets for free! I declined the one for work, since its carpet and didn\'t need a set. Thats great customer service, which is rare now a days. Keep this in mind when shopping for a chair...there are lots out there, and this company stands behind their product.Assembly - standard for a chair like this, very easy to do, and they provide a simple video to watch. Maybe takes 10 minutes to put together, and you can do it yourself. If you have trouble lifting, you would need some assistance.Shipping - Chair comes very well packed in a sturdy box, no issues there.Quality - I did not have any issues with this chair. Very well put together.Chair options - It leans back pretty far, and with the included head rest, it is quite comfortable to lean back when you are tired for a quick rest, or even a quick, nap. (shhhh...don\'t tell the boss) You can lock the angle of the back to exactly where you want it, if you don\'t like having to push back to lean the back rest.So far I am quite happy with this chair. I have never had a full back mesh type chair, and think that this will last quite a while, even with daily use. I think you will be pleased with this purchase. While you may be able to find a similar chair for maybe a little less price, to me, the customer service you get with this purchase is really worth it. You know that they will stand behind your purchase and your being happy with your purchase of their product. I don\'t think you will be disappointed.*update*Its been 3 months since I purchased this chair and I can tell you 100% no issues with the chair at all. Its quite comfortable, and I would purchase another one, without hesitation. I can be sitting in this chair for long periods of time, with no issues. I do use a small seat cushion, just because I had it left from my previous chair, so might as well make use of it, but its not really needed for this chair. I am completely pleased with this purchase. No chair is perfect, but not being able to get into a chair and sit in it for yourself, shouldn\'t sway you from purchasing this. Its very comfortable, and even though I am 5\'4"", its perfect in size, and the head rest is great too. Easy to lean back when you are tired and take a quick nap.

After considerable time researching a replacement, I pulled the trigger on the GABRYLLY Ergonomic Mesh Office Chair for my work-from-home setup. As someone who spends long hours at the desk, I was on the hunt for a high-quality chair that would prioritize comfort, support, and functionality, while also allowing me to play guitar from the same piece of furniture. Let me tell you, this chair has exceeded my expectations on all fronts!First and foremost, the ergonomic design of this chair is exceptional. The high back provides excellent support for my entire spine, promoting proper posture and alleviating strain. I'm not a small person, so having a chair that fits my tall frame and weight was clearly of paramount concern. This chair holds up and hasn't shown any signs of stretching or failure. The breathable mesh material keeps me cool and comfortable throughout the day, even during extended periods of sitting. You can actually feel the breeze from underneath, which is a change from my old cloth-bottom chair that would get pretty warm in the summer months.The chair's adjustability options are impressive. The height can be easily adjusted, as can the pitch of the backrest. The armrests are also adjustable, which allows me to flip them back and out of the way for when I play my guitars. The reclining function is very nice, but I opt to keep mine set more upright all the time. As for the headrest, it is kind of the only piece of the chair that I don't find much use for. Unless you lean your whole body back into the chair and lay your head back, the headrest doesn't even come into play.Durability is a standout feature of this chair. The sturdy construction and high-quality materials make it feel solid and long-lasting, but without sacrificing comfort. I initially had the regular casters in the chair, but saw that others were able to contact the company and get a set of rollerblade wheels as a free upgrade. I did that as I am working on a tile floor. And while the regular casters were workable, the roller wheels are much more suited to the solid, but bumpy flooring my workspace is located in.Assembly was a breeze, thanks to the clear instructions and the included tools. Within minutes, I had the chair ready for use. Everything was very straightforward.In terms of customer service, GABRYLLY has been exceptional. They promptly addressed my inquiries and provided support. When requesting the wheel upgrade, they reached back out to me very quickly and answered all of my questions. The wheels were here to me in a matter of days. Very responsive support.I wholeheartedly recommend this chair to anyone in need of an upgrade. It's an affordable chair with the quality of a much higher price tag."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States June 28, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Awesome chair and excellent Customer Service', 'author': 'JoeyO', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Update 7-26-23Jennie and the after sales support from this company is bar none, one of the very best I\'ve ever come across since I\'ve been an Amazon Prime Member for over 15 years.Recently, the headrest broke by accident, so I emailed the company and they gladly accommodated my request for a replacement. Unfortunately, because of a new design in the chair itself, the headrest wouldn\'t work, as the backrest is different now.. I emailed Jennie and they very quickly are sending me a new backrest to make it all whole again.I couldn\'t be happier with the chair. It\'s made with great pride and the support team are always ready to make sure the customers are happy.

I checked out so many chairs on Amazon, local stores and sites like Staples, Office Depot, and others. I even looked on Amazon for Gaming Chairs as they seemed like they would be comfortable. To my dismay didn\'t find one to my liking.Being an Amazon Prime Member for 14 years now, I continued my search on Amazon. That\'s when I stumbled upon this GABRYLLY Ergonomic Mesh Office Chair. I read all the reviews and at first was hesitant to purchase it online as was asking myself - \'Oh no! What if I don\'t like it, how will go about returning such a bulky chair?\'I took a leap of faith and went ahead and ordered it online, and was far less expensive than those I saw in local furniture stores and other websites. It arrived in two days as promised, and I was very excited to assemble it, and the first thing that I came to mind was: ""Oh boy, I wonder how long this was going to take me to put it together!""To my surprise and amazement, it literally took me more time to unbox and take out all of meticulous wrapping which was done to perfection; and assembling the chair was a breeze, just following along the detailed instructions that came with it. I had it done and rolling to my study in about 15 to 20 minutes tops.Upon sitting on the chair for the first time, I knew there and then that I made the right decision in purchasing this office chair. It\'s super comfortable and the ergonomic design was really to my liking. The headrest was so nice and can easily be adjusted in so many ways. I also like that the armrests can be lifted up and placed out of the way, so that you can roll the chair closer to the table and be in a more comfortable position when typing on the on my various computers :-)The adjustments you can do on the chair was also well though of and such a breeze. For example, I adjusted the tension of how easy it would be to lean back and rock back and forth.Folks, look no further!! This chair fits me to a T!! I am 6""2\' about 155 lbs and the GABRYLLY Ergonomic Mesh Office Chair is super comfortable and the manufacturer went to great length to build this quality chair and paid so much to details, such as the legs where you can place your feet is also testament of how much went into its design. Rotating and rolling back the chair are also very quiet and smooth.In conclusion, as you can see in the photos I\'ve posted, my study/computer room, is my \'Man Cave\' as my wife would call it and this chair was a perfect addition, and couldn\'t be happier.Congrats to those behind the scenes who paid such close attention to details, and made this chair very easy to assemble and extremely comfortable to use.Hope you find this review useful and thanks to all those who have posted their own reviews which helped me in my search for the perfect chair.Thanks and God Bless to all.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 10, 2022', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent Value', 'author': 'AW', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'I recently got around to assembling my chair and it was incredibly simple -- everything necessary comes with the chair, as promised. The holes, hardware and heavy plastics were all correctly drilled / machined and went together without any issues. I didn\'t even need to oil the screws, like I have to with most home assembly furniture I order.As a Hawaii resident, I\'m used to boxes from the mainland arriving torn open and battered like they owed someone money. My chair box was, indeed, quite battered and showed signs of having been kicked or shoved by several different peoples footwear before arriving and there were gouges in the corners where I assume it had been roughly shoved into and out of vehicles.The box is made of \'double layer\' and incredibly stiff cardboard, enough so that the interior layer was not damaged at all. The box is currently being requisitioned by my wife to provide shelter to local strays when the weather inevitably turns, as it always does. The product was in perfect condition. Pristine.The chair, once assembled, sits high enough my daughter (5\'6) can barely touch the floor with her toes at it\'s highest setting. The arm rests are satisfactory, but not especially comfortable, so I\'ll likely leave them folded up going forward, or look for a cushioned sleeve for them.The mesh material is coarse and isn\'t especially comfortable to lean back on without a shirt, which is a serious issue for people in tropical climates. In board shorts or pants the seat is comfortable and springy, but once again, if you\'re keen to wear short shorts or want to lounge around in your underwear in the evenings (or during mercilessly hot tropical afternoons), it\'s going to get very uncomfortable, very quickly. I\'d imagine it will be intolerable for ladies in similar states of undress.The head rest is a nice idea, but the arch of the chair makes using it a bit problematic without some very fine tuning. If you\'re tall enough (I\'m 6\'1 and it works, barely), you can use a kind of ""V"" setup (you\'ll understand when you look at it) to get it far enough out you can make use of it.If you\'re shorter, say... 5\'7 or under? You\'re probably not going to need to bother connecting it to the chair at all, due to the arch of the backrest and the design of the headrest.That said, it\'s an excellent value, especially on sale. The instructions are in a proper booklet, well-written and easy to follow. The warranty is in it\'s own stiff envelope. I was able to re-package the spare hardware and key-tools in the package in came in, to store in my cabinet. The construction is solid (remember to re-tighten after two weeks of use!) and feels very much comparable to the $1,400 chairs we have at the office, save for the mesh not being nearly as luxurious (or luxurious at all, being coarse plastic).I\'d recommend it for anyone looking for a solid office or gaming chair, but not if you\'re planning to spend a lot of time lounging around in it to watch videos or similar. If you\'re in a tropical climate, be aware that it will not accommodate your being in any state but properly dressed. If you\'re like me and spend most of your time at home wearing board shorts and nothing else, you\'re gonna wanna find a nice cover to throw over the back seat.I\'ve got one of my wife\'s airy sarongs thrown over the back to take advantage of the trade winds, while avoiding the scratchy mesh.I\'m quite happy with my purchase.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 3, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Superior product and superior customer service', 'author': 'Mark mayo', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I was expecting a lot when I ordered this chair. I was not disappointed!First, about the chair assembly:The assembly was quick and easy. Even for one with a very bad back, although I did have to be on the floor. I would have been on the floor no matter what chair I put together. I have assembled several office chairs over time. This one was, by far, the most enjoyable. The instructions were clear, and the illustrations were actually helpful. I have not been so fortunate with other chairs.Second, the chair itself:It is well made. Having been burned by other manufacturers, I inspected this as I was unpacking. I did not see any flaws. The parts are solid and well made. Some other chairs I have owned had to take some adjustments to be comfortable. This one was comfortable right out of the box. I weigh 220 (though I am planning on losing some weight), and it supported me without groaning. The headrest is incredibly adjustable about. I was able to find just the right position in no time. With most of the other chairs I have owned, the headrests were more ornamental than functional. One of the main reasons I bought this chair was for arms that swing up. That makes it extremely function for my guitar playing. I don’t have to purchase an extra chair: this one handles my office needs and my studio needs as well.Third is the customer service:I was skeptical of the other reviews that extolled the service. Trust the reviews. This customer service was responsive. Jennie was concise and helpful. It was a pleasure to work with her. Again, I have not had good experiences with other companies. I contacted them to inquire about the price of the roller blade wheels. Their reply was that the would send a set at no cost. As for the lumbar pillow that some reviews had mentioned, they were out of stock.If you can’t tell by now, I am an extremely satisfied customer.I would recommend this chair to anyone.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 23, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars My favorite office chair!!!', 'author': 'Casey Payton', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I originally bought one of these around 2021 and it was incredible!

The arm rests adjust to slide up and down and you can fold them up if you have a slightly shorter desk. The mechanisms for reclining and rocking and locking are so sturdy, I never feel unsafe when I lean back. And above all else, they have amazing customer service!! I went to active my warranty with them and they activated it AND sent me the upgraded wheels that work better on wood flooring! They’re very kind and they have a great product.

I’m a big guy, 260lbs, 6’3”, and this chair is quite comfortable and has held up very well. I didn’t want to review this chair too early as I wanted to have some time with it. To my surprise, this chair seems to punch up above its price range quite a bit. There’s a lot of value here when thinking of durability and comfort.I believe I’ve owned it for almost a year now and it’s pretty much exactly like it was when I first bought it. The netting on the seat has sagged slightly, but it isn’t noticeable. I’m a guitar player and the fold back arms are SO convenient! The wheels still work like new, gas piston still goes up and down, and the recline adjuster works fine.The only issues I have with this chair are the recline adjustment isn’t that great. It seems like after some wear I can’t get the back to adjust completely forward anymore. The headrest is well made but I wish it angled forward a lot more so it would actually be useable without having to sit all the way back. These aren’t deal breakers at all though, just small nit picks.Overall, I’ve been very pleased. I feel this chair is a great value. I use it ever single day for long hours, work and play, and it’s always comfortable. I never get tired of sitting in this chair, and for a large man that’s saying a lot. The fact that this chair can hold up to my weight and still look great and be comfortable after almost a year is a great sign for its overall longevity. It really does look just like it did when I bought it besides the slight sag in the netting.Highly recommended! This chair will last!

This chair has addressed both readily; in particular, the front of the seat slopes off instead of coming to a hard lip so it doesn\'t dig into my legs when sitting. The ergonomics are excellent as the chair has various ways to customize the sit; the seat back is adjustable, letting you tilt it to where you like and lock it in place there (I don\'t like to sit bolt-upright, so I leaned it back one level). The headrest is also adjustable in two directions, so you can put that right where you like it as well, and even the arms can be adjusted to put them where you like when they\'re swiveled down.The mesh is supportive but has give to it. It\'s no memory foam, but that\'s not what I was looking for. It breathes well and doesn\'t stick in humid environments. It\'s rubberized and lightly rough to run your fingers over, but that roughness keeps you from slipping around; unless you plan to use it naked, it\'s fine. If you really don\'t like the feel of it on your butt, however, they\'ll send you a cushion—more on that in a sec. I also got the optional blade-style wheels (again more in a sec), which I ended up not using for now, because they don\'t play well with padded carpets, but which I think are perfect for shallow carpets, hard floors, or carpet protectors.The only issue I\'ve had with this chair is—and bear with me here—it absorbs farts like some sort of ass osmosis. It started to stink of butt real quick, and requires periodic maintenance; simple soap and water via rag works fine. I don\'t know what it is, but be aware that if you are a flatulent folk, you may need to address this. I brought this to their attention and they offered me a seat cushion, which brings me to the ""in a sec"":Probably the best thing about this chair is the customer service. When assembling the chair, I noticed in the instructions that they offer ""blade"" style wheels as an option (think rollerblades). Having never used such a thing on a chair, I decided to contact the provided email. Turns out I didn\'t have to—they ended up reaching out to me on their own anyway to ask how the chair was. When I inquired about the wheels to find out how much they\'d cost, the answer was nothing; they shipped the wheels to me for free, shipping and all. When I mentioned the issue with the mesh smell, they offered me a seat cushion as well, although I didn\'t take that offer because I like the feel of the seat as is and I can address the smell easily enough. From other reviews I\'ve seen they offer other accessories, and I believe them.You, savvy shopper who reads reviews, may be asking why they don\'t just include all of these accessories from the get-go. I haven\'t asked, but the chair is worth the price as-is, and not everyone will want or need every accessory, so including them with every chair would not only be unnecessary (and probably raise the price), but wasteful as well. Since they reach out to customers to offer these accessories, and include contact info to ask yourself in the instructions, I think this method is a good call.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States April 29, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great chair and great customer service!', 'author': 'Michael DeMaria', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I bought this chair because my previous ones were hurting my back. I decided to splurge and spend the money on this. It had other great reviews and customer support so I figured why not. The box came with everything you need and the assembly instructions were easy to understand. I reached out to the customer support to inquire on getting the back support and additional cushion that was referenced in other reviews. Customer service got back to me and are shipping both. We'll see how the cushion seat is. A lot of others have said it's superior to the mesh. Personally, if this product didn't have great customer support willing to send that out, this chair would be a 3.5 star, maybe a 4. The mesh seat is firm, but nice when you first sit in it. But after awhile, it starts to hurt your butt. So again, if just the mesh seat, not a 5 start product. The willingness from the seller to work with you on that though brings me to the 5 star review. The reclining capability is nice too. It's a little stiff at first but you get used to it. It goes back pretty far too which is nice. The head rest is adjustable which I think is a great feature. If you don't like it, it's easy to remove too. The arm rests adjust which I use constantly. Didn't know that was on this chair but it's definitely a welcome addition. I don't know how long the mesh seat back will last, hopefully a long time. It seems good quality and allows a lot of air flow. I'm a fan. In summation, the chair is a pretty solid product.

The packaging was adequate, consisting mostly of sheets of cardboard and components wrapped in thin bubble-wrap. Assembly instructions were clear, and I'm pretty handy with tools so not too difficult to put together. Keep in mind you will have some effort to get all the parts unwrapped, laid out, and assembled. I appreciate the T-handle Allen wrenches, vs the normal kit tools, and inclusion of extra screws in the package.After assembly, I found that the chair was a little difficult to roll on my floors, and sits a little too high for my legs. The assembly instructions said to contact the seller for support, and after letting them know my issues, they mailed me a set of rollerblade casters, and a shorter gas piston for the seat lift. They'd also mentioned that additional lumbar support is available and they mailed me a strap-on pillow for my back. It has a couple elastic bands to hold it on the chair.Installation of the casters was straightforward and I was able to swap them out by hand. The gas cylinder, on the other hand, gave me fits! The video clip included in the support email showed someone gently hitting the base with a mallet. I got my rubber mallet and after tipping the chair on its side, banged on the base for a while with no success. I eventually had to turn it upside down over a couple bins, then use some squeeze clamps and a wooden block to push against the bottom of the gas cylinder and was able to get that off. Separating the top of the gas cylinder piston from the bottom of the chair mechanism was a trial in patience. I hit the bottom of the chair with my mallet, I hit the piston on the sides to try to loosen it. I removed the seat mechanism from the seat, and hit that with the mallet. I put ice-packs around the junction, then hit it. I put the ice packs back, got everything cold, then took my heat gun to try to warm the seat steel and then hit it. I clamped the piston in my wood vise and tried to pry the bottom off with a crowbar (and blocks of wood to keep it from scratching). I tried a pipe wrench to twist the piston. Finally, I opened my vise jaws up, rested the seat mechanism across it and my bench, then took a hardwood stick, put it on the shoulder of the gas cylinder, and hit the top of the stick with a hammer. A few whacks on either side and it finally came loose.Reassembly was straightforward, and the chair now sits low enough that my legs are properly resting on the seat cushion with my feet on the floor. It's about an inch taller than my previous chair, but that's likely the result of the rollerblade wheels.The only other comment I'll make is that this is a MESH support chair, without the usual seat cushion/back. As the weather has started to cool down where I am, I'm finding that it's quite a bit more chilly to sit in than a traditional office chair. This would have been quite welcome in June, but now I'm thinking I'm gonna need something to keep my backside a little warmer as Fall and Winter pass!"", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 13, 2023', 'is_verified': True}]"

That being said, when I got it, shipping box and contents inside were all nicely packaged and protected inside and individually wrapped or boxed. The quality of the chair does seem very nice for the price you are paying. I did not get this chair necessarily as a gaming chair as the title of the product states it as. I just liked the look of it and the features it includes. I also wanted a tall back chair for head and neck support. I am 6’3” tall and my last office chair was only a mid level back and old and falling apart. The installation of the chair was actually fairly easy in my opinion. The included paper instructions provided more than enough detail and instruction to get me through it. I did create a customer how to/installation and setup video which should be showing up any day now once approved. Made understanding how to install it a much more fun way to watch it being built from ground up. I’ve had the chair now and have used it for a few days now. The very first full day I had it (I installed it the night before after work), I actually came home super tired and sat down in it. I give the comfortable rating a 7/10. It was comfortable enough especially when reclining the chair back, I actually fell fast asleep it in. Wasn’t a LazyBoy comfort sleeping chair but it was good enough especially for an office chair. I rate it a 7 for a reason though, something I am honestly very disappointed in and debating on rather I can keep it or not. If one tiny issue was fixed, I would likely give this chair and comfort a 9 or 10 rating. My problem is this: the seat itself, is not wide enough. I am of a fairly average build. However with the raised angled ends on the seat itself where it feels like sturdy metal support bars inside, it keeps my hips and thighs so tight together with no room for much of a relaxed open leg seating position. It almost gives a slight bruising feeling on the side of my upper thighs and hips after prolonged time in it and possibly even pushing on veins and arteries in my legs just enough to slightly cut off blood circulation which in turn gives me a slight dead leg with tingle sensation. I have to keep adjusting my legs and move them from keeping this from happening. Also, I feel the seat could had used some sort of opening or circulation to circulate air. It gets to be a pretty warm seat after awhile. If the seat itself was maybe 6 inches wider or else didn’t have the lifted angled sides on the ends of the seat, I’d say this chair is perfect. Back and head and neck support are all great in my opinion. My butt is by no means a wide big butt (haha) so for my wife with wider hips, naturally as a woman, she was uncomfortable in it instantly and didn’t like it whatsoever. If they ever modify this seat I would be willing to update the review. For now, as I said, I would take caution on seeing how the seat feels for you. I would almost pull the seat out and maybe just install the armrests and sit on it on the ground before putting it all together to see what may be an issue for you as well. I will upload a photo of the seat with me in it to show an example once Amazon turns photo uploads for reviews back on, apparently they have turned the option off temporarily citing the COVID as some sort of reason.Update: I added photos as promised now that it gave me the ability to add them. The photos are to show the narrow seat conditions as I say in the chair and my outer thighs and hips and tight up against the elevated sides of the seat.I did purchase another item here on Amazon, a high rated seat cushion pillow which elevated me up a bit off the seat and has tremendously increased the comfort now where my thighs are not being squashed together. Grant it I shouldn’t have to buy something else to make this seat work better and more comfortable but I really didn’t want to have to deal with the time and pain in disassembling the chair and trying to send it back. I made it work. The seat cushion set me back another $30 but it’s worth it and I can technically take it with me elsewhere if I want to use it and it does really major sitting in this office chair a lot more comfortable and cooler temperature as well.

Some of the surfaces are also a little dusty, but I used a simple multi-purpose cleaner spray and it came right off.Chair tilts a little backwards, but when you sit on it, it feels straight so I guess that's just how it's supposed to be. The back rest has a tilt/recline feature, which you activate with a lever on the right side almost exactly like a car seat does.The included lumbar and neck pillows are filled with some cheap cushion material and covered also in PU leather. The higher end chairs will give you velour covered memory foam. You can also buy those for $30-50 if you really want to as well.I would say if you like this style of chair, the next real upgrades are real grain leather and Napa leather options. That will set you back $500+ and $700+ and you can really only get them from Noble Chairs or Secretlab. I plan to do this for the Napa at some point, albeit they are out of stock, and chances are the price will get closer to $1k. I am not fully sure if those will last longer either, you might just be better off buying this chair every few years instead.As I wrote above, PU chairs are all pretty much the same. The material really doesn't change. They all seemingly use a nylon base, PU leather, steel frame and foam for the cushions. This chair says it uses a shaping sponge, while the others say they use cold cured foam. The cold cured foam maybe is a step above, and the velour with memory foam pillows probably are too, but I'm not sure that it's worth the $300+ most of the gaming racing chairs charge. I seriously think once you start going above this price point at $100-120 or so, the next upgrade has got to be in the upholstery, and nothing else really will matter as much.Overall I'd give this chair a solid 3 or 4, but for the right person it's a 5. That's the problem with the rating system, I don't know exactly what you personally are looking for. An inexpensive chair that will last a couple of years or more and is in this style, it's a 5 easily. If you're looking for really high quality, and it's just a step for you, maybe it's a 3 or 4. But at this price point I can't justify anything below 5 stars, so I give it a 5, and I urge people that want to try this style out to seriously consider grabbing this one first, if they can't test out a higher priced chair for awhile and don't feel comfortable just dropping a higher price amount without testing something.Edit 1 Week: Smell was really terrible for the first 2-3 days, but then faded and is fine/gone now. Might not be a bad idea to let this air out a few days somewhere.The arms got wobbly and I had to re-tighten the bolts. I had to do this two times. Not sure if this will be a continuing issue or not.I'm still undecided whether I will stick with this or go for a better leather version. I really don't want to get another PU version, so for that I'll probably stick with this. But if I see a good deal on the real leather and napa leather options I'm leaning towards getting that, and giving this one to someone else as a gift."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States April 7, 2018', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '3.0 out of 5 stars We, as a society, need to rethink chairs like this', 'author': 'Keegs', 'rating': 3, 'content': ""Look, whoever started the trend of leather gaming chairs needs a stern talking-to.This might apply to all gaming chairs (I play games but wouldn't consider myself a serious gamer si IDK), but there are some serious problems with a chair like this:1. SupportLook, I've sat in a million offices with $1,000 chairs designed by the world's leading back-support engineers and even those hurt your back after a while. Sitting fully upright like Queen Elizabeth for 8 straight hours will do that. That being said, I haven't had any issues with this chair in that regard. Except for the pillow. The freaking pillow.This chair comes with this weird strap-on leather pillow that goes... somewhere?! It can go behind your back, but then your spine is forced to make an inverted C-shape that no human being can possibly enjoy. You can also strap it around the top like the headrest of a cheap dental seat but it literally does nothing for comfort or your neck.2. FartingOkay, okay, HEAR ME OUT ON THIS. This chair features a flat leather seat. Think that through. There's no mesh. No cloth. Your ass is literally suction-cupped to this leather panel. Where do you think that fart is going the second you feel the urge? If you're a gamer and are spending multiple hours in front of a screen, there's a big chance, you're gonna have to fart at some point. Do you peel your sweaty butt from the synthetic leather surface to let one rip? Or do you take your chances of a full-on backfire while seated?And that's only the start of it.This seat is made of a material that, smell-wise, remembers EVERYTHING. I kid you not, I clean this seat every day because of how bad it can smell. If my cat jumps up on it, it smells like kitty litter (bad girl!). If I fart on it, it smells like farts. If I drop a cheeto between my legs IT SMELLS LIKE CHEETOS. And these smells linger indefinitely. If you don't regularly clean this chair, it will start to smell like everything you've ever sat on.3. HeatIf you're a human being and sweat when you're hot, ohhh boy, are you in for a treat. The adhesive properties of this faux-leather seat are honestly impressive. I haven't done this but I 100% believe if you sat on this chair naked for 20 seconds, you could pick it up with you and walk away with it stuck to your back.In the winter it was fine, honestly. But once summer hit and I stared wearing shorts again and, Gods forbid, I didn't wear a shirt?! Game. Over. I was sitting upright like Queen Elizabeth all on my own in a desperate attempt to keep my back away from my own chair. And, without a comfortable black, you're sitting on a freaking stool. So be ready to crank the AC lest you become part of the chair like old Boostrap Bill stuck on the side of The Flying DutchmanIN CONCLUSION: It's fine. Do I miss my old chair that completely broke? Yeah. Does this one look good? Yeah! Does it support my back and keep me 100% comfortable? NOPE. Should we, as a society, rethink chairs like this? Yes, I think so."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States June 24, 2020', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Experience Comfort and Style with the Homall Gaming Chair', 'author': 'Phil Salvo', 'rating': 4, 'content': ""I recently purchased the Homall Gaming Chair, and I must say that it has exceeded my expectations in terms of comfort, style, and functionality.

After reading reviews I decided on this one. My daughter is a large gal and I needed something that was a bit sturdier. This chair was advertised as being ""heavy duty"" and accommodating up to 400 lbs. I highly doubt someone 400 lbs. could use this chair and it far too narrow for a heavier person. I have had the chair for about a month and here are some of my thoughts:Pros: Stylish good looks: The leather is attractive and it looks like a much more expensive chair. Easy Assembly: It took me only a short time to assemble it and the instructions were easy to follow. Comfort: The seat and back are reasonably comfortable.Cons: The wheels are awful. They lock up and I end up just scooting the chair across the floor mat. It would be impossible to maneuver the chair on even the lowest pile carpeting. It does not recline to 110° in rocking mode as advertised. It is very tightly sprung and takes a lot of effort to tilt back. This may loosen up with time.In all fairness, I have not yet contacted the company regarding the wheels, but do plan to do so. It is too much of a pain to return the chair after having assembled it, so I plan to keep it, but if I had tried it in a store I would never have purchased it.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 6, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '2.0 out of 5 stars not what expected, and slight damage.... cushion torn !!', 'author': 'mike', 'rating': 2, 'content': ""first off, fast FED GROUND delivery... also height of seat to 21 3/4 is excellent for longer leg users, two great observations in the purchase. fed ex ground delivered a dusty box and other items to farm on dusty hot road... was expected .... not a normal day... smaller box, chair is in there...opened box in center of room and ready for assembly... i have put chairs together before for the various computer tables.. assembled with viewing picture instructions... inventory was on par with one extra screw lag for short and long grommets...Allen wrench is big L shaped and quite handy .. assembled in 15 minutes..wheels went on the best ... must be firm with seat screws as one seamed stripped and then gripped... one chair rest is lose , but with some lock tight, will grip... for a rated Big and tall chair, seat height is there, actuator is easily controlled, arm rest are nicely padded, but short... 34 inch arms here, so rests need to be 3 to 4 inches longer..seat is hard and with 24 hrs seating, already depressing.... so you will lose your leg height to floor from seat...i am 220 clothes on ..chair rated to 400 pounds.... it can make chair less stable, so no rough housing in chair .... for a foam, the seat is quite hard.... not an 8 hr chair, although i thought was rated for longer seating... this is a smaller chair for a Big and Tall executive, not really a Big Tall man's chair... i am over 6 ' 2 and shoulders or at top of back.. high back seems 46 inches though..no real head rest.. shoulder rest there though, but don't snap your neck back stretching.... repeating good things... great Allen wrench, SOFT ARM RESTS, excellent HARD BASE with WHEELS, and seat height will equal 21 inches give or take seat depression, incredible fast fed ex ground shipping......now the BAD, not so comfortable, tiny tall executive chair, screws can easily strip so be positive on the attaching to grommet and aligning up, and the worse for last, THERE WAS A TEAR IN THE BACK CUSHION ON TOP EDGE OF CHAIR.. probably happened in packing or on assembly line... very thin material... after assembly, so tough to return in boxing up again.... i am thinking lock tight on my screw and gorilla tape on my tear.. i would return if easy to box up !!! it was only a 130 purchase with the coupon discount.. be well , be safe...

I had an expensive gaming chair for a handful of years and I never really liked it. They are “supposed” to be more comfortable as they’re made to be occupied for long durations, but I feel like I will disagree with anyone who argues that’s truthful. I work from home and work 10 ish hour days on average and basically live in my chair. I also have a terrible back and neck and struggle to be comfortable in literally any seat. I’ve only had this one for a few days but man is it a world of difference from my last.The seat padding is so welcoming from what I lacked in my last chair. The seat is also pretty wide which I appreciate because I tend to sit cross legged or perched like a bird sometimes, and small seats or fixed armrests just don’t accommodate (hence I love that the armrests lift up on this chair). It’s high back but not super high, which I like. I’m 5’4, 135lbs for reference. Someone taller would likely not have the same head/neck support that I do, but should still be quite comfy in it. My husband is 6’ and finds it very comfortable as well.The wheels are a fantastic feature because they roll effortlessly. I suspect even with carpeted floors they would do well. Only downside is I’ve stood up to adjust my clothes and go to sit back down only to find my chair has made its way across my room and I almost ate it on the floor instead. Clearly that’s a me thing though and I just have to be conscientious about it.Overall it was easy to put together, feels well made and durable, and most of all it’s honestly comfortable.

The available adjustments work well, but more adjustments are needed like lumbar. The cushioning is decent, but would not want to sit in this chair for more than an hour at a time without a break. While the flip up armrests can come in handy for storage, it does weaken the arms so that you get some bend when you use the arms to get out of the chair.The not so good: You can't adjust the tilt angle of the seat bottom which means the angle between the seat bottom and seat back is fixed. For me, the angle is too upright. If I could adjust the seat bottom tilt, I could add angle to make it far more comfortable. The other big issue is the front of the seat bottom is pretty flat unlike many executive chairs that have a front seat bottom that slopes downward. Being flat, it puts a lot of pressure underneath your thighs and almost cuts off your circulation. After about an hour of sitting, I have to get up for a while cuz I start to hurt. If it were easier to return, I probably would.Additional: There were many very positive reviews for this chair when I purchased it, and a big reason why I did.

In any case, I felt this chair was certainly worthy of a positive write-up.As with many, my workplace went into lockdown when Covid hit the US. Long story short, I went from an in-office every day employee to a full remote one. While I've had office chairs in the past for my personal use, I decided that if I'm going to be home most of the time, I should maybe look for something better after it became clear the lockdown was going to last longer than was anticipated.I purchased a gaming chair but I ended up not liking it. It was too thin. I like changing positions a lot, which includes tucking my left leg under me or sitting cross-legged at times. Something I had a hard time doing in the gaming chair. Plus only the back reclined, not the whole seat. Given this, I ordered a new standard office chair like I've had in the past and used it until now. I though I knew what a good chair felt like to sit in. I was wrong.The old chair has been showing it's age since I bought it a couple yrs ago and became uncomfortable to sit in all day. Given this, I was looking for a replacement when I came across this one. Looked like a better chair than I normally got and decided to go for it.It's not hard to put together. Especially if you have real tools on-hand to use than the cheap ones packages with the bolts that came with this chair. It also helps if you've put a few chairs together yourself in the past. The only hard part was trying to put the back on. I couldn't hold the chair steady while screwing in the back brace bolts and needed my wife to hold it for me. Outside that,only takes normal work to put it together. Maybe 20 minutes from start to finish.Now that I had for a few days, I can't state how much of an improvement this chair is over the one's I've had in the past. It glides so smoothly over the floor as it uses in-line skate wheels rather than the caster wheels common on the chairs I've had in the past.

I had my doubts about it at first, but have raised my initial 3 star rating to a 5 star! Read my last update below for more info, but I am still using the chair to get around the house some of the time although I am beginning to walk a few steps here and there again since my severe injury back in November. I really thought that the wheels were going to give out since they aren\'t designed for how I\'ve been using the chair, but they are still fine! It\'s still very comfortable, and I\'ve had no problems with it.If you spend a lot of time in the chair, I\'d recommend after a few months going back and tightening the screws that hold the arms to the base and the back. I did that last month and they had loosened a bit from when I first put it together. I\'m keeping the allen wrench that came with the chair in my office close at hand so I can keep checking their tightness every couple of months or so. VERY happy with this, so well worth the money!UPDATE: 1/31/18 I\'ve now had this chair for nearly 5 months. I decided to keep it since I could not find one I liked better, and needed a chair ASAP. I\'m significantly more impressed with it now than I was when I first received it! My initial review was three stars, I\'ve now increased that to four stars.Over two months ago, I tore a ligament in my foot. Major issues with getting around! I ended up grabbing my office chair here, and using it to sit in, using my good foot to push myself around the house. I\'ve been doing this for two months, and it has been so extraordinarily helpful! I am a bit concerned that the wheels might be starting to give out, but then again the amount of wear and tear I\'ve put on them in the past two months is significantly more than one would normally rolling office chair around.I have adapted to the shape of the chair, and find it so much more comfortable now than I did at first. I love how soft the back is, I\'ve adjusted to the seat being harder and tilted a bit. The padding on the arms is an extra bonus. I would bring this up to five stars if I weren\'t so concerned still about how the arms attached to the seat and the back. Still concerned about longevity.-------------------------------------I received this chair yesterday (9/7/17). It was not nearly as easy to put together as the listing makes it seem, it would be much easier with two people. Finally have it together and using it.First off, most of the parts are plastic. Very poor quality. Not sure if I will keep this or send it back at this point. I purchased this because my very old previous desk chair fell apart recently, resulting in a frightening neck injury. The arms are held onto the seat by 2 screws each, and the back is only held onto the arms by another 2 screws on each side. The back does not directly attach to the seat at all. I\'m feeling very concerned about it breaking like my old one did (although that one had been used for several years first!).I\'m also very disappointed that the seat doesn\'t go any lower. I\'m a 5\'3"" woman with short legs. I can\'t come close to touching the floor with my feet, even with this on the lowest setting. Seems ridiculous to me; I know many women who are much shorter than I am! Dangling my feet in the air like a child is not conducive to working at my desk or feeling remotely comfortable.There is also a lack of comfort in this chair. With padded upholstery, I expected to have a bit of a cushy feel in the seat, and it is quite hard. The fabric itself is soft, but you definitely don\'t sink down into the seat at all. I also greatly dislike how the front of the seat slopes downward, which is really uncomfortable in any seated position. Makes me feel like I\'m going to slide off of the chair, and if it were slick like leather instead of microfiber, I probably would! The seat is also not as large as I expected it to be based on the measurements given; plenty large enough for sitting regularly with feet on the floor (which I can\'t do with this), but I\'d wanted to be able to sit in it cross legged and it\'s definitely not wide enough for that.One more note: you cannot tilt back at all in this chair as most office chairs do. You can only sit up straight and swivel.About the only two positive things I can think of about this chair are that the fabric is super soft, I love that the arms are padded - the arms on my old chair were wood over metal and were very hard and uncomfortable.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 8, 2017', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars At Last, THE perfect exec Office Chair!

This provides abundant support, and is comfortable, sturdy, and wheels glide effortlessly where you want the chair to roll. It is a beautiful color, and makes any office area Pop.No assembly, no issues, the arms are upholstered, too, and must say, I feel so good in this cozy chair. BTW I like reviews when the purchaser includes details about their height, weight, size for furniture pieces as there is, in my opinion, no OSFA (one size fits all) in executive office chairs. I spend hours a day in mine so I need to be completely comfortable all day long, day in, day out. This Serta? I believe the Serta Fairies took my measurements in my sleep, and custom designed this wonderful piece especially for me. I am a tall female, fit, 5\'9"", legs for days, with long arms and the armrests are essential for me.I am in my 40\'s but an accident left me with severe, debilitating neck, lower back & thoracic injuries. I could not find an office chair that looked this good, that ""fit"" me. Then there is the comfort factor. This is THE best investment and I had a $900 chair that was inferior to this gem. I got rid of that one and this is perfect. This is really soothing my neck surgery residuals. For anyone with spinal problems, health issues, this may be helpful to you. My friend stayed here two weeks, said it helped calm her carpal tunnel syndrome nerve pain. She recovered from her left hand carpal tunnel surgery, and will be having her right hand surgery soon.The price is really low for the features, support, design, quality and am delighted after a long, frustrating year of trying out exec chairs, I found my perfect fit.

It's still held together after a year, so no complaints there. I wasn't expecting any kind of support on the cushion, so comfort is pretty okay too. I haven't had any pain issues on my back or otherwise since using it! I think my favorite feature of this chair are the soft armrests. They are very nice, and sit at just the right level, even if they aren't adjustable :>Okay now for the cons :'DAfter maybe three or so months, the chair started squeaking quite a bit. So just be aware that if you have a roomie or s/o who hates squeaky sounds, then maybe go with a different chair (luckily my s/o is totally fine with the noise haha). Its just the sort of thing that happens with cheaper chairs, which is alright if you're on that budget.Secondly, although the microfiber covering feels really nice you need to beware if you live in an area with dry air (like Southern California, for example). I didn't realize it at first, but if you live in a dry climate and have a carpet floor this chair becomes.... scary. Why? Because if you touch any metal surface when you stand to get up out of your chair, you will get a BIG electric shock. I'm 100% serious on this--and it really startled me when it started happening! Sometimes the shocks would get so big, I could actually see light coming from my fingertip. It can be a little painful if you don't remember to discharge the electricity somehow (i.e. I touch the wall to get rid of the static buildup after standing up). I wear socks all the time, so this also factors into the static buildup. I have metal parts in my desk that I use this chair with, so unfortunately shocks are frequent for me. Just something I gotta live with until I get a new chair or a cover I guess!That being said, I'm still fine with purchasing this chair.

Cohen', 'rating': 3, 'content': 'Needed a sturdier chair for my home office, and I personally like the feel of microfiber vs. leather (or fake leather). The chair has very stiff cushioning (which I like for prolonged periods of sitting) and the arm rests are at a reasonable height and width for me (I\'m 6\', 220lbs). The chair offers a decently ergonomic experience albeit it\'s a touch on the tall side even when fully lowered. My 5\'4"" wife said it would be uncomfortable for her to sit in for very long since her legs dangle a bit. Not too much of a problem for me, but the real issue with this chair is that it leans back only a fraction of what it should.The reason for this is two metal tabs that make contact with the back side of the hinge mechanism. There\'s only about a 1/4"" gap in there which doesn\'t allow for very much tilt at all, making the chair somewhat uncomfortable to lean back in. It\'s not even as good as an airline seat IMHO.Ideally, you\'d want your center of mass to be able to rotate to behind the hinge point so that the chair can stay reclined without you having to push back with your feet, and this is not the case in the original, stock form. The fix is to take an oscillating tool with a bi-metal blade (or maybe you could use a jig saw, not sure) and chop those tabs off by another 1/4"". Now the chair leans back a proper amount, and there\'s still no risk of it tipping over (for me, at least). Obviously, this will void the warranty, so do it at your own risk. If you remove anything more than 1/4"", it might induce a tipping over backwards hazard (especially if you\'re larger than me) so you have been warned.I have no idea why they thought the extremely minimal amount of tilt was a good thing, or maybe it has to do with how far back the base is mounted to the seat, since it seems like the tilt mechanism is a standard part used in many different chairs. It remains to be seen if the chair holds up over time, but for now, after modification, it\'s quite comfy and I\'m looking forward to using it for a long while.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States March 19, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Wonderful Office Chair', 'author': 'casey coil', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Bought for my child that sits in it everyday to play games with his friends.

Back then, it was also made by Serta, and it was like sitting on a cloud, on that awesome microfiber upholstery. Though... No longer.Several years back that chair was great. It felt like I was sitting on a Serta mattress. Sure, it had a problem with the lifter/cylinder, where it would not keep the height of the chair and would slowly deflate. But, I had already owned the chair for like 3 - 4 years already at that point, and I feel I got good use out of it. I tried replacing the cylinder, but it was nigh impossible to remove the cylinder from the wheel base, so in the trash it went.Little over a year ago, I bought this chair again, because I really loved how comfortable it was. But, something changed in the seat design that seriously reduced how comfy it is. It feels hard, and prolonged periods of sitting are not recommended in this chair.It then also reminded me, of the forward portion of the arm rest that attaches to the seat, how it would dig into my thighs. I\'m not a super big guy, sure I\'m 6\'2"", and 235lbs, but it did make me remember how the arm rests weren\'t in the greatest positions for thick thighs.Fast forward to a couple of weeks ago... cylinder appears to leaking again, or just not staying where it\'s supposed to be. If I sit in the chair, I can expect the chair to slowly descend again... guess that part of the chair never got addressed either.Very sad... as I really used to think highly of this chair, and even with the thigh-issue, I thought it was still a super comfy chair... But, considering that the cylinder/lifter issue now seems like it\'s just a thing for this chair, and the fact that the upholstery just isn\'t the same anymore... very sad.I don\'t recommend getting this chair if you work from home, or sit in your office chair a lot.

I bought a sit-stand desk that lowers to 24.5"" which is about perfect for me but I could not find a chair that went low enough that allowed me to use that appropriate desk height, keep my feet on the floor, and my rear-end back in the seat so my back could be properly supported. THIS IS IT!!I just received the chair and it took about five minutes to put together. Finally, a chair that fits my body and isn\'t made for larger people. The shorter seat (from front edge to back rest) is perfect and allows me to fully sit back in the chair (versus standard sizes not allowing my knees to properly bend or I\'d be leaning back to use the backrest to keep my knees bent - neither option good for posture). The seat is narrow (side to side) but it fits me perfectly. The backrest comes to my mid back, which I prefer, allowing me to stretch backward and move around. The curve of the backrest is perfect and supportive.I like the removable seat cover (pets in the house AND easy to replace if the padding should wear out or I want to add extra padding or add some flair with a custom cover). It fits well and is snug.It doesn\'t roll great on carpet, but I didn\'t expect it to and don\'t really care.My request - the same version with ELBOW rests. Not full arm rests because the chair is too petite for that. However, some narrow, padded, foldable elbow rests could easily be added to the chair back and provide just a bit of support to arms when in a long typing session. My other request - make a more robust version that still goes this low but offers tilt back, a higher backrest, full size foldable arms, etc. and charge appropriately for it. I think the company would be surprised at consumers looking for that exact product.

I specifically wanted a chair that had some adjustable lumbar support, mild padding, and had fold up arms to be able to tuck it away in our small space.The lumbar support is adjustable and what I was looking for! ✅The padding does leave something to be desired. 🟨I wanted support, but not rock hard; which is honestly what I got when I first got it. After 7 months of frequent use, the padding has definitely lost its heft and it's not suuuper comfortable to sit on for long periods anymore. I'd blame this on the price point- a more expensive chair would likely have a higher quality, longer lasting seat cushion. This can also be remedied by buying an aftermarket cushion (I'm currently pricing some out because the chair is still great in all other aspects.)The arms fold up perfectly, they're not flimsy and they don't fall down on their own. ✅One of the other big things was I needed a chair that was on the shorter side at its lowest point. I'm short, my desk is short, and lots of chairs are just too tall at their lowest. So that's a plus ✅Overall it gets 5 stars for the price point and what you're actually getting for the lower price.

This one has been by far the best one, long-term.- Mid-range in price: Not cheap, but half the cost of most executive-style chairs.- Easy assembly: I put it together myself in under an hour and took my time doing so. You will need a good amount of open space and either a bed/table for comfortable assembly, but that feels like a ""given"" to me as opposed to a drawback.- Comfortable all day: I both WFH at my desk and most of my hobbies are done at a desk. I am in this chair 8+ hours a day (with plenty of breaks for stretching) and it\'s very comfortable. I have had chairs in the past that exacerbated my back pain, have cut off circulation in my legs, etc. but this one has never given me those problems.- Folding arms: The arms of the chair fold up and down at your will and will remain there. Not slippery at all, but not a chore to move. Great for tucking the chair away once you\'re done with it, if you need just one arm, or whatever.- Smooth rolling: The chair rolls around smoothly on hardwood but doesn\'t go sliding like the floor\'s been waxed. Feels like a good balance for mobility, both when seated and when standing and moving it around.- Breathable backing: Back of the chair has a soft mesh that\'s pulled taut. Provides breathability in the hotter months and decent support when you lean back against it.Overall, I really like this chair.

The instructions on assembly are extremely easy to follow, though the deign of how the back and seat connect is through the L piece that has the arm rests which is a little weird to get on there due to the shape of the parts it connects to but is easier then chairs that connect from back to bottom. Ergonomics wise the chair is a little firm for my taste in how much force it takes to lean back, since I use it for my personal PC I like to lean back in my chairs quite a bit, but with this one even on the lowest tension I'd have to push back on something with noticeable force to stayed lean back. This isn't the biggest issue as it was only ruining my posture doing that, and I would say it's much more suited to office spaces because of it. Only complaint I have is that the arm rests are a little to close together for me to use. I am a rather big man with wide shoulder, so to use them properly I have to scrunch up a little. They aren't so close as to touch my side, though if you happened to be a person of a weight that was larger on the spectrum, then you might encounter a problem there; however if you do have this problem you can also just lean up the arm rest as there is a pivot on them to lean them up and down if you don't want to use them.

But let me back up a bit.I originally purchased this chair since the graphic (with the measurements) showed that it\'s lowest height from floor to seat top was 14.9"" (and it\'s been getting more difficult to find chairs that go low; my prior chairs all went down to 14"" as measured from floor to the top of the seat cushion). I\'m of average height (170cm or 5\'6"") so I tend to like sitting lower. Additionally, my computer desk is 25"" from the floor to the desk top (so I need a chair that has a seat that is no higher than 15"" in order for me to be at a comfortable position to use my computer).As it turned out when I assembled the chair (which overall was pretty straightforward, except for the cumbersome part of securing the seat back with the arm rests to the seat bottom), the lowest position was 17"" (the 14.9"" is actually from floor to the bottom part under the cushion); it was a bit too high for my computer desk. That is when I reached out to XISHE (via their e-mail address included in the setup pamphlet since like many others, the product support link on Amazon takes you to a different company).The service representative went out of their way to find out what my problem was, and wanted to make it right (I explained how the seat at the lowest position, was way too high for my desk setup compared to my prior chair - I sent a photo comparing the two side by side). I didn\'t even mention to them I was considering returning the chair since I wanted to see how they would try to resolve this. XISHE offered to refund a portion of the chair so that I could purchase a suitable cylinder. This offer actually took me by surprise; I decided to give that a try since it would be easier than disassembling the chair, repacking everything, and then returning it (which I know something of this size is a pain since Amazon uses UPS for this type of return).After searching around (and reading up on cylinder stroke), I bought this 2.5"" cylinder https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B1M2NQZX which is one of the shortest ones available with the standard 1.2"" sinking on the housing (some cylinders are 2.4"" sinking where more of the cylinder drops through the base), and it did the trick where the lowest position has the top of the seat at 15"" from the floor.Initially, the chair felt uncomfortable because my previous seat didn\'t actually have good support at the front (but my legs had gotten used to that). It took around a week to re-adjust, and then another week for the seat to break in. Now one month later, this chair is comfortable. I did buy a seat cover (I normally prefer fabric material versus leather/faux or real) to round out the personal comfort aspect.

It's definitely designed for 2 people to make it a bit easier, as I had to wrap my hand around both the back rest and the bottom to squeeze the two together to get the bolts in. Two bolts felt like they had stripped, but upon further twisting, they eventually locked into their final position (I'm guessing this is where some of the complaints about stripping come from, they just didn't twist far enough in...it's really surprising how deep the actual bolts go in, and how many turns it takes to finally settle them in).I will say the instructions were on a similar level to what La-Z-Boy provides, which is a nice touch. Easy to read, lots of solid details. They also came with a fair amount of extra parts, and the quality of the parts seemed decent. My only gripe is the plastic nubs to fit into the holes where the bolts go in, are not properly fitted, and most pop out on their own. It was very difficult to get them into place for the lower two sockets, and in attempting to force them into the upper holes where the moving armrest is ended up forcing me to use a small hammer, and I still couldn't get them to fit properly. Even swapping them out. I stopped trying as I ended up nicking the exterior slightly and did not feel like doing any extra exterior damage in a vain attempt. That said, they aren't really necessary. It looks fine with the holes around the movable armrest and the two bolts into the seat sealed off.The build quality is fairly decent. The exception seems to be the seat area. The sides and back of the seat have ample and adequate cushion and foam. However the center has almost nothing. I suppose this was a way to cut corners, and most large sized individuals tend to be thicker on the edges of their bums, rather than have more weight around the center, and most people will sit further back into the chair (were again, there is adequate cushioning). However once I move a little further into the center, as I tend to sit forward, that center cushion deflates really fast, and it's like sitting on a rock.The back support took some time to get used to. It's very thick foam in the lower back region, and it leans a bit backwards for what I'm used to (most of the chairs I buy are more straight backed). So it took a little time to get used to. It's not bad, but feels a bit off. I'm guessing this is designed to alleviate lower back pain, though it's a bit much, and pushes me forward, where when I lean forward into the seat, and given the angle of the seat's rear cushion, really pushes me into that center with limited cushioning. So I have to be very mindful of how I sit in this chair.I haven't had it long, so I'm not sure how well the foam will hold up. I had to replace a rather nice faux leather high back, but metal frame chair where the joint where the arm bolt is connected into the back is where some corners were cut (it's the width of the bolt itself, and of a lower grade material, not steel, so it broke with just a slight force application). This chair seems to be a bit more durable. However, it's plastic, with the only metal being the bolts and the screw holds meant to hold the thing together. So I'm not positive on longevity.The company that makes this chair is American, but its made in China. Though the quality is decent, and the thickness of the faux leather seems fairly solid, and difficult to rip or tear, though I'm not about to take a knife to it to properly test but some tugging and pulling indicates it will last awhile, even in dry weather.The rating itself is based on the price to quality.

It kind of gives me this sensation of just leaning/falling forward a bit too much. I also worry about the long term wear and tear it will have with this kind of tilt.I originally rated this 5 Stars but I'm lowering it to 1. One star because the chair gets kind of uncomfortable after a while. Uncomfortable to the point where my lower back starts killing me and I have to get up every 30 minutes. I tried a lot of different things to fix it including talking with support who reached out to me and mailed me a few new pieces no questions asked which was nice of them. However trying to fix this chair just became a second job and wasn't worth the amount of time I was putting into it. Between the 20ish emails I sent back and forth with support (only 1 email a day they don't seem to respond back on the same day), and then replacing two pieces of the chair which required me to remove the cylinder twice (not sure if you've ever removed a cylinder but it's not the easiest task). I probably spent more of my time than what this chair was even worth. I threw it away and ordered a new one because I'm not wasting anymore time trying to get a refund.I'd like it to just sit perfectly flat.

Also, the tilt control is very stiff and does not offer much back tilt. Overall, chair is not at all so.

It feels like it will hold up well over time even if you\'re on the more-to-love side.* Mesh back is comfortable and doesn\'t make me sweat like the faux leather upholstered chairs tend to.* Reclining feature is adjustable and strong. I had no problems setting it to a firmness that allows me to lean my weight into it without it flexing. Time will tell how well it holds up.* Arms are comfortable, removable, and adjustable for height.* Neck support is comfortable, removable and adjustable for height and angle. It feels solid and still has a few inches of extension left at the setting I use.* Assembly is easy. It requires a single allen key (included) for all of the bolts and a phillips head screwdriver for the neck support adjustment.* No tacky ""gamer"" branding or obnoxious accents. It would fit in in a professional setting.Negatives:* You have to remove the neck support from the chair back to adjust it. It can take a few times of screwing and unscrewing the bolts to get it right. Don\'t install the plastic cover piece until you have it dialed in. You\'ll know what I\'m talking about when you see it.* The upholstery is basic cloth and has a somewhat rough texture.* The arms only adjust up and down, no 3D adjustment. This hasn\'t been a problem for me, but it\'s worth noting.* Lumbar support is attached by a thin sheet of springy plastic. It does the job, but I could see the plastic fatiguing over time.Overall, I\'d compare this favorably to the more expensive Ikea Markus chair that it replaced.At the price (around $100 at the time of this review), it\'s an easy 5 stars.I\'ll update this review if my opinion changes.PS: Not sponsored or compensated.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States July 21, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars A Game-Changer for Comfort and Productivity!', 'author': 'Joseph', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I recently purchased the Dripex Ergonomic Chair, and it has truly transformed my distance learning experience.

As the saying goes, ""You get what you pay for,"" and the SMUG Ergonomic Mesh Office Chair is a prime example of a budget option that sacrifices comfort and durability for affordability.In conclusion, the SMUG Ergonomic Mesh Office Chair may be an economical choice, but its lack of comfort, particularly for users over 150lbs, and its subpar durability make it a less-than-ideal option for daily use. If you prioritize comfort and long-lasting support, investing in a higher-quality chair may be a better choice in the long run.Edit: After initially writing my review, their customer support team reached out to me in an effort to provide a solution to my issue, I am very pleased with the solution I received and this level of customer service is commendable.

The material is good quality, I actually spilled some matcha on the armrest cloth piece and it came off nicely, the material is easy to clean. It comes with a cover to go on the seat cushion that is really cute and soft (make sure you put the cover on before you assemble the chair because you can’t once it’s put together). I personally took the head test off in the picture because I like to see more of my desk but there’s nothing wrong with it, It’s just a personal choice. Also the headrest is adjustable. One thing that could be better is the cushions on the arm rests they’re a little thin so the arm wrests are a kind of hard hard.

The tools were great quality and I was able to construct it alone with no issues.Visually, the chair looks nice. The colors pop, and it doesn\'t have a ""cheap"" look to it, despite its plastic and mesh design.When first sitting in the chair, it\'s comfortable. The seat cushion is slightly firm, but soft enough where I don\'t feel too much fatigue using it, especially during those long sitting sessions. The mesh seat back is nice, and I don\'t feel the pressure of the back\'s frame on my shoulder blades. The headrest is a nice touch, as it has a slight give to it, making it comfortable to lean into.After a few weeks, however, I\'m noticing I\'ve had some lower back strain/problems which I didn\'t have in my previous chair. So I\'m not very comfortable anymore. It\'s also affecting my sleeping positions, making it difficult to get comfortable and fall asleep quickly.A majority of my sitting time is spent cross-legged with my back pressed firmly against the backrest to keep my spine aligned, and doing so on this chair, I think, is partly causing the problem. Because of the discomfort, I\'m constantly changing my sitting position between ""proper"", leaned back, cross-legged, and leaned forward. With my old chair, I could sit cross-legged the entire time with my back pressed against the backrest the entire workday and not have any issues.There\'s an adjustable lower backrest, but it has some issues. For one, it doesn\'t stay in the position you keep it in, and you\'ll need to readjust it if you squirm around in the chair or get up and leave for a while (it will fall back into its lowest position on its own). Even keeping the back rest adjusted, I still can\'t find a comfortable position for long sitting sessions.Also, there are plastic covers for the joint screws on the swivel arms. These pop out constantly, falling to the ground. There\'s nothing to lock them into place aside from light tension. I\'ve hammered them on with my hands, but it only lasts for a day or so before falling off again. I\'ve resorted to taping them on.For its price, it may not be a terrible purchase, especially if you\'re not planning on sitting for actual office-length work day in and day out. However, I\'ll likely be looking for another chair. In the meantime, I\'m trying to switch to an orthopedic seat pillow and added armrest cushions to increase the longevity of it, but I don\'t like that I have to resort to these measures on a chair 1 month old. We\'ll see if the cushions help the lower back pain.Overall, it\'s not a terrible chair. You can do much worse, especially for the price. But for anyone looking for something comfortable for long sitting hours, I don\'t believe this will be your chair.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States July 27, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars This chair is superb for long sessions at the computer!', 'author': 'Holly', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I am delighted to report that the chair is exactly as advertised.

The headrest sits at the perfect height, and the lumbar support sticks out enough to do its job without digging into your back. One of my favorite perks is the arm rests being able to move up, they don’t move around either, they stay put when I move them up. I wiggle and move around a lot, and like to sit cross legged, so that’s extra convenient to be able to move them out of the way, but still have the armrests when I need them. It’s also nice to flip them up when I push my chair in at the end of the day. The pink color is really cute too! Both me and my son got new chairs at the same time, his is a different chair though.

Sherwood', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""Extremely impressed with packaging, instructions, quality of components, adjustability and appearance.I purchased the ivory white chair. Very impressed with packaging and assembly instruction booklet. My chair came with a removable seat cover. The seat cover was not covered in the instructions which causes me to think it might be specific to the white chair. I suggest if your chair comes with a cover, and you want to use it, put it on the seat before attaching the brackets. I put the brackets on first and realized the cover couldn't be pulled over the sides and back so I ended up removing them completely, adding the cover and reattached the brackets. At this point seems it will be on permanently.The assembly process was as good as could be expected, but not as simple as it looks in the video. I have ample experience assembling furniture and even with helpful instructions it probably took a couple hours all together. The base goes together easily, but assembling the brackets seat and back took some time. If I were to do another one would be quicker. A second set of hands to hold the back and seat steady while installing the arms would also speed up the process. Do not screw down tight until all the bracket screws are in. It took me quite a bit of adjusting and several attempts to get everything to fit.The seat does go up really high so if you're short like me and have trouble finding a high enough seat to sit ergonomically with arm placement to keyboard on a standard desk you will appreciate this chair.As much as I love the chair, I'm not sure I'd want to sit on it 9 hours a day. I can tell a difference between this chair and the one my company provided through our ergo program. I noticed the padding of the two chairs looks similar on the surface, but once I sat down, could feel this chair is less supportive in the seat. I'm guessing a lower density foam. It also feels a little wobbly. The base that attaches the seat to the post is small. The commercial chair has a hard plastic base.The work chair was also 4 times the price of this chair. For the price if you're on a small budget, this is an amazing chair. I am using only a few hours per week at my personal desk so it's working great for that application.Also, in case you're wondering, it can be assembled without the head rest, however if you don't add it, there will be two visible screw holes on the back. Initially my ponytail was hitting it, but raising it a bit solved that issue. The arms are permanently attached to the brackets that hold the seat and back together, so the only way to attach the back is to install the arms, but they do raise up easily. As for the back support, seems fine. I couldn't figure out how it worked but fortunately it felt fine straight out of the box. I'm 5'3 and short waisted for reference.All in all I highly recommend for casual use."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 1, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': ""4.0 out of 5 stars It's alright"", 'author': 'Amazon Customer', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'The chair itself is cute, I like the colors offered, but overall it really is just ""ok"". If you sit for long periods of time, it\'s comfortable, but after less than a month it\'s already started making creaking sounds. I\'ve tried WD-40 and adjusting, but the creaks sound more like an issue with the chair itself.It sits high; I\'m not a particularly tall person, but if you\'re under 5\'4"" then your feet will probably just barely brush the ground - and this is with it on the lowest possible setting. I ended up buying an ottoman for my desk to help with comfort.The arms are awkwardly short, and narrow, making it a bit uncomfortable for typing. The back is alright, but there is really not enough adjustment capabilities on this chair. You\'re either having to sit straight up, or essentially lay down. There is no in between settings if you just want to recline a bit. Ergonomically, this chair is pretty basic.Overall, I would have returned it. But the process of trying to put all the pieces back into the box it (snuggly) came in, was more of a hassle than I was willing to put in. For the price, I\'m not overly upset about it - it is what it is.

What really caught my attention is the fabric on the back – it's not just comfy, but also surprisingly stable. Unlike those solid surfaces that can make you feel like you're sticking to the chair, this fabric lets you breathe, and I'm all for that. And let's not forget about the build quality – top-notch. You can tell this chair was crafted with care. It's sturdy and reliable, which is just what you need when you're in the heat of battle. Plus, the amazing price for this level of build quality is the cherry on top.And the convenience factor? It's a breeze to put together. The assembly process is so straightforward, they practically laid out the whole thing like a map. Sections are clearly marked, and it's a smooth experience from start to finish. So, not only do you get a chair that pampers you during gaming marathons, but you also get one that doesn't make you sweat during setup.

They have just provided pictures of how the assembly should look in each step, but it would have been really helpful if they would have given more details about each step.The packaging comes with Wheels (5) , screws (divided into A, B, C) , washer (D) and an Allen wrench. I would expect each screw (i.e A,B and C) to be supported by washer (D) for better handling, but again here the instructions do not clearly show whether each screw should have Washer or not as there are not enough Washers as screws. So, I had to decide what part of the chair I can put the screw without the Washer, pretty bad from Customer perspective.Comfort:1. After putting this chair into an assembled state, I sat on it for 30 mins and boy, what a uncomfortable Memory Foam seat this is. It looks so fabulous, but the seat is absolutely uncomfortable to sit for long hours. The main reason people order chairs these days is sitting long hours due to Work From Home, but this is definitely not your chair if you expect to sit 6-8 hours a day working. Again, depends on how heavy you are, I am 188 Pounds, but if you are super lightweight, it may be a different story for you.2. Lumbar Support: The Lumbar Support is made of hard plastic, the moment I sat on the chair, it started pressing hard on my back hurting me more than supporting me. Pretty bad design, material choice by the manufacturer.3. Arm rest - The Arm Rest is same as the Lumbar Support. Made of hard plastic, without consideration for any soft support OR wide enough to support multiple forearms, thus someone like me who is heavy, has a much bigger forearm then someone skinny. Thus, the arm rest hurts you as well.4. Stiching - The Stiching on the seat is clearly visible, and thus an unpleasant thing to look at, though it doesn't make any issues while sittingAll in All, this is bad chair for medium / heavy people and should stay away from it if you are looking for comfortable chair in these times of WFH."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 15, 2020', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '3.0 out of 5 stars Very comfy for a cheap chair, arrived ripped', 'author': 'Kyle Weber', 'rating': 3, 'content': 'I like this chair, Semi comfortable, easy to assemble.

It was flat, super uncomfortable, heavy, the arm rests were loose and the chair made constant creaking sounds that were so loud that I had to mute my mic during meetings. I finally had enough and set out looking for something more mature, better made, but not too expensive. This NEO Chair came up in my initial search, and I really like the modern look, and it has lots of positive feedback, but for $60 I assumed it was probably another junk chair. More searching showed chairs that looked identical with the same features, but for more money, so I decided I’d take the chance on the NEO chair, and I’m SO glad I did! This chair is AWESOME! It arrived in perfect shape. I was surprised at the small amount of screws that were needed for assembly, which means there’s less moving parts that can loosen over time. It literally took me 6 minutes to assemble the chair, and I agree with others that the directions could be better to show the orientation for the arm rests. When I sat in it for the first time I was amazed. The chair is super comfortable, and fits my medium build just perfectly. The padding of the chair is great. Not too soft, not too hard. The seat bottom has a small well/depression close to the seat back, which anchors me in the chair as if it was built for me. I noticed the bracket to mount the seat has slots for the bolts, so you can position the seat bottom forward or backwards slightly to accommodate the length of your thighs. While it’s only about 1/2” worth of adjustment, it’s nice to have a little adjustability. The casters glide smoothly, and the chair swivels effortlessly. I was concerned that the immovable lumbar support wouldn’t match my physique, but the mesh back is super comfortable and the lower back support is right where it needs to be. The mesh back also keeps my back from sweating, and since I’m in the seat for 8 hours a day, this is a great feature. As others have noted, the arm rests are too low to rest my elbows on when typing, but that’s a sniggle I can live with considering how much this chair does right, along with the price point. I’ve only had the chair for a week now, so the longevity/ quality of the chair is yet to be determined, with my main concern being if the padding in the chair will not lose it’s cushioning over time, and that the mesh seat back wont stretch over time and lose it’s elasticity.

Guests that have used these chairs here at our kitchen table also love them -- we've gotten many, many unsolicited compliments. In that some of the chair's design features are like those of a high- quality desk or office chair and not of a typical traditional chair that you'd normally find at a kitchen table, I was not sure when I ordered them whether my wife would like them as dining table chairs, and how they would look in a kitchen/dining area setting.

Metal components are in gauges that will stand the test of time, and assembly was straight-forward, with clear and easy to follow instructions. Everything aligned, and though the claim is that the chair can be assembled in 20 minutes, plan on the better part of an hour. This isn't a negative, just a reality. Each fastener has a lock-tite type material applied, and seating the fasteners by hand will take a bit of time. All parts aligned, and assembly was straight-forward. We found that on attaching the back, loosely starting the top fasteners, and then swinging the back pad rearward made locating the second attachement holes much easier than the books recommendation of doing the lower fittings, first. The chair is attractive in color and design, wide in the seat, supportive on the back, and the padded armrests help when typing. We are book authors, so 'fit' and comfort are very important for long stretches of writing. To loosen the tilt on the back, have someone seated in the chair, and a second person to reach under and rotate the tension assembly. The tension knob is very tight, and a firm grip is needed to turn it, however, it works wonderfully. Now, we'll see how the fabric holds up.

Said instructional booklet also has photos of the corresponding parts you’ll need for each step, and kindly caps-locked warnings about sections where things might get a little wonky. It’s clear and easy to read, even with small grammatical errors here and there. (And this is coming from someone not very technically inclined.)Customer Service: I can speak to firsthand experience with the customer service team. I received two right armrests in my original package, I reached out to the included email about getting me a left-armrest and they got back to me within around 24-hours. If I remember this was near the Easter weekend as well, and yet the response was still timely. They got my shipping information, reconfirmed that I did have two right armrests through photo, and then sent out a tracking number for my missing part. Aside from that, there’s still a five year warranty in play that comes with the chair, and I’m willing to believe they’ll honor it based on my interaction with them thusfar.Comfort and Ergonomics: Like I mentioned in my brief bullet-points, there’s a number of different adjustments that can be made to the chair itself. They’re thoughtful and considerate. Perhaps not as expansive as everyone would need, though more than enough for my purposes. The cushion on both the armrests and the chair bottom itself is plush and comfortable. I think the material of the cushions, being leather, is a bit less breathable than the mesh back-rest, but the plushness makes up for that and it’s nothing that a blanket can’t fix. I didn’t think I’d like the headrest, being of a shorter height (a few inches over five feet) I expected that it’d be too high for me to even use. Surprisingly, it does adjust low enough that I can comfortably use it in a wide range of positions, and the transfer from angles happens naturally. I used the chair for hours on end, and I couldn’t complain about it at the end of the day, as opposed to others, so it passes my checks for comfort.Value: At the full price point, there are a few small quips that I think leave it as a four out of five for me. In one of my photos, you can see a protruding metal part, that is meant to be where one of the screws for the headrest should go, and it should be built flush into the plastic, not at a place where it might jab into my back or neck with a bit too much leaning, and a thin mesh film separate. I used a slightly longer screw (one of the spares for a different part) and it held the headrest tight, or else it would have wobbled with the intended screw. Where the headrest sits for me, I don’t anticipate it being an issue since there’s two layers of protection, though it’s not the best vouch of quality control. I tested the wheels on both wood floor and the carpet of my office. Maybe it’s because they’re new, but it moves a bit like that odd-cart in a grocery store that has a tendency to drift. Aside from that, the lumbar support feels a bit flimsy, given that it is only a piece of plastic, but it has made me more conscious of my own posture. In general, all the adjustments that you can make all have this feeling of being a bit, loosey-goosey. The armchairs flip up, and they stay, though there’s something about the motion that doesn’t quite have a full clickiness that gives me the sense they’re secure and will stay that way for long. Likewise changing your reclining angle and tilt feels a bit odd even though the lock itself seems secure. The metal and leather portions of the chair feel well-made though, and I appreciate that.Again, I think that the few quirks of my experience mean I might have considered this chair, an overall, 4.75 rather than outright 5, though there’s a lot of things that the chair and the company behind it are doing well, so I’m rounding up. I think that it’s numerous adjustments and features would make it suitable for many people and I will continue to happily use it throughout its lifespan!', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States April 21, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars CYKOV Office Chair is well built, great features, great buy', 'author': 'LAH', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I ordered this CYKOV Office chair to replace my old one.

I chose this chair over others because of it's price, the discount I got, the overall style of the chair and the weight limit. I am about 300lbs so I needed something with that weight limit. The chair has a pretty big seat and the arm rest don't constrict my torso or thighs. I am even able to sit with one leg under me. The seat cushion could be better, it's a bit hard and not soft or bouncy, more of a sturdy leather. It took me about 20-30 minutes to put it all together, all the screws and the Allen wrench were included. I was worried about the piston part, the mechanism that allows the chair to go up and down but surprisingly that was the easiest part of the assembly. The headrest is a little weird, it feels comfortable when I'm able to rest my head on it but I can only do so if I'm leaning back and have my head back but it's really adjustable so that's good.

This chair is very comfortable, adjustable and upgradable. I could stop my review now, but I want to share my experiences with this supplier/manufacturer.Last year I purchased a different model chair, from this supplier. During my registration process I had the opportunity, via email, to ask questions. To my surprise, they actually replied to me the next day. All my questions were answered and advised them to contact them if I had any other concerns. About a year later, my chair started to tilt to one side. So, remembering my email conversation I had with them the previous year, I figured I was out of warranty and the worst thing they could tell me was they couldn’t help me, I decided to contact them again.I was shocked when they replied to me the next and gave me great news. They diagnosed the problem with the chair & sent me a replacement part, at no charge. The package would take about a week to receive it. I received a UPS tracking number and waited a couple of weeks. The UPS website stated they had received the package, but was waiting to be shipped. I gave it a few more days. UPS still had not shipped it. I contacted a live agent who told me I needed to file a claim if I wanted to have them investigate. I felt this would be a waste of time & resources.I contacted the chair customer support team & explained the situation. They said they would contact the manufacturer & ask for another replacement part to be sent. During our email conversation, they apologized for the delay several times & asked me if I would be interested in a chair upgrade with a $50 special promotion discount. I was intrigued by their offer & agreed to order the 2023 upgraded chair. I informed them I would repair the original chair and donate it someone who could use it. They also informed me once I ordered another chair & provide the order #, they would also provide me with another big discount in exchange for a product review with pictures. I felt this was reasonable since have taken great care of me during the entire process.A few days later, I ordered the upgraded 2023 model & notified their customer service support team. They were delighted I kept my word and gave them the Amazon Order #.Customer service is a huge deal to me. I am a retired Senior Customer Service Manager. I have dealt with all kinds of customers personalities, in my 50+ years of serving the community… both in person at their homes & businesses as well as on the phone. This time I was the customer. This company made me feel valued & like a member of their family. Many of Amazon reviews show pictures of the products & tell you how great they are. I wanted my review to be a little different. I hope this review tells you how great their customer support is (and their products). I think it is important for you to know how you are actually treated after the sale is completed.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States June 30, 2023', 'is_verified': True}]"

I have a Secret Lab Titan XL 2020 chair, wife wanted an upgrade for hers but didn\'t think the Secret Lab chairs are worth what they charge, so she wanted to buy this one. I\'m pleased to say this chair is an excellent value. Pictures attached show it side-by-side with my Secret Lab chair for comparison. I know some will argue this is not apples-to-apples, but I know there will be people out there like us doing the same sort of comparisons on chairs. This char is big - plenty wide enough for a large person and still be very comfortable. I\'ve included pics with measurements so you can get a feel for the size of it compared to whatever you\'ve got now. The seller offers optional upgraded wheels and a shorter lifter, and we decided to go with that. We have used the roller-blade style wheels in the past on other chairs and knew they were a solid upgrade. The shorter lifter offsets the added height of the better wheels. Wifey is only 5\'3"", so I wanted to make sure the chair was low enough to remain comfortable. As seen in pics, height is about 20"" at lowest and 22.5"" at highest (keep in mind this is with those roller-blade wheels and shorter lifter, NOT stock out-of-the-box). The metal bracket that connects the back to the bottom is very thick steel and heavy - no concerns with durability there. It has 5-legs which is good to prevent any tipping, the legs are steel not plastic and seem well made. The main underseat bracket that the stem inserts into is also steel and seems like it will hold-up long term. Wife says the added pillow is very nice and great for additional lumbar support. She said even though it\'s not real leather, the material is nice - it does not feel cheap or plasticky. She also commented the arms are great as well - padded and they feel durable when you lift yourself out of the chair. Since the arms have a V shape bracket, they do not have any wobble and feel very solid. Seller\'s customer service is top-notch. When I reached out to them after purchase to inquire about the optional wheels & lifter, they responded very quickly and immediately shipped those items out. They were shipped from California, so I received them in just a few days, so I didn\'t have to wait long to assemble the chair. They also sent a follow-up email to make sure I received the parts and was able to assemble the chair with no issues. I would not hesitate to recommend this chair to anyone, it is a great value for the price and the great customer service is really the icing on the cake. I think we could have done without the leg rest, I don\'t think my wife will ever use that feature - they could probably save a few bucks making that an optional upgrade like the wheels & lifter. I\'d also love to see another model with a high-quality cloth like Secret Labs has instead of the imitation leather, but that\'s just my own personal preference.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 8, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Overall Satisfied', 'author': 'Maduhsun', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'I saw this chair and what stood out first was the color. This shade of orange is hard to find in a desk/gaming chair so I was hopeful that the comfort and quality of the chair would also be decent. It was pretty easy to assemble. I assembled by myself and it took about 50 minutes. The directions weren’t the clearest but I’ve had my fair share of item assembly through the years, so a bit of common sense and general knowledge makes it easy. Comfort is definitely an upgrade from my previous chair. I will say it’s not as plush as it looks in the picture but I don’t need to add a pillow under me to withstand sitting in a chair anymore. Quality is nice on the fabric and other pieces. It doesn’t look cheap or anything like that. The one thing that is a bit frustrating is the recline mechanism. You have to push/pull a lever to unlock the recline ability and then push it back and lock it where you need it. Not as simple or quick as other chairs are. I also wish it had a pillow or more cushioning in the neck area of the chair. My old chair had a pillow up there and it was a nice feature. The foot rest makes up for that though and adds a whole lot of comfort for me personally. Having the ability to stretch out and prop up my feet is so great. I am small and short so the length of the foot rest isn’t an issue for me, but I could see someone taller not having the best functionality with it. Overall I’m definitely happy with this purchase!

It does offer some nice lumbar support, however, this chair isn't all the hype people claim it is. The seat for your bum goes flat rather quickly, leaving you sitting on hard surface and not really supporting you in a way you feel it should. I felt for the price of this chair I would be sitting on a supportive cloud. It really isn't all that. The leg rest feels flimsy and the chair leans forward somewhat when you use it unless you're leaning back. Also, the back support while ok for the lumbar offers nothing for your upper back or neck unless again, you're leaning back in the chair.

Having previously bought a chair for myself from the same company, I was already confident in the quality of their products, but this chair has exceeded even my high expectations.Firstly, the assembly process was a breeze, thanks to the super clear instructions provided. It was a straightforward and hassle-free experience, which is always a plus when dealing with furniture assembly.The chair\'s ergonomic design is its standout feature. It encourages an ""S-Shaped"" spinal posture, crucial for maintaining a healthy spine, especially during long hours of study or work. The adjustable headrest is a game-changer, providing optimal neck and head support, something that is often overlooked in other chairs. Additionally, the lumbar support is customizable, which is fantastic for lower back support, promoting good posture, and reducing strain.Breathability is another significant aspect of this chair. The mesh backrest ensures proper ventilation and airflow, keeping the user cool and comfortable throughout the day. This feature, combined with the high-density foam that contours to the body, provides unparalleled comfort and support. It\'s impressive how it manages to alleviate pressure and reduce fatigue, promoting proper blood circulation and minimizing discomfort, even after extended periods of sitting.The space-saving design is another notable benefit. The flip-up armrests allow the chair to be slid under a desk when not in use, saving valuable space in a home office environment. Furthermore, these armrests are ergonomically designed, providing comfortable support for the arms and wrists.Overall, this Home Office Chair is a fantastic investment for anyone looking to enhance their work-from-home experience.

Also, the thought of returning it was not appealing.Fast forward to the second day I used the chair... I sat down and slowly sank down like I had sat in quicksand. The seat's hydraulic gas lift had failed. I contacted the seller who asked if I would try replacing the hydraulic. I figured I'd give it a try but once that hydraulic piece is in and has been sat on, good luck getting it out. I couldn't do it so I had no choice but to return the chair. And that's when the real fun began. Since I was unable to completely unassemble the chair, it wouldn't fit into the original box. In hindsight, I should have taken a saw to it but I digress. I took the chair to UPS and had them box it up, which cost me $27 and change. I was confident that Amazon's A to Z policy would ensure a refund of the UPS boxing costs, but I was wrong. My claim was denied and the seller refused to refund the UPS boxing costs. So... this fiasco wound up costing me $27+, and I have nothing to show for it except a few bucks added to the swear jar.

So, I am only reviewing the materials and assembly at this point.MATERIALS: The build of this chair is quite good. All parts are heavy cast metal. The cushions are heavily padded, firm and strong, and the leather is of good quality (altho just starting using).ASSEMBLY: This chair is similar to most others, first the base is assembled and the wheels attached. I highly recommend that you discard the included wheels and spend about $25 on AMZ to get roller-blade style wheels, much easier to move around and less damage to flooring. I really liked that they included a \'spare parts\' section to the screw packaging insert. Most all suppliers give you an extra screw and other spares, but they mix with the normal section. One thing ... this manufacturer includes a basic ""L"" hex wrench, but another one (SIHOO) includes a T-handle wrench that makes it so much easier to work with. As it happens, I also just bought a SIHOO chair for another work-space and had the T-handle wrench around to use (apparently they all use the same size hex screws). I was able to assemble in less than 30 minutes total. The only challenging step was attaching the back cushion. As noted in the instructions, the manner to attach the back cushion is that you lay it flat on the seat, and then attached the top screws on the back cushion. Then, you swing it up (pivoting on the top screws that you loosely attached) and then insert and attached the bottom screws on the back cushion. The issue is that the back cushion is so bulky from padding that it may not easily fit into place. The trick is that the side armrests must be very loosely attached, to allow the bottom of the back cushion to fit into place. THEN AND ONLY THEN you actually tighten all of the screws for armrests and the top screws of the back cushion. Do that, and its easy!NOTE: As this is a chair for big folks (altho nicely rated at 400lbs capacity) you may decide to buy and use one of the available heavy/max capacity lift cylinders, which AMZ has many. I had bought the one that is rated as 1000lbs, and was a 5.5 inch model (vs. 4.7 inch model). In considering to use it during the assembly, I immediately noticed that it sat in the wheel base much higher, so the resulting seat position would be about 4 inches higher, even at lowest seat position. My spidey senses cautioned me that with the seat being much higher, the amount of the lift cylinder would be much smaller in the wheel base. Thinking this thru, that would possibly result in much more torque and stress on the length of the cylinder between the base and the seat cushion base. I opted to just go with the 400lb included lift cylinder. In the end, that was the best decision as even using the included lift cylinder, I had to lower the chair to sit at correct height at my standard work desk. First time that has ever happened, actually - prolly because the seat cushion is very padded and you will sit up higher just because of that. (Can only imagine with the bigger one, would be too high even at lowest setting.)CONCLUSION: High quality build materials, relatively easy to assemble, and sits nicely.

It took some effort to get the holes aligned so the screws would go in smoothly. A second pair of hands would have simplified it. Not a big deal really.I will update my review sometime in the future. FWIW I’m 5’11”, 248lbs. My hope is, that the seat cushion doesn’t degrade over time. At the moment I’m sitting in the chair tilted back with my legs resting on the side of my bed. I wish the head rest was a little higher.

I am a 59 year old female.They include the Allen wrench and all hardware plus a few extra pieces. I read on an earlier review to READ THE DIRECTIONS FIRST, That always works better when assembling anything. Do not totally tighten the screws for the seat and sides until you have the seat back in place and screwed in. Then you can tighten all of the chair screws.I purchased this chair not only for the great price but because of the features. I am a large woman and need something not only sturdy but comfortable as well. The seat back is adjustable so you can select which position is best for you as well as the seat height.

I had to find out the hard way when I kept shifting around and realized that my back felt strained after a couple hours of sitting (I work 8 hours a day at the desk, never felt this type of discomfort in any chair).The issue is that the lumbar support sits way too low (I\'m 5\' 8\'\' for reference) and forces you to slide down in your seat and lean back to get it in the proper position (right above the small on your back). However, that is also improper sitting posture and will cause issues/pain. The lumbar support is not adjustable, so I took it off completely, just to find out that there is hard plastic that your spine will touch unless the lumbar support is there.You may be wondering, ""Why don\'t you just return it and buy another?"" and you\'re absolutely correct. I sit for long periods at a time, all the time, so a good chair is a necessity.

I’m your average female, not someone who puts things together like this very often and I have long nails - didn’t break a nail and had no trouble with instructions. You get the tool and all the bolts needed and the assembly instructions are excellent. I have wide fat hips and a fat butt and I fit so comfortably in this chair. Usually office chairs squeeze me but this one does not. I am not even close to the weight limit on this chair so it feels very sturdy. It rolls amazingly smoothly on these rubber casters. Very smooth swivel. Arm height is not adjustable though so if that’s important to you, this may not be for you. For me they are just fine because I type all day and my elbows can rest lightly on these. I am 5’7” and sitting in the chair at the lowest seat height, my feet can sit flat on the floor and my knees are bent at probably 85 degrees. I do use a foot rest to keep my feet propped up for circulation reasons so this height is great. For someone taller you could adjust the height but if you’re shorter than 5’7” you might have dangly legs. I especially love the front part of the seat being able to touch the backs of my knees, and that’s because there’s enough depth to accommodate my big bottom. Most office chairs I end up far forward because the depth isn’t made for a larger person. And the seat width is great as well, I have very wide hips and there’s no pinching. The seat back is high enough that if I let my head rest on it there is still an inch of chair back above the top of my head. I like the faux leather material (I chose the ivory color) and hope it holds up well, time will tell. I work from home 3 days a week so we will see how it goes.

I\'ve kind of settled into it a bit, so it\'s conforming to my body better but hasn\'t lost any support. Very comfortable for long days, no pain at all. All the bolts seem tight and nothing is showing any immediate wear. I anticipate this chair being perfect for my WFH desk job for a long time.It\'s day 1 with this chair, so I\'ll update my review later if my impressions change, but here\'s what I\'ve noticed:First: This chair is comfortable. The seat is as padded as it looks in the picture, the back holds you at a good angle and is comfy to lean back against. The chair rocks easily with just enough degrees of motion to be comfortable without making you feel like you\'ll fall backwards. It\'s cozy but not hot to sit on. Overall, it feels great.Something to note: This chair is for TALL people. I am 5\'10"" and even I have to scoot back a little bit when I sit in this chair. It sits high from the floor even at the lowest setting. The good news about that is you\'ll never have to worry about sinking when the hydraulic fails someday. For most tall people, the lowest setting is still perfectly fine. I personally cannot imagine using the highest setting.The cushion at the front does its job of supporting my legs, but it also is the reason I have to scoot a little bit to get all the way in!The rubber castors are absolutely silent and roll extremely easily. It does seem like they also add to the height a little bit, so perhaps this could be changed if you didn\'t want to sit so high.Construction of the chair was mostly very simple. The one thing I\'ll note is that when they say not to screw in the bolts all the way until you get everything lined up, they mean it! If you tighten everything all the way as you go, you\'ll find the last two bolts at the bottom of the back of the chair impossible to line up. Give it some breathing room until you get all the bolts partially in.Here\'s another caveat for anyone it applies to - I love this chair, but if I could change one thing, I wish the arms were another inch further apart. The seat itself is 23"" wide, but the arms are bolted close-in so they are only 22"" wide. This is mostly fine, but I am a big woman with very wide hips, so my thighs press into the arms a bit. This is NOT painful - I feel fine - but I worry about eventually pushing the bolts out where the arms are attached.So I\'d recommend this chair for anyone who can comfortably sit in chairs of 22"" width, and are between the heights of 5\'8"" and 6\'4"". The weight capacity feels correct. For reference, I am 350 pounds with my weight carried mostly in my hips. If your weight is in your stomach you\'ll be slightly more comfortable than a pear-shaped person but ultimately I think it\'s fine either way.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 31, 2022', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Office Chair - Adjustable Lumbar Support Heavy Duty Metal Base', 'author': 'Sparkle', 'rating': 4, 'content': ""So this is an early review.

Thank you for the communication.First off:Chair is comfy, wide enough to fit a 6'3 260lbs man comfortably. Arm rests are supportive, however they are fixed, this can mess with your desk height. The riser on the chair I wish was higher, my knees do not sit at a 90 degree angle as this is short.After 8 months of use, this chair is falling apart to an extent. The chair leans to the right a significant amount, about 2 inches, when measured with the arm rests under my desk. It is not ergonmimic at all. This is a great chair for executives who can lounge, but the person who is sat in it for 8hrs a day, it does not support your lower, mid or upper back. Also the lever to adjust height is extremely bendable metal, as this is advertised as a heavy duty chair, it is incredibly weak and bends after daily use of the chair, which in turn causes the chair (when it a locked upright position) to recline slightly backwards. This is HORRBILE for your back and neck and you are no longer sitting up straight and in an ergonomic position.TLDR: Chair is great and comfy and big enough. Wish the riser was taller as this is advertised as big and tall, and over time the adjustment lever bends, and chair leans to the right which makes this ergonomically terrible. If you are spending this type of money on a chair, just buy a standing desk or a herman miller or some chair that has better ergonomics."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 5, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Comfy and sturdy', 'author': 'STEPHANIE J', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'This chair was easy to put together.

There are two office chairs at my job that I have sit in for 8 hours; neither one of them causes the tailbone pain, so it is not entirely my weight causing the discomfort. I woud have returned the chair if it wasn't a hassle to ship it, but I held onto it. I have to find a chair cushion and lumbar support to sit in this chair, because using only a chair cushion rises you enough that built-in lumber support no longer aligns with spine, regardless of what height you set it. I have tried several cushions and none have helped with the tailbone pain. I am probably going to have buy cushion that $60+, meaning I should have just spent more money on a chair. The headrest on this chair is practically useless, as is mounted far too back to support your neck unless you tilt all the way back.

Huge plus is that the seat is much thicker than I thought, and very comfy. I also like that the seat isn’t like those scratchy mesh material that leaves marks when you wear shorts. It’s very comfy and I can sit cross legged or just prop one leg up. So far super comfy for sitting in it for hours. The chair holds my back well too.Assembly was pretty easy, everything fit smoothly.

However, while initially comfortable, the lack of adjustable lumbar support led to back pain issues whenever I worked for longer periods of time.At first, the comfort was undeniable. The seat cushion provides a responsive yet firm padding that maintains its structure well. And the smooth, breathable mesh kept me cool even when working intensely on demanding projects for a couple hours. I appreciated the ample padding on the armrests as well - they provided a welcome spot to rest my elbows.However, right around the 2-3 hour mark of sitting is when the back pain would start to creep up. Without a back component that truly contoured to my spine’s natural S-shape, the chair forced poor posture after prolonged sitting. The integrated lumbar cushion was too thin and small to provide any real lower spinal relief either.While suitable for very short term sitting sessions, I’d hesitate to recommend the Flysky chair for anyone who needs to work from their home desk for multiple focused hours. The complete lack of back height, tilt tension, and lumbar adjustment made it increasingly uncomfortable to maintain neutral postural alignment. Any temporary relief I’d feel from initially sitting would slowly tighten into soreness and nagging lower back pain later on.For anyone seeking out an affordable, stylish chair primarily for temporary use, the Flysky model should meet expectations. But if you require seat support conducive to long work stretches without back discomfort, I suggest considering other ergonomic chairs with more customizable spinal alignment features first. This became increasingly clear each time I stood up from the Flysky chair after an extended sitting session only to be greeted by back tension and stiffness rather than comfort.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 4, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Comfortable Chair!', 'author': 'Barb', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I have been thru a couple of more chairs before I found this one.

Arms are very adjustable in a lot of ways, and has actual quality cushioning. Seat fabric also seems quite nice and less likely to break and fray. Only downside is that it's really not for leaning back at all - when it's in the locked position, you really are pretty straight up.

For about $130-$160 the chair has a lot of great features. The lumbar support is really nice and easy to adjust, the headrest is really good, the recline is easy to use and locks very nicely, the backrest feels really good and has not gotten loose on me, and the arm rests have a lot adjustability. I've known others who use chairs that are around $300-$500 and they say they actually prefer this one over theirs.There are a couple of problems I've had though. The seat can get uncomfortable, so I personally use a thin firm cushion that helps me sit in the chair for hours at a time. The recline on the chair is nice, however the adjustment for the force to sit back in the chair a bit more is quite difficult to use, and is not very intuitive on which direction is for strengthening the force for sitting back more, or lightening the load of it. The arm rests do have a fair bit of adjustability, however they do feel a bit too firm, and can cause some discomfort to my elbows at times. I do think adding a little bit extra padding from factory wouldn't add to the cost of manufacturing the chair very much, and if that is the case I would personally like some more padding in the arm rests.It's quite simple to assemble compared to other chairs I've had, however there are a few DIY fixes I highly recommend when assembling it. First, the cover that goes over where the chair legs and hydraulic lift for raising and lowering the chair meets will rattle a lot when moving the chair. What I did was use the foam from shipping, and cut a shape that will go on the underside of the cover so it does not rattle anymore. Second, after a month or so, I noticed a screw that had fallen off the chair, and the chair would creek a lot. When taking a look I noticed all the screws had backed out a considerable amount, and some were almost about to fall off as well. I ended up redoing all the screws with blue Loctite, and ever since all the screws have been firmly in place on the chair.Overall, even with a few complaints, the chair is definitely pretty good, and is great when factoring in the price. I highly recommend it if you're looking for an office chair in this price point."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 25, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Gambled and I won!

The lumbar support feels nice with the height and depth adjustability. The range of motion for the for the back is great, I lean back a little while working and I lean back all the way when I watch videos or talk with friends online. Putting the chair together was pretty simple, I\'ve done my fair share of assembling chairs in the office ranging from complex to easy as ever, and this one only took about 30 minutes to assemble. The price-tag is pretty reasonable, the chair usually goes for $300, but I got it on sale for only $170, so that was a plus. If I had spent that $300 and noticed the negatives, I would not be a happy camper.Now for the negatives:I would NOT recommend this chair if you are on the heavier side. The ""high density foam,"" is overly dense, making the cushion too firm to sit comfortably for multiple hours. The first day I gave it some time for the foam to compress and get used to having weight on it, but after the 2nd and 3rd day, it was just as bad. My tailbone was hurting after only a couple hours, even with sitting as upright as I can. I had to get a separate seat cushion just so I could sit for over 4 hours on it. The headrest only fits into the back by a ball bearing and is held in my pressure, which means that over time, the headrest will become loose and slip in an out of the sockets that the ball goes into too easily - which it has already done. After leaning my head back on it for just 3 days, it is already wobbly. The seat depth itself is pretty bad, when I\'m all the way on the back of the seat with my back pressed up against the chair, the front edge of the seat only goes to halfway the length of my thighs.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 28, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great Quality , and aesthetic', 'author': 'Dylin', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Was looking for a budget friendly ergo chair for my Office / Game room.

You get to decide if you’re willing to chance going through the headache I did.What I liked: Once assembled it is a great chair as you can see even my cats enjoy it. Shipping was extremely fast. I was able to get this at a great discount so in the end it only cost me around $125. I love the tilt feature, the headrest is nice, and being able to adjust the arms is such a nice feature. Like I said for the price I bought this at it was a steal.What I didn’t like: I’ll start with the issue that I blame the company for. For one I’ve ordered a total of 3 chair. 2 because the first one had many problems (the second one had some minor problems as well) I ordered a third because of course it would go on a very big sale a few days after I bought it and because of the headache I went through I decided I’m saving the money. What were the problems you ask? The first chair I ordered, the tilt feature was messed up and it wouldn’t allow me to tilt (yes I know you can lock this feature that wasn’t the issue). Secondly, I’m guessing this must just be a design flaw but both chair’s backrest had stitching coming undone at the bottom (luckily you can’t see it once assembled and I’m hoping it won’t cause problems down the road). Furthermore both chairs had alignment issues the second one more so than the first. I had to assemble the chair out of order (step 5 before step 4) and this made it way harder to put together. The first chair I did by myself, the second one I caved and asked my partner to help after I accidentally hit the chair lift and the legs smacked me in the forehead. It’s funny now but not so much when it happened. Now I blame the shipping company for the leg cover being cracked and my first chair had something stuck in the arm which made a rattling sound. I’m assuming something got in through the large hole in the corner of the box it was shipped in. Now the second came in great condition so if you have a great delivery person I wouldn’t worry about this too much. Lastly they don’t have a support system. I would have loved to just have received replacement parts, unfortunately you have to get a whole new chair. Because of this you get to go through the fun process of disassembly, trying to fit everything back in the box which was packed so tightly before it’s not an easy process, and then haul the thing to a location that allows you to return it and this thing isn’t light.Final thoughts: I did so much research on this chair before I bought it and now that it’s assembled it was worth it to me. I think that my situation probably isn’t something that will happen to everyone so I say go for it.

Rather uncomfortable unless you purchase a back cushion and a butt cushion separately (which I did). The mesh on the chair digs into your legs if you're wearing shorts, but after the butt cushion, I don't notice it. The back support is a little silly, but again, if you buy a cushion, you'll be fine.What I hate the most about this chair is that the arm rests are in a fixed position and are in no way adjustable; you can't raise or lower the height on them whatsoever. Thankfully, I have a desk that sits pretty high, so I just rest my arms on the desk when I work. But I could see this feature being extremely annoying to someone who doesn't have the kind of desk I have. I also find myself leaning back and going to rest my arms on where the arm rest should be, only to nearly fall out of my chair because the arm rest sits so low (almost on the same level as the cushion). Why in the world would a company design a chair with arm rests so low? Or with arm rests you can't adjust? Ugh. At least it reclines/goes back a little when you lean back.Assembly was pretty easy. They give you instructions and all your screws and an allen wrench. In total, it took me about 20 minutes to put this thing together by myself, and considering I'm not exactly handy or used to putting things together, that's not bad.I guess it beats sitting on the hard wooden 80's style kitchen chair that I was using before.

The bottom (metal) comes together very easily, and it took me about ten minutes for all of it, if that. The top and seat of the chair are then held together by only the arms of the chair, by four screws, two on each side (I am not optimistic about the durability of these four screws holding a back on a chair as someone moves around and puts their weight against it to begin with. The next problem is that the four holes that attach the arms and thus hold the entire upper chair together are very poorly drilled. I tried putting the screws in the holes with the hand tool they provide and a drill, and they don\'t want to go in. I tried just putting the screw in the hole to see if I was getting a bad angle, but they really don\'t want to go in the hole without the arm between it. They seem to have been generally drilled very haphazardly, and if you don\'t get the exact angle, it doesn\'t go in. If you do get the right angle, and the pieces shift (which they almost always will, especially if you\'re working by yourself, as you are holding together two weighty pieces that are secured in no way, until those screws get started, then you won\'t be able to get the screw in; and you\'ll have to pull it back and find the passage again. On top of that, because the screw holes are drilled how they are, it is very easy, much easier than getting it in the socket, to get the screw to go off at an angle and just screw into the padding of the chair. I have been working on this upper for over two hours, and I\'ve gotten one screw in (loosely, so I can still move the pieces); and I\'m frankly beginning to worry that the pressure of wrestling with the chair over and over to get in the other three (or just the next one) is going to end up snapping it off on the socket.The chair shows it being able to recline and adjust a few inches, but I really see nothing on the chair that could possibly make this possible (unless their photographing the slow progress of the chair back breaking off, because it\'s only held by four screws that don\'t want to find the socket with a map and a local guide). This chair will most likely be renamed by me to be ""That time I paid $50 to take something to the trash room"", because without paying someone to do it, I don\'t think I will ever be able to get it together.I watched the video. It doesn\'t work. I read the reviews that said it was easy to put together, and their suggestions didn\'t work (and I\'m wondering if they were paid now). I would return it, but after having worked in an office for years and having put together numerous desk chairs, I was sure it would be no issue and threw out the box and shipping materials. I guess, it is mine now. My millstone.To grant the star I gave it, if the pieces went together, which they don\'t, it would be a nice looking chair. It would be roomy. The padding seems comfortable.

I love working from home, but I have struggled to get an office set-up that is comfortable for the long hours I now spend at one desk (average of 50 hours per week for my employer and another 20 or so for my own writing). I solved most of the problems, except the chair. I\'ve tried several from the big box office supply store, but they were big and bulky and the arms interfered with my desk setup -- forcing me to sit too far back. Then I tried a couple of chairs sold by home furniture stores (because they didn\'t have arms) but they each caused a lot of aches and pains because they weren\'t really ergonomic, or meant to be used for such long hours.I was hesitant to buy something online, but I\'m glad I found this one. I don\'t write many reviews, but I really recommend this chair highly.The biggest feature for me was the ability to move the arms up or down, and work from the chair in either position -- because I move between a corner desk (where I don\'t want to use arms, for the most ergonomic position) and a laptop desk behind me (where I DO want to use arms for the most ergonomic position). This design factor primary helps to save space when the chair isn\'t in use -- but it allows me to use the same chair comfortably for both my corner desk and my laptop desk.I am using the chair on a hardwood surface, and the casters work perfectly there. I was worried it would be too slippy (a problem with the first office chair I tried), but they are perfect: easy to roll when I want to roll but immobile otherwise.The quality of the construction seems very high to me, and the chair was very easy to assemble. The pieces were carefully packed, the instructions were OK (the photo illustrations are too small to give enough detail, but the design is very intuitive so that wasn\'t a problem), the company provides an email address for support (which I didn\'t need to use, but which I appreciate having when assembly is required). The casters seem like they will be the first place the chair begins to show wear and tear. All the other parts of the chair seem like they will be sturdy and long lasting.It feels both comfortable and solid to sit in, and so far the back/hip/neck pain I was experiencing in the evenings with my old home-decor chair have resolved.I purchased the white model, which looks a little more ""homey"" than the all black, more corporate looking chair. I am very, very pleased with this purchase. I am actually tempted to buy a second one just to have in reserve, in case anything happens to this one!

I purchased the chair on sale but even at $149 current price tag I believe the chair is worth the price. Well constructed easy to assemble and for the most part has held up for over a year and a half of use. The chair is also largely comfortable although I have added a seat cushion as the seat bottom is very firm.The bad. Some of the plugs to cover the screw and bolt holes don’t fit well and a poorly made I wound up having to glue a few of them in place. The biggest problem I have with the chair is that it rocks From the front right corner to the rear left corner. Although it is designed to rock back-and-forth to allow you to recline some, this is an a forward and backward reclining motion but one more the chair is loose enough due to the construction that the seat will pivot between those two corners. This is due in part to the left handle also serving as the pin to lock the chair in place to keep it from reclining or rocking. To make matters worse when it rocks from corner to corner the chair pops midway through and recently a piece broke somewhere in that assembly. The chair still functions and is still very sturdy but I am going to have to break down and buy a better chair.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 30, 2021', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars perfect desk chair', 'author': 'westshore', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Comfortable, movable arms, easy height adjustment, love the color, and best of all not too hard to assemble.

It\'s just pretty. As pretty in person as it is in the photo. Tips back fairly well (once you figure out how to use the lever appropriately). Good size for shorter to low-average-height women. Wouldn\'t work as well for average-to-tall women and definitely wouldn\'t be as comfy for a tall man. Slips under an average height desk very easily even with the arms down. Arms come up nicely if needed, but I find they\'re actually at a good heigh for me and don\'t often put them up. Seat is a little smaller than I thought since I usually like to cross my legs in a chair, although it can still be done. If that were it, I\'d really be very happy with the chair and probably give it 4 or even 5 stars.Unfortunately, there are 3 major drawbacks that have been a big disappointment (even after just 3 months\' use):1) it seems comfy when you first sit down but it doesn\'t stay comfortable over time. I study for hours at a time and after a couple hours my butt is hurting and I need to switch chairs. My husband\'s chair (only a little more expensive than this one) stays comfortable allllll day long and I would have gotten his if it went with my decor... (I know, vanity definitely won here and I kind of regret it...).2) it makes these loud disconcerting clunking noises even with regular use. Like, I swivel a little to the side and ""CLUNK!"" We made sure everything was tighened and affixed appropriately but... it still happens. Definitely annoying and makes me feel like the chair is about to give out... even though it generally seems quite sturdy.3) sometimes it feels lopsided (?!). I find that if I swivel it around about 90-180 degrees it\'s better, but if I swivel it back it\'s lopsided again. Haven\'t figured out what that\'s about but it\'s really uncomfortable and annoying.Overall... if you plan to use it occasionally or even 1-2 hours a day and want something cute and low profile, go for this. If you study a LOT or work from home all day... this chair will sorely disappoint you (and if you\'re like me, you\'ll wind up stealing your husband\'s chair sometimes...)', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 10, 2021', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great chair for the price - easy to assemble - perfect for short folks', 'author': 'FJ', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I rarely write reviews but I wanted to do so in this case because my experience, having two of them, contradicted many of the reviews I read. Both chairs, purchased several years apart, were easy to assemble. It\'s fairly intuitive. I would just say make sure you know which part of the seat is the front and which is the back, when you put on the arms and back of the chair. The bottom of the chair is labeled so that you will know which is which, B/F. I have seen pictures in the reviews where the back was not put on correctly limiting the seat size.I had no problem either time installing the wheels. They are installed like any wheels you might add to a rolling cart or Rubbermaid storage drawers. This time I upgraded the wheels to ""Office Chair Wheels Replacement,(Set of 5) 3\'\' Rollerblade Wheels Smooth Rolling Heavy Duty Casters Safe for All Floors Including Hardwood - Universal Stem 7/16 Inch, White"" by LPHY so that I could have all white wheels. No problem. I can confirm that 11mm wheels worked for me. Based on reviews I purchased both 10mm (which I couldn\'t get in white) and 11mm. I returned the 10mm. They were way too small. Beware that using rollerblade wheels will raise the height of the chair approx another inch. So if you are short like me and need a very low chair, I would advise against making that change. My feet still touch the floor with the replacement wheels on. I\'m 5\' 2"". I use the chair on a hardwood and find there is a slight disadvantage to the rollerblade wheels - sometimes the chair starts to drift. It\'s not a big deal for me and I think it\'s worth it for the all white look. I doubt it would happen if I were using the chair on a carpet.If you are short, like to the point where co-workers get a but of a fright when they sit in the chair you previously used in the conference, I think you will be very happy with this chair. Looking at other chairs, I think this chair has the lowest starting height when using the wheels that come with it.The chair does rock back, although not much. Normal position is 90 degrees. I think it goes back to 120. Works for me. You can only lock it at 90 degrees. If the chair won\'t go back, pull out the level on the right side. Push it back in to lock at 90 degrees.The one problem I had with the original chair, which was black and white, was that eventually the gas lift, the thing that makes it go up and down, started to sink. I contacted the company and sent me a replacement that I received quickly. It toook me forever to get around to replacing it and when I did I didn\'t have the right tools and made the mistake of using a hammer to get the wheel base off first. I was then unable to get remove the original lift out of the chair base. Lesson learned. But I had always had my eye on the beige chair, which wasn\'t available when I made my first purchase, because it better matched my office color scheme. So I gave up on trying to replace the lift and treated myself to a new chair in the color I wanted and with all white wheels!I will just add that if you need a lot of lumbar support, this chair might not work for you. The support is just the mesh on the back of the chair. That works for me. You might need a lumbar pillow or a different chair.I also haven\'t had trouble with the cushion and I am carrying more weight that I should be, to put it mildly. Once I got the wheels off the original chair I couldn\'t use it so I had to revert to my previous office chair while waiting for the new one to come. It only took a couple of days but it make me realize how comfortable the design of this chair was for me. The seat of that chair curved up on the sides and I was uncomfortable after seating in it for any length of time. With this chair the seat is wide enough so that there is extra cushion on each side of my butt but more importanly I can sit with my legs slightly out to the side without any impediment, which is how I tend to site.I\'ve seen pictures of damanged chairs in the reviews and wondered what the hell are these people doing in these chairs. Granted I don\'t use mine all day, except during the pandemic, and I don\'t have any kids at home.

It’s extremely comfy and I can sit for long periods of time without any back pain. It’s easy to move around despite having no wheels. I have a plastic chair mat under my desk and it slides across it easily when I need to move it out of the way. I love the height of this chair as well. I am 4’11 and most chairs even at their lowest setting my feet don’t fully reach the floor comfortably. Usually my legs are leaned forward or on my toes a bit. However this chair at its lowest setting I can perfectly reach the floor and knees are at the comfiest 90 degree angle.SETUP: The chair was fairly easy to put together. Thankfully I read the reviews or I would’ve been extremely frustrated. The instructions for this are literally 4 steps that make it seem super easy. It is but not because of the instructions. Another reviewer left a video review and said it’s easier to put together if you swap steps 4 and 3 so you can line up the holes on the back with the bottom easier. This is 100% true so thanks for that reviewer!!! I’ll add on - you have to put the back and bottom together at kind of a weird angle to get the holes to line up and start with the back holes first! I can’t even really describe the angle but it feels really wrong. Almost like a wider angle than you think it should ever go. The back of the chair isn’t a 90 degree angle it tilts back a bit. If you can find the angle you’ll get the screws in with very little issue. I put this together by myself in about 5 minutes and 4 of those minutes were figuring out the angle for the back of the chair.CONS: I only have one con really. It’s the angle of the back of the chair. It’s tilted back just a tad too much for me. I like to be able to sit back in my chair and lean into the back but with this one if I do that I can’t type very well. I think if I add a lumbar support pillow I can lean back comfortably.

I don't care about the lack of wheels since my office area is stuck with carpet.That said, for a 4-step assembly, it was absolutely an annoying 4-step assembly. Here's what I ended up doing to put this chair together:1: remove packaging from everything, locate page of instructions.2: follow instructions as-is to put the base on; realize that the backrest section isn't lining up nicely. Remove base section. Look at prior reviews for advice.3: Struggle for a good 7 minutes or so to find the Perfect Angle to get the backrest section on. Ended up dry-fitting the front-facing two screws before managing to get the back-facing two in; screw in the back-facing two as far as possible, then remove the front-facing screws in order to get the base section wedged in underneath as per instructions.4: finally get all the screws dry-fitted and partially screwed in, so I can tighten everything up and actually use the chair.As a final note, I'm a bit disappointed that this chair uses a gas cylinder instead of something mechanical. The gas always eventually leaks out, leaving the chair to slowly deflate.

It's definitely designed for 2 people to make it a bit easier, as I had to wrap my hand around both the back rest and the bottom to squeeze the two together to get the bolts in. Two bolts felt like they had stripped, but upon further twisting, they eventually locked into their final position (I'm guessing this is where some of the complaints about stripping come from, they just didn't twist far enough in...it's really surprising how deep the actual bolts go in, and how many turns it takes to finally settle them in).I will say the instructions were on a similar level to what La-Z-Boy provides, which is a nice touch. Easy to read, lots of solid details. They also came with a fair amount of extra parts, and the quality of the parts seemed decent. My only gripe is the plastic nubs to fit into the holes where the bolts go in, are not properly fitted, and most pop out on their own. It was very difficult to get them into place for the lower two sockets, and in attempting to force them into the upper holes where the moving armrest is ended up forcing me to use a small hammer, and I still couldn't get them to fit properly. Even swapping them out. I stopped trying as I ended up nicking the exterior slightly and did not feel like doing any extra exterior damage in a vain attempt. That said, they aren't really necessary. It looks fine with the holes around the movable armrest and the two bolts into the seat sealed off.The build quality is fairly decent. The exception seems to be the seat area. The sides and back of the seat have ample and adequate cushion and foam. However the center has almost nothing. I suppose this was a way to cut corners, and most large sized individuals tend to be thicker on the edges of their bums, rather than have more weight around the center, and most people will sit further back into the chair (were again, there is adequate cushioning). However once I move a little further into the center, as I tend to sit forward, that center cushion deflates really fast, and it's like sitting on a rock.The back support took some time to get used to. It's very thick foam in the lower back region, and it leans a bit backwards for what I'm used to (most of the chairs I buy are more straight backed). So it took a little time to get used to. It's not bad, but feels a bit off. I'm guessing this is designed to alleviate lower back pain, though it's a bit much, and pushes me forward, where when I lean forward into the seat, and given the angle of the seat's rear cushion, really pushes me into that center with limited cushioning. So I have to be very mindful of how I sit in this chair.I haven't had it long, so I'm not sure how well the foam will hold up. I had to replace a rather nice faux leather high back, but metal frame chair where the joint where the arm bolt is connected into the back is where some corners were cut (it's the width of the bolt itself, and of a lower grade material, not steel, so it broke with just a slight force application). This chair seems to be a bit more durable. However, it's plastic, with the only metal being the bolts and the screw holds meant to hold the thing together. So I'm not positive on longevity.The company that makes this chair is American, but its made in China. Though the quality is decent, and the thickness of the faux leather seems fairly solid, and difficult to rip or tear, though I'm not about to take a knife to it to properly test but some tugging and pulling indicates it will last awhile, even in dry weather.The rating itself is based on the price to quality.

It provides adequate support for my lower back, which is a must for someone like me who spends hours working on a computer.Everything Is Adjustable: What I love most about this chair is its adjustability. You can customize it to suit your preferences. The adjustable lumbar support is fantastic; it allows me to find the perfect level of support for my lower back. The chair's height is also easily adjustable, and you can recline it to different angles. This adaptability has really helped reduce any discomfort during extended work sessions.Metal Base: The metal base is sturdy and well-constructed. I feel secure and stable while sitting in this chair, even when leaning back. It's a nice touch that adds to the chair's overall durability.Cons:The Armrests: Unfortunately, the armrests are a bit of a letdown. They feel somewhat hard and uncomfortable when you rest your arms on them for an extended period. It would be great if they were better padded or could be adjusted more comfortably.Despite the armrests' minor downside, I must say that the Marsail Office Chair Ergonomic Desk Chair has improved my work-from-home experience.

I’m 5’3” and found the adjustable chair height good, but I believe my desk is too tall for proper ergonomics and I have to use a cushion to sit higher. I probably need to look for a new desk!! The back support is good if you sit all the way back but I tend to sit closer to front edge of chair to reach the keyboard as I am doing virtual meetings all day and typing on keyboard during most of my meetings. The support length under thigh is good although I wish the front end could be tilted up a little as it feels like it is sloping down a little and it might be due to not enough cushioning in front. The arm support is at good height for ergonomics but I tend not to use the arm rests as the height of my desk and level of arm rests don’t allow me to scoot chair in close enough due to my desk style. I do love being able to fold the arms up for storage when I’m not using it to make more space. I’m not sure if the chair is supposed to rock back or lean back but it took a lot of effort for me to make it lean back. My 6’ tall husband sat in chair and says it was comfortable and he was able to rock the chair back and forth with no effort.Price was decent- I purchased during Black Friday sale.Easy to assemble, all parts included, no additional tools needed.

At first, I was very happy with it, especially for the price. However, in less than 6 months it started feeling like sitting on a solid board. The rest of the chair is still nice, the back mesh is comfortable (I removed the supposed lumbar support because those never work for me anyway) and seems to fit my back just right, the arms are nothing special, but they\'re fine for my use and I mostly wanted them to flip up. But my back can\'t take sitting on a solid board, as I do working from home. Maybe that\'s what you get at this price point, and that\'s just that, I don\'t know. Maybe for more infrequent use and/or lighter people this is a fine chair and I\'m asking too much of it (if you believe what you read on the internet, you need to spend 10x as much for a top office chair).I note that the description says: After 100,000 experiments, the seat surface is durable for 10 years... And: Designed with a sturdy nylon base, this adjustable computer chair can support up to 300 lbs during 8 hours of continuous use. So, take that for what it\'s worth. ""The seat surface""? Can support 300 lbs? Well, I guess. It hasn\'t broken, the seat covering seems fine. But, a 2x4 might also meet that description. I don\'t know if these claims are meant to apply to the seat cushion, but I have not found the cushion part of the seat to meet those claims.I wish I could be more positive about this chair because I really like it other than the seat being so hard, so fast. I\'d like to emphasize that I don\'t think this is a problem unique to this office chair, especially at this price. Just understand what you\'re paying and what you\'re getting. Maybe for a different use case than mine this is a good option. At any rate, that\'s the reason for my rating, I hoped I could use it more than half a year. I\'m 5\'7"" 185 lbs.Update: I received a nice message from the Seller in response to my review, saying they want to help me with my experience and that it is possible to ""purchase a cushion to improve your experience."" I thought I should add that here, in case anyone else has the same experience and wants to try that.I would also like to add that I hope my review was clear. I did not mean to imply that I think the chair is defective or is a uniquely bad chair. It may be a fine chair for a different use case and I just wanted people to know that and temper expectations accordingly. Was my original two stars too harsh? I don\'t know, I guess that\'s for an individual to decide. Again, I used this chair working from home, 8 hours a day, plus personal use. I know it\'s common to eventually sink through seats of office chairs. Maybe if you use it less, maybe if you don\'t mind that feeling sinking throught the cushion and/or it doesn\'t bother your back, maybe it\'s a great chair. I did hope the chair would be useful to me for longer than 6 months, though, but I\'m raising the rating to three stars since the Seller reached out with an attempted solution. I appreciate the customer service. Personally, I\'ve moved on to a full mesh chair, hoping a mesh seat works better/longer for me. For what it\'s worth, had I written a review shortly after getting the chair, I may have also said 5 stars, great chair. I did think so.

The smooth-rolling casters make it easy to move around, and the 360-degree swivel allows for quick reactions in intense gaming moments.The racing-style design of the chair is a visual treat. The blue color is vibrant, and the sleek lines give it a sporty look that complements my gaming setup. It's not just functional; it's a statement piece in my gaming room.Assembly was relatively straightforward, thanks to clear instructions, and all the necessary tools were provided. I had the chair set up in no time.While the BestOffice Gaming Chair is primarily designed for gamers, it's also an excellent choice for anyone looking for a comfortable and stylish office chair. It's versatile, well-constructed, and the reclining feature makes it ideal for short breaks and relaxation during the workday.In conclusion, the BestOffice Gaming Chair with Footrest has exceeded my expectations. It combines ergonomic support, gaming-specific features, and a stylish design into one impressive package. Whether you're a dedicated gamer or in need of a comfortable office chair, this gaming chair is a top-tier choice. It's a throne that not only enhances your gaming experience but also complements your gaming room's aesthetics."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 14, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing quality or an outstanding price!', 'author': 'jennifer', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Bought for 12. Yr old birthday present. He has never been happier. He loves the. footstool, but, I do not think that part is very comfortable. I’m 5’7” and to me, it just feels awkward the way it fits my legs but, that’s not to say I don’t use it when sitting in this chair. It is better than no stool, I just think it could be made to fit and be formed to legs lengths better. I want one to support my feet to. BUT, it’s a GREAT chair. 7 months later and many, many active, crazy, and excited 12 yr old boys not only gaming in it but a few occasions of it being used to sleep in for the night, and it still works, sits and looks brand new! I was a little leary on the quality and how long it would hold up for due to the price when comparing to similar chairs and most where $150 & up. But it’s been great. And if it was going to fall apart or tear up because of it being cheap quality (which. It obviously is not) believe me, my son, whom we refer to as “The Destroying Monkey” (why we call him this-he doesn’t walk, it’s always jumping to smack ceilings and doorways, darts in and out, flips or flops on everything, yanks and tosses, the 1 to test ALL buttons, knobs, dials and all that moves, AND assembles and unassembles everything to see what’s inside, including the Thermostat on the wall @ 2. He can tear up even proven indestructible things, if you get the picture). He would have made it fall into pieces by now. He truly puts anything he sees, plays with, or sits on To the test of its quality and it’s limitations by throwing, tossing, using it for everything it was not intended for, flopping or laying sideways and upside down in or on it, and just being an overly curious, creative, imaginative wiggle worm and 12 yr old country boy. This is a chair I highly recommend i if you are looking for a good quality chair for a very reasonable price.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States November 12, 2019', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '3.0 out of 5 stars High quality gaming chair', 'author': 'Izaiah fields', 'rating': 3, 'content': 'This is one of the more expensive ""gaming chairs"", not the most expensive, but you can find some for about half the price. If you get it on sale, I would recommend it. Overall it is a very comfortable chair to sit in for a few hours of gaming. The reason I didn\'t give it 5 stars is that there are some areas with room for improvement: I like the footrest idea, but unless you are shorter than 5\'6"", it really is not a great design. I am 6\' tall, and the footrest ends up at about mid-calf range, which is not the most comfortable, I still end up needing something to rest my feet on. The armrests could be a little wider, with a little more cushion, maybe a little more ergonomically designed for the gamer, especially if you\'re gaming with a controller. I do however like the idea of the hinge aspect of the armrests, so they move back with you when you recline. Another thing I noticed (mostly due to my height again), is the neck/head pillow height. I find when I am sitting in the chair, that pillow actually ends up at my shoulders, and I can adjust it to where I need it, but as soon as I move it falls back to it\'s normal resting place, and I have to readjust every time I sit back down, so a nice improvement would be to see multiple slots for mounting that to accommodate a wider range of gamers more comfortably. The vibrating lumbar support cushion is a nice touch, it can help a little bit if you\'re getting some tension in your lower back, but it produces quite a loud buzzing sound, so often I don\'t use it, because it\'s just too distracting. The seat cushion is my favorite part of the chair, it\'s actually very nice and easy to sit on for long periods. The seat always tends to be the problem part of a chair for me, it\'s hard to find one comfortable for me to spend any time in without soreness. The long flat cushion spreads out your weight nicely, so there are no pressure points like your tailbone or in your thighs that end up hurting due to excessive pressure on that area. So, all in all, it\'s a decent mid range gaming chair, room for improvement definitely, particularly if you\'re an above average height gamer, but mostly a good solid chair, that is worth the money if you can get it for less than full price.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 12, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Falling apart in less then a year.', 'author': 'Amazon Customer', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'My son hasn’t even had this chair a year and it’s falling apart.

My feet do not touch the ground so its not short (my feet hang about an inch above the ground), but the structure feels somewhat small compared to another gamer chair I had before. Sitting fully upright and butt all the way back, I still have an inch of space before the seat touches the back of my calves, so the seat isn\'t that big too. Now what I do feel too wide is the arm rests, it would be nice if I could move them in more, and if I could adjust them down or up. It\'s tad bit too wide. When the footrest is inside the chair, it\'s upside down and the plastic is a little sharp, so may cut the back of your calves. The lower back-pad with vibrator is nice if using it for vibrator, but its a bit thick if not using it for vibrator, it may get annoying later. Also, the arm rests, underneath them is pretty sharp too.So basically, back-piece is a little short, seat is a little short, armrests are little wide and not adjustable, back-pad is a bit thick, and underneath the arm rests and foot rest is a bit sharp.Its not too bad, but not too good either. It was easy to install, and the wheels are tough to get in, they bit different than other wheels I seen. It is somewhat comfy seat, the back-pad with vibrator is a bit too thick though.This chair is one of the cheaper ones, but still expensive, around $100, so kind of disappointed and kind of expected. It\'s cheaper against the other chairs of its kind, but its not really cheap when you just think about the price.I\'ll probably spend $50 more and get a better chair next time. This chair is cheap compared to others like it, but its still expensive. This chair lacks customization of the features, and could work on smoothing out sharp areas of the chair that I think would make it better and probably 4/5 stars.Also, I think I\'d go with one without vibrator next time too, its nice but its very sturdy and thick, I miss regular cushion. I normally sit with legs somewhat spread apart, and its a bit uncomfortable with these side pieces towards the end of the seat. They a bit too tall and sturdy. It\'s not a bad chair, but could be a lot better. So I give this chair a 3/5.I changed my mind to 1/5, its just not comfortable anymore, the sides on the seat irritate my thighs. I wanted to see the padding, which is good but I noticed they removed all the zipper hangings probably because so many people checking and finding things wrong, so they removed all of them to make it difficult to check. The arm rest is sharp as well as the foot rest when its docked underneath the chair, the back of my calves brush against it. The massage pad I would go without one, its just too stiff and I hardly use it. It pushes you too far in the seat because too thick and I don\'t get to enjoy the headrest due to how thick the massage pad is. Sitting indian style in the chair is uncomfortable too, its just not wide enough and/or the side piece is too tall and sturdy, needs to be bent outwards more and not so pointy.Pictures are showing the sharp plastic underneath the arm rest and an arm can fit in between which is bad due to sharp plastic, the sharp plastic on the footrest, and zipper without zipper grips (they must have ripped them off, due to people inspecting the padding).I just got the chair 13 July, 2020, and already want to return it.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States July 13, 2020', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Arrived Dirty but Beautiful Chair', 'author': 'MysticShan', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'I bought this chair because I needed a new office chair for my apartment.

The packaging was sturdy, reassuring me of its safe transit, yet it had a no-frills approach that suggested practicality over extravagance.The chair's premium PU leather stood out immediately. It promised durability and an easy-to-clean surface, a must for any office environment. The touch was indeed smooth, and the chair's overall design felt modern, with its double layer padding adding a touch of elegance.Adjustability is a key feature here; the 10cm height range and 120° rocking function allow for a good deal of personalization. The foldable armrests at 90° are a thoughtful addition, especially for those working in tight spaces.From a user-friendly perspective, the chair was straightforward to assemble, thanks to clear instructions. The built-in lumbar support and ergonomic design were immediately noticeable, providing comfort during prolonged periods of sitting.Performance-wise, the chair lives up to its ergonomic claims, supporting a healthy posture, which is essential for long work hours. The maximum capacity of 250lbs is also a testament to its sturdy build.When compared to other chairs in its category, this Brick Attic chair holds its own in terms of functionality and design. However, the actual user experience may vary depending on personal preferences for cushion firmness and back support.In terms of value for money, this chair seems to strike a balance between quality and cost, making it an attractive option for those seeking a blend of style, comfort, and durability without breaking the bank.The top positive aspects include its sleek design, user-friendly adjustments, and the quality of the PU leather. Nonetheless, potential improvements could be in providing more recline angles and perhaps enhancing the armrest padding for additional comfort.In summary, this chair is well-suited for anyone looking for a reliable office chair that supports good posture, offers adjustability, and has a modern aesthetic.

Took maybe 20 minutes from unboxing to it being ready to use.The back of the chair is a little further back than I'm used to; while I was initially concerned about this it actually is a big plus since it encourages me to maintain a good posture as I'm working but also is comfortable when I went to lean back for a bit. Lastly we have a white cat so I had some mild concerns about my chair turning white, but several weeks in there's barely any hair on it, which is amazing considering how every other piece of furniture has that happen.Overall, extremely satisfied with this purchase several weeks in. The wide stable base provides opportunity to use plenty of different sitting positions for anyone like me that is fidgety. Compared to my old chair which left me feeling stiff after a day of working in it, I feel great at the end of the day.

For about $130-$160 the chair has a lot of great features. The lumbar support is really nice and easy to adjust, the headrest is really good, the recline is easy to use and locks very nicely, the backrest feels really good and has not gotten loose on me, and the arm rests have a lot adjustability. I've known others who use chairs that are around $300-$500 and they say they actually prefer this one over theirs.There are a couple of problems I've had though. The seat can get uncomfortable, so I personally use a thin firm cushion that helps me sit in the chair for hours at a time. The recline on the chair is nice, however the adjustment for the force to sit back in the chair a bit more is quite difficult to use, and is not very intuitive on which direction is for strengthening the force for sitting back more, or lightening the load of it. The arm rests do have a fair bit of adjustability, however they do feel a bit too firm, and can cause some discomfort to my elbows at times. I do think adding a little bit extra padding from factory wouldn't add to the cost of manufacturing the chair very much, and if that is the case I would personally like some more padding in the arm rests.It's quite simple to assemble compared to other chairs I've had, however there are a few DIY fixes I highly recommend when assembling it. First, the cover that goes over where the chair legs and hydraulic lift for raising and lowering the chair meets will rattle a lot when moving the chair. What I did was use the foam from shipping, and cut a shape that will go on the underside of the cover so it does not rattle anymore. Second, after a month or so, I noticed a screw that had fallen off the chair, and the chair would creek a lot. When taking a look I noticed all the screws had backed out a considerable amount, and some were almost about to fall off as well. I ended up redoing all the screws with blue Loctite, and ever since all the screws have been firmly in place on the chair.Overall, even with a few complaints, the chair is definitely pretty good, and is great when factoring in the price.

It’s perfectly fine.-Arm cushions are perfectly workable and comfortable.-Cushion is also fine, but can’t testify to long term use.At this price, I think it’s a steal. Putting it together is dead simple- it’s just a lot of the same type of screw. I did it by myself. It also seems like it will last, and doesn’t creak.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 7, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '2.0 out of 5 stars Uncomfortable seat', 'author': 'Robert Garrett', 'rating': 2, 'content': 'I\'ll start with the positives:The ergonomic back feels great, the mesh is firm enough where it doesn\'t sag too much when you lean back, but springy enough to form to your back. The lumbar support feels nice with the height and depth adjustability. The range of motion for the for the back is great, I lean back a little while working and I lean back all the way when I watch videos or talk with friends online. Putting the chair together was pretty simple, I\'ve done my fair share of assembling chairs in the office ranging from complex to easy as ever, and this one only took about 30 minutes to assemble. The price-tag is pretty reasonable, the chair usually goes for $300, but I got it on sale for only $170, so that was a plus. If I had spent that $300 and noticed the negatives, I would not be a happy camper.Now for the negatives:I would NOT recommend this chair if you are on the heavier side. The ""high density foam,"" is overly dense, making the cushion too firm to sit comfortably for multiple hours. The first day I gave it some time for the foam to compress and get used to having weight on it, but after the 2nd and 3rd day, it was just as bad. My tailbone was hurting after only a couple hours, even with sitting as upright as I can. I had to get a separate seat cushion just so I could sit for over 4 hours on it. The headrest only fits into the back by a ball bearing and is held in my pressure, which means that over time, the headrest will become loose and slip in an out of the sockets that the ball goes into too easily - which it has already done. After leaning my head back on it for just 3 days, it is already wobbly. The seat depth itself is pretty bad, when I\'m all the way on the back of the seat with my back pressed up against the chair, the front edge of the seat only goes to halfway the length of my thighs.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 28, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great Quality , and aesthetic', 'author': 'Dylin', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Was looking for a budget friendly ergo chair for my Office / Game room.

You get to decide if you’re willing to chance going through the headache I did.What I liked: Once assembled it is a great chair as you can see even my cats enjoy it. Shipping was extremely fast. I was able to get this at a great discount so in the end it only cost me around $125. I love the tilt feature, the headrest is nice, and being able to adjust the arms is such a nice feature. Like I said for the price I bought this at it was a steal.What I didn’t like: I’ll start with the issue that I blame the company for. For one I’ve ordered a total of 3 chair. 2 because the first one had many problems (the second one had some minor problems as well) I ordered a third because of course it would go on a very big sale a few days after I bought it and because of the headache I went through I decided I’m saving the money. What were the problems you ask? The first chair I ordered, the tilt feature was messed up and it wouldn’t allow me to tilt (yes I know you can lock this feature that wasn’t the issue). Secondly, I’m guessing this must just be a design flaw but both chair’s backrest had stitching coming undone at the bottom (luckily you can’t see it once assembled and I’m hoping it won’t cause problems down the road). Furthermore both chairs had alignment issues the second one more so than the first. I had to assemble the chair out of order (step 5 before step 4) and this made it way harder to put together. The first chair I did by myself, the second one I caved and asked my partner to help after I accidentally hit the chair lift and the legs smacked me in the forehead. It’s funny now but not so much when it happened. Now I blame the shipping company for the leg cover being cracked and my first chair had something stuck in the arm which made a rattling sound. I’m assuming something got in through the large hole in the corner of the box it was shipped in. Now the second came in great condition so if you have a great delivery person I wouldn’t worry about this too much. Lastly they don’t have a support system. I would have loved to just have received replacement parts, unfortunately you have to get a whole new chair. Because of this you get to go through the fun process of disassembly, trying to fit everything back in the box which was packed so tightly before it’s not an easy process, and then haul the thing to a location that allows you to return it and this thing isn’t light.Final thoughts: I did so much research on this chair before I bought it and now that it’s assembled it was worth it to me. I think that my situation probably isn’t something that will happen to everyone so I say go for it.

The bottom (metal) comes together very easily, and it took me about ten minutes for all of it, if that. The top and seat of the chair are then held together by only the arms of the chair, by four screws, two on each side (I am not optimistic about the durability of these four screws holding a back on a chair as someone moves around and puts their weight against it to begin with. The next problem is that the four holes that attach the arms and thus hold the entire upper chair together are very poorly drilled. I tried putting the screws in the holes with the hand tool they provide and a drill, and they don\'t want to go in. I tried just putting the screw in the hole to see if I was getting a bad angle, but they really don\'t want to go in the hole without the arm between it. They seem to have been generally drilled very haphazardly, and if you don\'t get the exact angle, it doesn\'t go in. If you do get the right angle, and the pieces shift (which they almost always will, especially if you\'re working by yourself, as you are holding together two weighty pieces that are secured in no way, until those screws get started, then you won\'t be able to get the screw in; and you\'ll have to pull it back and find the passage again. On top of that, because the screw holes are drilled how they are, it is very easy, much easier than getting it in the socket, to get the screw to go off at an angle and just screw into the padding of the chair. I have been working on this upper for over two hours, and I\'ve gotten one screw in (loosely, so I can still move the pieces); and I\'m frankly beginning to worry that the pressure of wrestling with the chair over and over to get in the other three (or just the next one) is going to end up snapping it off on the socket.The chair shows it being able to recline and adjust a few inches, but I really see nothing on the chair that could possibly make this possible (unless their photographing the slow progress of the chair back breaking off, because it\'s only held by four screws that don\'t want to find the socket with a map and a local guide).

Yr old birthday present. He has never been happier. He loves the. footstool, but, I do not think that part is very comfortable. I’m 5’7” and to me, it just feels awkward the way it fits my legs but, that’s not to say I don’t use it when sitting in this chair. It is better than no stool, I just think it could be made to fit and be formed to legs lengths better. I want one to support my feet to. BUT, it’s a GREAT chair. 7 months later and many, many active, crazy, and excited 12 yr old boys not only gaming in it but a few occasions of it being used to sleep in for the night, and it still works, sits and looks brand new! I was a little leary on the quality and how long it would hold up for due to the price when comparing to similar chairs and most where $150 & up. But it’s been great. And if it was going to fall apart or tear up because of it being cheap quality (which. It obviously is not) believe me, my son, whom we refer to as “The Destroying Monkey” (why we call him this-he doesn’t walk, it’s always jumping to smack ceilings and doorways, darts in and out, flips or flops on everything, yanks and tosses, the 1 to test ALL buttons, knobs, dials and all that moves, AND assembles and unassembles everything to see what’s inside, including the Thermostat on the wall @ 2. He can tear up even proven indestructible things, if you get the picture). He would have made it fall into pieces by now. He truly puts anything he sees, plays with, or sits on To the test of its quality and it’s limitations by throwing, tossing, using it for everything it was not intended for, flopping or laying sideways and upside down in or on it, and just being an overly curious, creative, imaginative wiggle worm and 12 yr old country boy. This is a chair I highly recommend i if you are looking for a good quality chair for a very reasonable price.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States November 12, 2019', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '3.0 out of 5 stars High quality gaming chair', 'author': 'Izaiah fields', 'rating': 3, 'content': 'This is one of the more expensive ""gaming chairs"", not the most expensive, but you can find some for about half the price. If you get it on sale, I would recommend it. Overall it is a very comfortable chair to sit in for a few hours of gaming. The reason I didn\'t give it 5 stars is that there are some areas with room for improvement: I like the footrest idea, but unless you are shorter than 5\'6"", it really is not a great design. I am 6\' tall, and the footrest ends up at about mid-calf range, which is not the most comfortable, I still end up needing something to rest my feet on. The armrests could be a little wider, with a little more cushion, maybe a little more ergonomically designed for the gamer, especially if you\'re gaming with a controller. I do however like the idea of the hinge aspect of the armrests, so they move back with you when you recline. Another thing I noticed (mostly due to my height again), is the neck/head pillow height. I find when I am sitting in the chair, that pillow actually ends up at my shoulders, and I can adjust it to where I need it, but as soon as I move it falls back to it\'s normal resting place, and I have to readjust every time I sit back down, so a nice improvement would be to see multiple slots for mounting that to accommodate a wider range of gamers more comfortably. The vibrating lumbar support cushion is a nice touch, it can help a little bit if you\'re getting some tension in your lower back, but it produces quite a loud buzzing sound, so often I don\'t use it, because it\'s just too distracting. The seat cushion is my favorite part of the chair, it\'s actually very nice and easy to sit on for long periods. The seat always tends to be the problem part of a chair for me, it\'s hard to find one comfortable for me to spend any time in without soreness. The long flat cushion spreads out your weight nicely, so there are no pressure points like your tailbone or in your thighs that end up hurting due to excessive pressure on that area. So, all in all, it\'s a decent mid range gaming chair, room for improvement definitely, particularly if you\'re an above average height gamer, but mostly a good solid chair, that is worth the money if you can get it for less than full price.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 12, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Falling apart in less then a year.', 'author': 'Amazon Customer', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'My son hasn’t even had this chair a year and it’s falling apart.

My feet do not touch the ground so its not short (my feet hang about an inch above the ground), but the structure feels somewhat small compared to another gamer chair I had before. Sitting fully upright and butt all the way back, I still have an inch of space before the seat touches the back of my calves, so the seat isn\'t that big too. Now what I do feel too wide is the arm rests, it would be nice if I could move them in more, and if I could adjust them down or up. It\'s tad bit too wide. When the footrest is inside the chair, it\'s upside down and the plastic is a little sharp, so may cut the back of your calves. The lower back-pad with vibrator is nice if using it for vibrator, but its a bit thick if not using it for vibrator, it may get annoying later. Also, the arm rests, underneath them is pretty sharp too.So basically, back-piece is a little short, seat is a little short, armrests are little wide and not adjustable, back-pad is a bit thick, and underneath the arm rests and foot rest is a bit sharp.Its not too bad, but not too good either. It was easy to install, and the wheels are tough to get in, they bit different than other wheels I seen. It is somewhat comfy seat, the back-pad with vibrator is a bit too thick though.This chair is one of the cheaper ones, but still expensive, around $100, so kind of disappointed and kind of expected. It\'s cheaper against the other chairs of its kind, but its not really cheap when you just think about the price.I\'ll probably spend $50 more and get a better chair next time. This chair is cheap compared to others like it, but its still expensive. This chair lacks customization of the features, and could work on smoothing out sharp areas of the chair that I think would make it better and probably 4/5 stars.Also, I think I\'d go with one without vibrator next time too, its nice but its very sturdy and thick, I miss regular cushion. I normally sit with legs somewhat spread apart, and its a bit uncomfortable with these side pieces towards the end of the seat. They a bit too tall and sturdy. It\'s not a bad chair, but could be a lot better. So I give this chair a 3/5.I changed my mind to 1/5, its just not comfortable anymore, the sides on the seat irritate my thighs. I wanted to see the padding, which is good but I noticed they removed all the zipper hangings probably because so many people checking and finding things wrong, so they removed all of them to make it difficult to check. The arm rest is sharp as well as the foot rest when its docked underneath the chair, the back of my calves brush against it. The massage pad I would go without one, its just too stiff and I hardly use it. It pushes you too far in the seat because too thick and I don\'t get to enjoy the headrest due to how thick the massage pad is. Sitting indian style in the chair is uncomfortable too, its just not wide enough and/or the side piece is too tall and sturdy, needs to be bent outwards more and not so pointy.Pictures are showing the sharp plastic underneath the arm rest and an arm can fit in between which is bad due to sharp plastic, the sharp plastic on the footrest, and zipper without zipper grips (they must have ripped them off, due to people inspecting the padding).I just got the chair 13 July, 2020, and already want to return it.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States July 13, 2020', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Arrived Dirty but Beautiful Chair', 'author': 'MysticShan', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'I bought this chair because I needed a new office chair for my apartment.

Bush', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I bought this chair during the Black Friday sale. Given the reasonable price, I was concerned that this chair would be a cheap pile of plastic. In reality, it\'s shockingly well made. Let\'s start from the ground up. The legs are made of metal and not plastic. The casters are the best I\'ve had on any chair. They roll smoothly and well. The seat is padded enough to be supportive. The back is substantial with very good lumbar support. The arms fold up so I can shove the chair under my computer desk so it it\'s in the way. I love this feature! The chair is truly ergonomic. The site tips you forward just slightly. The lumbar back support is in the right place and my elbows rest on the arms while I\'m typing. The height of the chair is easily adjustable with a range of nearly 5 inches. That\'s more than I\'ve seen in other chairs.Now let\'s talk about assembly. The chair came well packed and there were good assembly directions. They provided a long Allen wrench with a long handle. There were extras of every screw and washer. They included white gloves. I thought that was cool but unnecessary. Most of the screw holes aligned well. But I found installation to be a bit frustrating. Don\'t worry, there\'s an easy fix. The chair\'s arms were connected to what they call a ""bracket"". Each arm needed to be attached to the back of the chair first and then to the seat. It was difficult to hold things together at the right angle to insert the screws and washers. The workaround is simple.. recruit two more arms - a spouse, neighbor, kid, etc. They can hold things in the right place while you align, insert, and tighten the screws. The chair only goes together one way so it isn\'t likely that you\'d need to hire a handyman to do it for you.It took me a few hours to put the chair together (including time to look up new curse words on the Urban Dictionary website). The manufacturer provides you with an assembly video but requires that you register the product first. Sure, let\'s give lots of private information to a company I hadn\'t heard of before to register a product I didn\'t now if I was going to keep. ;) In the end, I was pleased that I was able to get the chair all screwed up (Ok, assembled).

I\'m 5\'4"" and all the office chairs I have been given at work seem to be measured for a 6\' tall person. I can never sit all the way back with my feet touching the floor and my arms don\'t sit on the arm rests. After trying 3 different chairs recently, I almost gave up, but I saw this one and thought it might be worth a try. I am so glad I got it. I feel like this chair actually fits me. I can sit all the way back and the lumbar support is fantastic and just where I need it. The seat cushion is perfect, too, as it provides firm support without being too hard. I also love that the arms go up and down because that allows me to sit cross-legged if I want. I will also add that the chair is made from high quality materials - really nice casters, real metal legs, it\'s solid and does not feel flimsy. I\'m kind of amazed at the low price for this quality. Now I\'ve got a really great system for my workday in order to minimize back pain. I can sit in this chair in a few different ways: with my back against the back support and my feet up on a stool, sitting up straight with my feet flat on the floor or on yoga blocks (depending on how high the chair is), or sitting cross-legged. So I alternate between this chair and my standing desk throughout the day and it\'s the best set-up I have ever had. I don\'t think there is any magic office chair if you have back pain.

The seat is well padded, and the back provides lumbar support just where it's needed. The height is adjustable with a lever operated hydraulic lift, and a large knob under the seat lets you adjust how much you can rock the seat back. The two armrests can be lifted. The seat rolls easily on 5 wheels.The only issue I had during assembly was unexpected. For shipping, a lot of the parts are stored inside the seat back.

The packaging was sturdy, reassuring me of its safe transit, yet it had a no-frills approach that suggested practicality over extravagance.The chair's premium PU leather stood out immediately. It promised durability and an easy-to-clean surface, a must for any office environment. The touch was indeed smooth, and the chair's overall design felt modern, with its double layer padding adding a touch of elegance.Adjustability is a key feature here; the 10cm height range and 120° rocking function allow for a good deal of personalization. The foldable armrests at 90° are a thoughtful addition, especially for those working in tight spaces.From a user-friendly perspective, the chair was straightforward to assemble, thanks to clear instructions. The built-in lumbar support and ergonomic design were immediately noticeable, providing comfort during prolonged periods of sitting.Performance-wise, the chair lives up to its ergonomic claims, supporting a healthy posture, which is essential for long work hours. The maximum capacity of 250lbs is also a testament to its sturdy build.When compared to other chairs in its category, this Brick Attic chair holds its own in terms of functionality and design. However, the actual user experience may vary depending on personal preferences for cushion firmness and back support.In terms of value for money, this chair seems to strike a balance between quality and cost, making it an attractive option for those seeking a blend of style, comfort, and durability without breaking the bank.The top positive aspects include its sleek design, user-friendly adjustments, and the quality of the PU leather. Nonetheless, potential improvements could be in providing more recline angles and perhaps enhancing the armrest padding for additional comfort.In summary, this chair is well-suited for anyone looking for a reliable office chair that supports good posture, offers adjustability, and has a modern aesthetic.

I am gaming for like 2-5 hours at a time though, so.... not everyone will have that issue. But definitely invest in a chair cushion. I have the everlasting comfort one, also from Amazon lol.

First of all the color is exactly what was expected - was actually looking for gray color and it looks good and matches the walls of the room where I have placed this.The assembly was straightforward and didn't take much time - about 15-20 mins. The instruction manual included all the relevant details. There were extra nuts and bolts also provided and that also helped immensely as I did lose one bolt at the time of installation.Once installed, the chair is reasonably comfortable and works well. You really have to look at the price here and see what this offers as compared to other more expensive chairs. Two areas where I can see some compromises here are - one, the arms of the chair are not extensible which means that they don't move up / down and cannot be adjusted. The arms also don't have any cushion and therefore when your elbows are resting on the arm, it won't provide the same level of comfort. The other limitation is that this chair doesn't have as good lumbar support as needed. Normally chairs have a component that goes from the backside and your lower back rests on this. This chair doesn't have it. I do feel that within the price, this could have been included.Other than above, the materials used to construct this chair are all good and it does work quite well. It is able to take decent amount of weight and the wheels move well on wooden floor and carpets too.

The casters have to be pushed into the chair frame and were very difficult to push far enough in that they were all even with each other and not fall out. There's a cross shape on the casters, I finally figured out that if you insert the casters and then push down on the shaped part it goes in easier, but it's still hard to do.

Did my research among the top reviewed options and went with this one due to the large flat seat (a lot of office chairs have curved seats, which seems good, but in reality often leads to poor posture and back pain). Another advantage this one has over other similar options is the ability to pull back the arm rests if desired, which is a nice option to have. Having color options was nice as well, I went with standard black, but folks who want their chairs to match a room or desk have that at their disposal.Item arrived in an impressively compact box and assembly was quick and easy. Instructions were straightforward, extra screws were included (not needed since everything was in perfect condition). Took maybe 20 minutes from unboxing to it being ready to use.The back of the chair is a little further back than I'm used to; while I was initially concerned about this it actually is a big plus since it encourages me to maintain a good posture as I'm working but also is comfortable when I went to lean back for a bit. Lastly we have a white cat so I had some mild concerns about my chair turning white, but several weeks in there's barely any hair on it, which is amazing considering how every other piece of furniture has that happen.Overall, extremely satisfied with this purchase several weeks in. The wide stable base provides opportunity to use plenty of different sitting positions for anyone like me that is fidgety.

So you should orient the more square-looking part of each armrest towards the same direction as the ""front"" sticker which is on the bottom of the seat cushion.Second assembly issue: The ""wrench"" tool which comes in the packet of parts won\'t easily work when you\'re trying to attach the backrest to the seat cushion in Step 5. There just isn\'t enough room to turn that ""wrench"" to tighten the screws because the mesh of the backrest and the crossbar of the backrest both get in the way.

The armrests are also adjustable, although I do wish they were positioned a bit more towards the back as I found my elbows hanging off them a bit. The one thing I couldn't test was the lumbar support as the knob on the back fell off during assembly, and the position of my backrest does not provide any. Nothing a back cushion can't fix. Customer support offered to send me a new chair but I decided to just keep this one to avoid the hassle. Assembly was easy and I assembled it myself in 20 minutes with the included instructions, no extra tools required. The chair is heavy, sturdy and was packaged well. Overall, I would recommend this chair to people looking for a reliable affordable and comfortable office chair.

Worth the price!! Not cheap looking at all!', 'author': 'Lauren M. Faul', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'So first of all, if you’re looking for a chair that you can comfortably sit crisscross in this is it. When researching a new office chair since I work from home, it was important to me to find a chair that had enough padding in the seat so that it wouldn’t degrade quickly and that I could genuinely sit comfortable crossing my legs and not hit any pressure points. This chair seat is so thick that I can push on it with all my weight in my hand and I don’t touch a bottom panel at all. It is all cushion. And it is so wide I am almost blown away. I am not a tiny girl and I could sit two of me on this comfortably.I’m not really sure why people are saying that it looks cheap. I got the black PU leather with the gold legs and the leather feels luxurious. It feels sturdy. The gold looks lovely and honestly the wheels move really well. I thought they were going to be cheaper and I would have to replace them right away but they glide really well for stock wheels.Also, whoever provided a negative review, because their box came with gloves, who cares? Mine had gloves and they don’t even look worn. So complaining about that is just silly.Everything arrived safe and sound no damages and well packed.Assembly was quick and simple.Basically, if you struggle with sitting in a regular office chair and you are always on 1 foot or need to cross your legs to be comfortable look no further, and just buy this chair. The ones on TikTok have a significantly flatter seat cushion and look like it would actually hurt your ankles when the padding gets flat, so spend the extra money and get this specific chair. Not to mention office chairs can get extremely expensive if they’re higher quality and this one is perfectly priced for just how good it is.I’m not kidding when I say that the pictures do it justice with just how thick and comfortable the padding is.

Also the material isn’t a soft linen as described. It is more of a rough mesh material. On to the structure of the chair, it is unusually designed the chair is really large (lengthxwidth) compared to the backrest, it also dips in and curves down toward the back. Which causes you to feel like you’re leaning back or more prone to falling back. It is not leveled. Also, this requires two people to put together due to the seat being so thick, one person needs to squeeze it together to screw on the bottom of the chair.

It’s a couple inches wider than some others on Amazon.I did upgrade the lift/piston and base to a white, and heavier duty versions. Both support over 500 lbs. I also upgraded the wheels to rubber ones instead of plastic so it won’t scratch my floors (which I already had on my previous office chair).My complaints:I purchased the beige fabric chair and it appears more grey in person.I don’t like the chair tilt. Yes I can adjust it so it won’t tilt all the way back, but it’s cheap parts and it does tilt slightly into that locked position. I will likely try to replace this piece or configure it so it does not move or tilt the slightest. I do worry about the longevity of the connecting piece from the back to the bottom seat (you will have to assemble yourself). The back of the seat has a metal piece that curves to under the bottom of the seat, and screws in with 4 screws (Allen wrench provided). My concern is this piece bending over time, away from the seat.

The seat is curved but not so much that you feel you\'re sitting in a dip, and also it doesn\'t do that thing where the seat is tilted forward so you feel you may slide off. It\'s a nice almost canvas-y fabric. Not scratchy or itchy but does attract a little static.For all my praise, the shipping was a little rough and two pieces were broken on arrival; although they didn\'t affect the overall function of the chair.

Luckily I saved the ones from my old chair and could supplement the ones that did not work with them. It comes with the hardware and ""T"" alan tool needed to bolt it together, spare bolts, and covers for the bolt holes on the arms. The bolts I had issues with were those for the arms to attach to the seat and the backrest as 4 would not fit. The armrests are comfortable and at the proper height, they also can fold back out of the way. The chair has adjustable tension for reclining back and a decent amount of angle for reclining. The only concern is they are the only thing attaching the back of the chair to the seat/base of the chair which could wear out or become unstable over time. The cushions on the armrests are very comfortable. The wheelbase and main mechanism for the chair that the seat connects to are sturdy and appear durable. I had ordered a pack of the inline skate-type wheels to use instead of the ones that come with the chair which work great, so I will not be able to evaluate the included wheels for this chair. The dimensions of the back and seat are on par with big and tall chairs, and being 6\'4"" and 225 lbs. I fit well in the chair. Now for the main reason I am only giving it 4 stars is something that that would be more of a personal preference for each person. I prefer the cushions to have an abundance of padding for maximum comfort as I spend many hours a day in my office chair. These cushions are ok for limited use, but I am already experiencing buttocks discomfort from multi-hour usage as they are way firmer than I am used to. Those who prefer a firmer chair for back and posture-type concerns, you will love this chair. However, if you are like me and want my chair to be more like a recliner in the way of cushion comfort it may not live up to your expectation during extended use. My last chair was a Lazy Boy Executive chair that had tons of cushion, so my views may be biased in this and that should be taken into consideration when considering my review. Overall, it is a decent Executive Office Chair except for the incorrect hardware supplied and personal preference cushion firmness issues I have covered. I was able to combat the lack of softness in the seat cushion by placing a pillow in the seat which may be an option for those that experience it being too stiff and firm for your tastes.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 9, 2024', 'is_verified': False}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars easy installation', 'author': 'Michael Qin', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""It's very easy to install.

The hardest part was attaching the back to the two side arms and I found it was easier to lay the chair on its side and press the arms to lineup the back to the screw holes. I included pictures of the assembly steps it took maybe 20 minutes to put together from start to finish. I like that the they provided spares as not all furniture and chairs come with spare parts and they provided a plastic padded T-handled hex tool for torqueing all the screws.The back of the chair is not as high as it looks in the picture. I thought I would be able to recline and rest my head against the top of the chair, but my head is above the head rest portion. If you are less than 6 feet tall then it might be fine but not for tall people. The seat is wide so if you're a little bit on the heavy side this chair has more than enough room for most. Length of the seat is proportioned to its width so it relieves pressure on your thighs when sitting, I don't like short length bottom chairs as I find it puts pressure on your hamstrings when sitting for too long.The PU leather or faux leather feels soft to the touch, you can tell right away it's not real leather, but in the price range that this chair sells for I don't expect real leather. The arms fold up but do not adjust in height so you can slide the chair under a desk or table for reduce space when not sitting in the chair. The holes for the castors on the wheels are a little loose so the wheels do have some flex/movement. Over time I don't know if the castors may widen the holes and fall out due to the loose fit.I don't usually sit too long in my desk downstairs maybe an hour at a time to do some work, write emails, or browse the web and this chair felt more comfortable than my last mesh bottom chair it replaced. I can't speak to the durability of the chair as I've only had it a few days and usually things like the gas piston or castors on the wheels that wear out first on office/desk chairs and that's typically after months or maybe a year of use.

The blanket wraps around my shoulders and lap, providing just the right amount of warmth without feeling bulky or restrictive. It's like having a personal, customizable cocoon of comfort.The attachment to the chair is secure and doesn't slip or slide, allowing me to move freely without worrying about it falling off.

I'm only 5'5 and to sit with feet flat on the floor, I need it at its lowest setting. Otherwise, I use footstool. However, if you're taller, I think this would be a great chair. My wife is a couple inches taller than me and has full hips, and she finds this chair comfortable.The seat is not too far back and is shaped ergonomically. It reclines easily and locks into place for when you want to lean back and think or close your eyes. The height is great, and the headrest is in a perfect spot. These types of highback chairs are a must if you work in an office all day long.I found the armrests to be a little high for me. My problem is I'm short with long arms, so it can be tricky to find a comfortable chair. I would opt for the adjustable armrests in this model, but it's still a premium chair that looks and feels great."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 1, 2024', 'is_verified': False}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars RUN AND GET THIS', 'author': 'Milia', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""This chair by far is the best computer chair ive had, and ever sat in.

No matter what delivery instructions I make through Amazon or on FedEx\'s app, they are completely ignored and packages are left in an area that homeless people often piss.Now for the chair itself:I am a large man. I am 6\' 5"", 400 lbs. I know that sounds like a lot but I am surprisingly well distributed if you\'re worried about my dimensions. I have sat in many office chairs from Staples and Best Buy having had worked for both at one point or another. Many of those chairs can be comfortable, even the cheapest of which, but my concern has always been the longevity. After having used this chair a week, that concern is overshadowed by the plethora of issues I have with this chair.The first problem that became apparent is the frame of the seat. The mesh envelopes a sturdy plastic frame that holds it taught and in place. This frame digs into the sides of my but and thighs. It is not immediately painful but after an 8 hour shift, it brings moderate pain like wearing boots all day that dig into your ankle. For another prospective on what size I am for this to affect me, I am large enough that I can feel that digging in my sides from maybe 10% of public chairs, but not enough that I can’t sit on a plane or even need a seatbelt extension. Then there is the leaning mechanism of the chair. The first day, I was able to get the chair back to stand completely upright but have not been able to do it since. Having a chair with back support that I did not have to lean back in was important to me. It is disappointing that I have not been able to find that in this chair because of an already weak leaning mechanism.The last major issue with the chair is the wheels. They were nearly impossible to put into place and all but one has issues with swiveling. Because of this, I find it nearly impossible to coast around. Did I mention I worked for Staples? During my year there, I put together many chairs for demos and people who paid for assembly. This is the only time I have ever had an issue with brand new office chair wheels. One more minor issue: the leg rest is useless. I paid the extra $40 for it and it barely props up my long legs and feels very wobbly.Overall, I will be looking for a replacement and this chair is going to make its way back to Amazon soon.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 29, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Well worth the price', 'author': 'Simone', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Chair was a perfect replacement for my office chair that needed an upgrade.

During assembly, attaching the seat to the backrest was kind of tricky. If you have an extra set of hands, assembly could probably be reduced to around 10-15 minutes.

Got this for my wife, who often has sciatic pain and works a job that lends itself to a lot of sitting/in-front-of-computer time, and overall it has been a good purchase that I think punches above its weight price-wise. Is it a $1000+ desk chair, no. But it was (1) very easy to assemble out of the box, (2) provides pretty good back support with the adjustable mid-back support piece, (3) is easy to raise and lower, and (4) is just overall comfortable.She is around 5\'7"" and I\'m 6\'0"", and both of us find the height of the chairback to be appropriate (although we both prefer there to be no headrest on this sort of chair, so if you prefer to have one, be aware that this doesn\'t hit above your shoulder blades or lower neck depending on your height). We\'ve had the chair for around four months now and all of the adjustable features still work the way they\'re supposed to, and we\'re just as happy with it as when we first put it together.One con worth flagging: adjusting how easy it is to rock back and forth should take less effort than it does. The lever that controls the seat height (by pulling up or pushing down, as is the case with most desk chairs) also locks or unlocks the chair\'s rocking feature (by pulling out to unlock or pushing in to lock). That works well enough. Once you\'ve unlocked the chair so that it can rock, you can then adjust how easy it is to rock using a knob on the underside of the seat. The problem is that the knob is much, much harder to turn, and requires many more turns, than it should be. This isn\'t a huge deal for us since our preference is generally to leave the chair in its easiest-to-rock setting, but it requires a surprising amount of effort and number of turns to go from the easiest-to-rock setting to the hardest.That said, while a bit annoying that con certainly isn\'t a dealbreaker all things considered (especially the price).

This makes it an ideal choice for individuals with a larger build.The chair is equipped with ergonomic lumbar support that can be easily adjusted to meet individual preferences. Its flexibility allows for forward or backward movement, which helps with spinal support, relieving back pressure, and comfort for extended periods of work, study, or gaming. The cushion is well padded which is crafted with thick foam, it adds to the overall comfort.It offers a 360° free swivel and a 3.94-inch adjustable height. To safeguard my floor, I use a floor mat to prevent any potential scratching from the wheels.

You don\'t get sick of it.ALso COMFORTABLE - soft, not mushy, firm... so it will last longer. Went together EASILY. ONLY CON is the tool they include. It appears to be a nice ""T"" hex wrench. It worked well until I had to tighten screws and it quickly STRIPPED being made of cheap metal. (non hardened). Luckily, I have a lot of quality Hex wrenches here and finished.Boxed VERY NICELY - well padded, parts in a nice compartment/package. Even extras. Not a flaw on the chair anywhere.

VERY nice chair for the price.I\'m in it now as I type this. So TOOL was crap - and it also doesn\'t go quite as low as I would have liked. It will work... but it would work better if it would drop another 2-3 inches. My keyboard tray comes out under my desk and is lower than the desk and my knees can\'t fit under it.SO FAR (a couple hours) I would buy again!!! very smooth rotation and smooth rocker. My last one LOCKED at various angles and I do miss that. But I\'ll get used to this. Feels nice, not glossy, nice flat surface. I\'ll attach pics. It\'s not really khaki - it\'s more of a TAN or milky caramel.UPDATE - loved it so much I bought my grandson one for his computer room.HOWEVER it\'s now about a year later for mine and I have one complaint. Hoping the company reads this and changes it. The ""ARM PADS"" are made up of several thinner layers of foam. They do not stay put, the layers slide around on top of each other. (think of it like a deck of cards). And they get sloppy inside the covering. Both arms have layers of foam inside moving around in various directions. = ( This could easily be remedied with a single pad or a way to bind or wrap the pad layers before covering them. They now look misshapen and I feel the layers moving under my arms.

Well, COVID happened and now my job is four days telework and one day in the office. While I do enjoy this schedule, my previous WFH chair was not up to the task of supporting my fat ass. As the current schedule will continue, my ( male, 5\'10"", 245 lbs.) body needed a good WFH chair that did not break my budget. After looking at several different options at my local ""office supply store"" the conclusion was that the mesh type of chairs are out and the costs were not realistically aligned with the quality of the seating experience. Padding, seat comfort, seat back height were the main drivers of my search. Secondary were ease of assembly and color choices. After test sitting in various models and on-line research, I took a gamble on this chair. Was not disappointed as this chair was easy to put together (although I do recommend having someone to help as it\'s easier if they\'re there to hold some sections during the armrest assembly portion) but otherwise very simple to do. They even included spare screws in case one gets lost or damaged during the setup. Very easy to follow instructions should not be a problem for anyone to follow (if even needed). Now I did have a minor issue after the first few days and I emailed their customer service folks (actually, it was a reply to them reaching out in a follow up to see if I was happy) and they got back to me right away. Their solution to my issue was very quick and 100% perfect as far as I\'m concerned. While I can\'t speak about the longevity of the chair, for the time I\'ve been using it has been comfortable, good looking (as if that really matters in a WFH situation, but some may find it important) and I\'m very happy with my purchase.

Worth the price!! Not cheap looking at all!', 'author': 'Lauren M. Faul', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'So first of all, if you’re looking for a chair that you can comfortably sit crisscross in this is it. When researching a new office chair since I work from home, it was important to me to find a chair that had enough padding in the seat so that it wouldn’t degrade quickly and that I could genuinely sit comfortable crossing my legs and not hit any pressure points. This chair seat is so thick that I can push on it with all my weight in my hand and I don’t touch a bottom panel at all. It is all cushion. And it is so wide I am almost blown away. I am not a tiny girl and I could sit two of me on this comfortably.I’m not really sure why people are saying that it looks cheap. I got the black PU leather with the gold legs and the leather feels luxurious. It feels sturdy. The gold looks lovely and honestly the wheels move really well. I thought they were going to be cheaper and I would have to replace them right away but they glide really well for stock wheels.Also, whoever provided a negative review, because their box came with gloves, who cares? Mine had gloves and they don’t even look worn. So complaining about that is just silly.Everything arrived safe and sound no damages and well packed.Assembly was quick and simple.Basically, if you struggle with sitting in a regular office chair and you are always on 1 foot or need to cross your legs to be comfortable look no further, and just buy this chair. The ones on TikTok have a significantly flatter seat cushion and look like it would actually hurt your ankles when the padding gets flat, so spend the extra money and get this specific chair. Not to mention office chairs can get extremely expensive if they’re higher quality and this one is perfectly priced for just how good it is.I’m not kidding when I say that the pictures do it justice with just how thick and comfortable the padding is. I can’t speak to how the fabric version is particularly but just know for the leather ones that it’s plush.I’ve been using it for a couple of days now and I just love it but if anything changes I will update.I only ever really write reviews for things that really surprised me or would highly recommend to friends and family so stop looking at cheaper alternatives and just get this one.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 25, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '1.0 out of 5 stars Poor Quality, Returning', 'author': 'Anna M.', 'rating': 1, 'content': 'Just received this chair, opened the box and there was gloves left in it, thought that was a little strange but accidents happen.

Also the material isn’t a soft linen as described. It is more of a rough mesh material. On to the structure of the chair, it is unusually designed the chair is really large (lengthxwidth) compared to the backrest, it also dips in and curves down toward the back. Which causes you to feel like you’re leaning back or more prone to falling back. It is not leveled.

But the trade off is that it made for a much more sturdy base compared to the usual plastic office chair bases that you just pop on. I’m confident this chair will last.

I had assembled a similar chair back in November but had talked myself out of the wheely option, hence this purchase. I steamed into assembly with the confidence of a toddler in a superhero costume, only to be thwarted by the hellistic chamber that hold the legs. I don\'t know if the ring to hold the flanges at the end of the legs was purposely made to be infinitesimally too small to drive you into a self-doubting spiral or if it\'s just suppose to be that snug, regardless, I had to pull out my hand hammer to ""assist"" the final leg into it\'s groove, only to have the whole thing to collapse like the death star once I placed it in my trunk to transport it to my office. Luckily I was able to restore the delicate balance on the floor of my office and hopefully I won\'t end up on my ass by the end of the day but who doesn\'t like a little drama in the workplace?Parting words: super thick seat, pretty stinking deep, as well (i might need a pillow).

I needed something I knew would support us, and I’m very satisfied with the main chair piece. I’m 5’9” and my partner over 6’5”; we can both very comfortably sit criss-cross on this chair. It’s a couple inches wider than some others on Amazon.I did upgrade the lift/piston and base to a white, and heavier duty versions. Both support over 500 lbs. I also upgraded the wheels to rubber ones instead of plastic so it won’t scratch my floors (which I already had on my previous office chair).My complaints:I purchased the beige fabric chair and it appears more grey in person.I don’t like the chair tilt. Yes I can adjust it so it won’t tilt all the way back, but it’s cheap parts and it does tilt slightly into that locked position. I will likely try to replace this piece or configure it so it does not move or tilt the slightest. I do worry about the longevity of the connecting piece from the back to the bottom seat (you will have to assemble yourself). The back of the seat has a metal piece that curves to under the bottom of the seat, and screws in with 4 screws (Allen wrench provided). My concern is this piece bending over time, away from the seat. Another reason to prevent the chair from tilting.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 21, 2023', 'is_verified': True}]"

My old one was getting pretty worn out after three and a half years, especially since I work from home and use it a lot. I usually don't spend a lot on chairs, but my last one, despite being a bit pricey, didn't last as well as I hoped. The leather started to wear out in less than two years and it wasn't as comfortable anymore.What drew me to this new chair was its reasonable price, especially for a high back model. I don't often lean back, but when I do, I like having good back and neck support.The chair was delivered in good packaging. I've added photos of it before and after opening, so you can see how well it was packed. I've put together quite a few office chairs before, so assembling this one wasn't a big deal. The instructions were clear and the screws were nicely sorted into different compartments, which made it easier. It took me about 18 minutes to put it together using the tool provided, but if you have your own allen wrench, it might be a bit quicker. Overall, the assembly was simple and straightforward.After putting it together, I noticed a few things. The chair doesn't have those little screw covers that some other chairs come with. It's not a huge issue, but those covers usually make the chair look nicer. The lumbar support isn't adjustable, but it's made of a soft mesh material that's quite comfortable. I didn't feel the need to adjust it. The neck support is really good – it's adjustable, so you can get it just right when you lean back. That's a big plus for me. The seat cushion is also firm and covered with the same cloth material as the back. Coming from an older, well-used chair, this was a noticeable change, but I prefer a firmer seat. I'll have to wait and see how it holds up in terms of warmth and breathability.The chair feels sturdy now that it's assembled, and I could adjust it to my liking. One thing to note is that the armrests don't lift up. They're fixed, so you can't raise them to slide the chair under a desk, which might be a downside for some. But overall, considering the price, I think it's a good value.

Instructions were easy to follow. The chair came with hardware and comes with its own allen wrench. The screws use 1 size allen wrench and are easy to tell which screws go where. The screws come with thread locker to ensure they stay tight after installing. The manufacture includes an extra set of screws which is always good to have for back up.Pros:The chair is designed with ergonomic in mind. Has a little bit of what a chair should have: mesh material, lumbar support, headrest. Seat is soft and plenty of room for me to cross my legs. Chair has rocking feature and adjustable height.Con:The chair is not comfortable for my liking. The mesh fabric is NOT taut: the back is loose and the head rest is unbearable. I can feel my neck rest on the bracing of the headrest and is very uncomfortable for long term use. The lumbar does not have enough lumbar. It does not compliment the curve of my back. Sits flat parallel to the back and does not wrap my back at all. The only thing I find comfortable in this chair is the seat bottom.Conclusion:This chair is not bad at all. Do not steer away from this chair. I am only giving my opinion on what this chair was to me. I have had many chairs over the years ranging from $10 to $800 chairs. From what I learned through my own research and what I find comfortable is very subjective to what you may like or dislike. However, this chair is a big upgrade from a dining chair or folding chair.The price of this chair is very reasonable. However, I find that chairs are an investment.

The four layers of thickened spring foam in the cushion provide exceptional support, reducing the burden on my thighs and buttocks, allowing me to sit comfortably for extended periods and enhancing my overall work efficiency.What truly sets this chair apart is its ergonomic design. The curved backrest naturally conforms to the lumbar and back, alleviating fatigue and providing unmatched comfort. The retractable headrest and padded armrests offer additional support, making it ideal for a variety of uses, including offices, homes, conference rooms, gaming tables, and executive desks. The chair's versatility is further enhanced by its 90° flip-up armrests, a feature that not only saves space but also reduces pressure on the shoulders and neck during prolonged periods of work.The ability to adjust the seat back angle from 90° to 135°, along with rocking and locking modes, allows me to customize my sitting posture according to my preferences. This level of flexibility is a game-changer for those looking to optimize their comfort throughout the day.Assembling the chair was a breeze, taking only 20-30 minutes with the comprehensive instructions and installation video provided in the package.

Happy with purchase.', 'author': 'Sydney Mitchell', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'I actually do really like this chair, it\'s far better than the one I had before.The back of the chair does not extend to above my head (I\'m 5\'8"") as my previous gaming chair did, so I have to kind of scoot down in the chair to lean my head fully back if I want to rest it like that. The material feels nice and soft, and the cushion to the back and seat are comfortable. I do enjoy the leg rest, it feels a little bit like it wouldn\'t hold a lot of weight, but luckily it suits me fine.Massage/Heat:The massage feature is vibration. It has 5 modes: pulse, press, wave, auto, and normal. 2 Intensities (high and low). 4 massage points: neck, back, lumbar, and thigh. It has a timer for 15, 30, and 60 mins, after which it will turn off automatically. The Heat feature is a separate button to be pressed when the power is turned on. You can use it with the massage feature or solo, but to do it solo you would have to individually turn off each of the 4 massage points (they each have their own button). I\'ve used this feature often as I like the warmth without the vibration mostly.Both features are a nice little extra touch to the chair for me. I wasn\'t expecting it to be on the same level as an actual massage chair with rollers or something, so it works fine for what I was intending. The heating feature is not as hot as my heating pad, but it adds a nice warmth that I find pleasant without being too hot (which is good because there are only 2 intensity settings for the heat).One Complaint: The only thing about this feature that is annoying is the need to plug the chair in to use it. This wouldn\'t be as much of a problem if I wasn\'t accidentally rolling over the small wire with the chair and then getting worried about it getting stuck in the wheels.Stability:The chair itself feels a little unstable. I\'m not sure if this is the way it was designed or the way we put it together (though we put it together as instructed). The arms wobble from side to side, as does the base of the chair, which does bother me. I think they do that because they\'re not in a ""fixed"" position, that way when you use the function of reclining the chair the arms can adjust as necessary. They aren\'t as much of an issue for me. It\'s more a problem of feeling like the seat itself rocks a little too much from side to side (right to left not front to back).When I lean back sometimes the chair makes a popping sound (which I figured out is the same sound that happens when you pull the leaver underneath in order to adjust the recline of the back of the chair). I\'m not sure if that\'s functioning as intended or some screw is perhaps not fully right, or maybe poor design.The wheels occasionally feel difficult to slide around on the floor, I think because they all have to turn and align in the same direction, and they don\'t turn immediately when you go to slide away from the desk, so sometimes it feels difficult to move.When my mother (a bigger woman) sat in the chair it made it slide downwards, and this was an issue that happened each time she did it. This makes me think it\'s not meant to hold as much weight as other chairs so be careful with that.Overall for what I needed out of a chair, it\'s been nice. I spent a lot of time researching and looking for a new chair, which was difficult given the fact that I couldn\'t test them out beforehand. I wanted one with a footrest, and massage/heat, that was also soft to sit in. This one fits a lot of the qualities I was looking for, enough so that I can overlook the parts that bother me.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States April 6, 2021', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '3.0 out of 5 stars Seems pretty good so far....', 'author': 'Lindy Fredrick', 'rating': 3, 'content': ""Arrived well packaged, assembly took 1 hour, could be quicker if I used a power tool.

I expected more cushion, seems a little firm and thin. I stand 6 foot 2 inches with a 36 inch inseam and my head hits right in the middle of the headrest. The foot rest is an utter failure though, it barely reaches the middle of my calves and I feel like the weight of my legs is putting a significant strain on it ( I weigh in at 215 pounds), I'll stick with putting my feet up on my desk.

The directions were fine, and all the parts were good quality and easy to put together. The arms seem a little wobbly, but they don't feel like they're going to come off or anything; they just wobble a bit.The padding is comfortable but not plush. I put a very soft, fluffy throw blanket on the chair to sit on and it feels extremely comfy like that. The footrest slides out straight from under the seat, and then the padded part flips up and over. It can be a little tricky to get it out when your legs are under the desk, but it's comfortable once it's in place.The height is adjustable, of course, and what I really like is that the back can be adjusted to whatever angle you like and then locked in place. With a lot of chairs, they lean back all the way and there's no way to lock them at a slightly leaned back angle, and I love that this one does that.The vibrating massage function is really nice. The first time I turned it on I wasn't sure how much I liked it, but I tried it for a few minutes, and it really does feel good. It's very customizable, you can pick from neck, upper/lower back, and thighs or any combination of those areas. You can pick whether the massage is continuous, pulsed, in a wave, etc. The massage and heat functions are both on a timer and you can pick from 15, 30 or 60 minutes.The heat function is very nice especially as the weather gets colder. You can have the massage on with or without heat. At first I thought you couldn't have heat without massage, but you can - you turn on massage, turn on heat, and then de-select all the individual massage areas so you just get heat.As a whole the chair is really nice for working from home. It's pretty sturdy, looks and feels nice, and has a bunch of luxurious feeling options like the footrest, massage and heat, and adjustable back. The power cord for the massage/heat is kind of short and gets wound around the base of the chair if I'm not careful but I guess there's not a good way around that.

I timed myself and without rushing anything it took me a little under half an hour from opening the box to having it fully assembled. The instructions were adequate.There doesn\'t seem to be any way to lock the armrests in place to keep them from rotating, and they rotate easily when bumped, but it doesn\'t seem to be a big deal.It\'s really nice to have a chair that fits me properly.

I highly recommend keeping the box intact for use during the assembly process. Assembling the back, seat, and arm rests using the box as an upright assembly table makes it a lot more manageable. The assembly itself takes about 15-30 minutes. There is a video on the website that is very handy. Also the user manual is very well written. All the tools and parts needed (along with some spares) are included and are well labeled.Once assembled, the chair looks really good. In my case, I am replacing a 40 year old leather executive high back chair where rolling the chair has been challenging and the adjustments are limited and not easily done. I like the styling on this chair and I don’t miss the styling of the previous chair (the only thing it really had going for it). The adjustments are many and easy to operate. The seat is comfortable and the mesh keeps the chair cool and comfortable even with long sittings. The height, tilt, lumbar, arm rests, and head rests have multiple adjustment positions with most accessible while sitting on the chair. Again, the user manual and video on the site are excellent to demonstrate how to operate the many adjustments.I have carpeting in my study as well as an area rug. The chair would be just fine on its own if it was sitting just on carpet. But the large area rug creates a plushness that makes the rollers a little hard to move, so I am continuing to use a glass floor mat. And it rolls incredibly smoothly.I am thrilled with this chair.

The chair is medium hard to assemble. I did it in about 1/2 hour.2. The support legs have a chrome plated cover that is plastic. Does nothing be enhance the look of the chair. This will appeal to some buyers but it is worthless to increase the usefulness of the chair. I did not install it and threw it in the garbage.3. The chair legs have very small wheels. I find it hard to move around my desk area.4. There is a foot rest that slides out to support your feet when extended for a nap. I removed it from the chair and put it in the garbage. It has terrible fitment and slides out when you don\'t want it to. It needs to have tighter slide bearings that will keep it in place when not wanted.5. There is a cover piece of plastic that serves no other use than to cover up some of the mechanism of the lumbar support. I threw it in the garbage. There was another plastic piece that when I pushed it home two of the feet broke off. I threw it in the garbage.6. The lumbar support is not adjustable. It keeps you from resting your full back against the chair back. I find it acceptable given the cost of the chair but needs to be redesigned to lessen the bulge or be made adjustable.7. The designers could have eliminated some of the fluff and lowered the cost of the chair without changing the function of the chair. Steve Jobs would hate this chair.Comments to the designer. Eliminate all of the fluff, fix the lumbar support, fix the leg support slide bearings, get rid of the useless plastic covers, and lower the cost to less than $200. It should outsell the competition.This chair was designed and manufactured in China. Even so, the cost and the function of the chair for the way I use it is acceptable. I give it a 7 out of 10.

This is the one I selected hoping I would not have to send it back to Amazon.November 3, 2023: Repair of the Height Adjustment Cylinder.Starting in Late September 2023, the chair height adjustment cylinder started failing by lowering the chair to it lowest position. I am 6-foot and it is not comfortable at that position. I went to the local auto parts store and purchased two each stainless steel 1.5"" diameter band clamps. I extended the chair to maximum height and installed the two band clamps back to back as show in the attached picture. This fixed the seat at its maximum height. There is a rubber gasket like material that got chewed up and fell on the floor. After a few days, I vacuumed it up and the pieces have not returned. It took longer to buy the band clamps than it did to fix them on the chair. The cost was less than $10.00.

It is very very comfy. Possibly more so than my previous chair. I am also very happy that I was able to find a chair like this that wasn't made with leather.Unfortunately, it seems to be difficult to find chairs made with real metal.

Hopefully this chair will do the same.The real reason I took away a star, however, is simply because of the size. The back rest is a lot smaller than I expected. Now that may be my fault for not paying attention to the dimensions, but honestly, I figured my old chair was a pretty standard size for office chairs. Its to soon to tell how this will affect me over longer periods of time, but again, time will tell.At the end of the day, I needed a new chair that was good looking and comfy and this chair is both of those things.

Luckily I saved the ones from my old chair and could supplement the ones that did not work with them. It comes with the hardware and ""T"" alan tool needed to bolt it together, spare bolts, and covers for the bolt holes on the arms. The bolts I had issues with were those for the arms to attach to the seat and the backrest as 4 would not fit. The armrests are comfortable and at the proper height, they also can fold back out of the way. The chair has adjustable tension for reclining back and a decent amount of angle for reclining. The only concern is they are the only thing attaching the back of the chair to the seat/base of the chair which could wear out or become unstable over time. The cushions on the armrests are very comfortable. The wheelbase and main mechanism for the chair that the seat connects to are sturdy and appear durable. I had ordered a pack of the inline skate-type wheels to use instead of the ones that come with the chair which work great, so I will not be able to evaluate the included wheels for this chair. The dimensions of the back and seat are on par with big and tall chairs, and being 6\'4"" and 225 lbs. I fit well in the chair. Now for the main reason I am only giving it 4 stars is something that that would be more of a personal preference for each person. I prefer the cushions to have an abundance of padding for maximum comfort as I spend many hours a day in my office chair. These cushions are ok for limited use, but I am already experiencing buttocks discomfort from multi-hour usage as they are way firmer than I am used to. Those who prefer a firmer chair for back and posture-type concerns, you will love this chair. However, if you are like me and want my chair to be more like a recliner in the way of cushion comfort it may not live up to your expectation during extended use. My last chair was a Lazy Boy Executive chair that had tons of cushion, so my views may be biased in this and that should be taken into consideration when considering my review. Overall, it is a decent Executive Office Chair except for the incorrect hardware supplied and personal preference cushion firmness issues I have covered. I was able to combat the lack of softness in the seat cushion by placing a pillow in the seat which may be an option for those that experience it being too stiff and firm for your tastes.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 9, 2024', 'is_verified': False}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars easy installation', 'author': 'Michael Qin', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""It's very easy to install.

I included pictures of the assembly steps it took maybe 20 minutes to put together from start to finish. I like that the they provided spares as not all furniture and chairs come with spare parts and they provided a plastic padded T-handled hex tool for torqueing all the screws.The back of the chair is not as high as it looks in the picture. I thought I would be able to recline and rest my head against the top of the chair, but my head is above the head rest portion. If you are less than 6 feet tall then it might be fine but not for tall people. The seat is wide so if you're a little bit on the heavy side this chair has more than enough room for most. Length of the seat is proportioned to its width so it relieves pressure on your thighs when sitting, I don't like short length bottom chairs as I find it puts pressure on your hamstrings when sitting for too long.The PU leather or faux leather feels soft to the touch, you can tell right away it's not real leather, but in the price range that this chair sells for I don't expect real leather. The arms fold up but do not adjust in height so you can slide the chair under a desk or table for reduce space when not sitting in the chair. The holes for the castors on the wheels are a little loose so the wheels do have some flex/movement. Over time I don't know if the castors may widen the holes and fall out due to the loose fit.I don't usually sit too long in my desk downstairs maybe an hour at a time to do some work, write emails, or browse the web and this chair felt more comfortable than my last mesh bottom chair it replaced. I can't speak to the durability of the chair as I've only had it a few days and usually things like the gas piston or castors on the wheels that wear out first on office/desk chairs and that's typically after months or maybe a year of use. Overall the chair works as designed and is comfortable enough for my uses and I don't have any major complaints."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 30, 2023', 'is_verified': False}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars comfortable and ergonomic chair', 'author': 'Bella', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'As I spent long hours working at a computer, having a comfortable and supportive chair is essential.

At its maximum height, it\'s approximately 19.5"" from the floor. The seat is fairly comfortable, a bit firm, and, in my opinion, somewhat narrow. It is just a little over 20"" across at its widest; the same measurement applies to the space measured between the arm rests when in the folded-down position.

Happy with purchase.', 'author': 'Sydney Mitchell', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'I actually do really like this chair, it\'s far better than the one I had before.The back of the chair does not extend to above my head (I\'m 5\'8"") as my previous gaming chair did, so I have to kind of scoot down in the chair to lean my head fully back if I want to rest it like that. The material feels nice and soft, and the cushion to the back and seat are comfortable. I do enjoy the leg rest, it feels a little bit like it wouldn\'t hold a lot of weight, but luckily it suits me fine.Massage/Heat:The massage feature is vibration. It has 5 modes: pulse, press, wave, auto, and normal. 2 Intensities (high and low). 4 massage points: neck, back, lumbar, and thigh. It has a timer for 15, 30, and 60 mins, after which it will turn off automatically. The Heat feature is a separate button to be pressed when the power is turned on. You can use it with the massage feature or solo, but to do it solo you would have to individually turn off each of the 4 massage points (they each have their own button). I\'ve used this feature often as I like the warmth without the vibration mostly.Both features are a nice little extra touch to the chair for me. I wasn\'t expecting it to be on the same level as an actual massage chair with rollers or something, so it works fine for what I was intending. The heating feature is not as hot as my heating pad, but it adds a nice warmth that I find pleasant without being too hot (which is good because there are only 2 intensity settings for the heat).One Complaint: The only thing about this feature that is annoying is the need to plug the chair in to use it. This wouldn\'t be as much of a problem if I wasn\'t accidentally rolling over the small wire with the chair and then getting worried about it getting stuck in the wheels.Stability:The chair itself feels a little unstable. I\'m not sure if this is the way it was designed or the way we put it together (though we put it together as instructed). The arms wobble from side to side, as does the base of the chair, which does bother me. I think they do that because they\'re not in a ""fixed"" position, that way when you use the function of reclining the chair the arms can adjust as necessary. They aren\'t as much of an issue for me. It\'s more a problem of feeling like the seat itself rocks a little too much from side to side (right to left not front to back).When I lean back sometimes the chair makes a popping sound (which I figured out is the same sound that happens when you pull the leaver underneath in order to adjust the recline of the back of the chair). I\'m not sure if that\'s functioning as intended or some screw is perhaps not fully right, or maybe poor design.The wheels occasionally feel difficult to slide around on the floor, I think because they all have to turn and align in the same direction, and they don\'t turn immediately when you go to slide away from the desk, so sometimes it feels difficult to move.When my mother (a bigger woman) sat in the chair it made it slide downwards, and this was an issue that happened each time she did it. This makes me think it\'s not meant to hold as much weight as other chairs so be careful with that.Overall for what I needed out of a chair, it\'s been nice. I spent a lot of time researching and looking for a new chair, which was difficult given the fact that I couldn\'t test them out beforehand. I wanted one with a footrest, and massage/heat, that was also soft to sit in. This one fits a lot of the qualities I was looking for, enough so that I can overlook the parts that bother me.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States April 6, 2021', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '3.0 out of 5 stars Seems pretty good so far....', 'author': 'Lindy Fredrick', 'rating': 3, 'content': ""Arrived well packaged, assembly took 1 hour, could be quicker if I used a power tool.

I expected more cushion, seems a little firm and thin. I stand 6 foot 2 inches with a 36 inch inseam and my head hits right in the middle of the headrest. The foot rest is an utter failure though, it barely reaches the middle of my calves and I feel like the weight of my legs is putting a significant strain on it ( I weigh in at 215 pounds), I'll stick with putting my feet up on my desk.

The arms seem a little wobbly, but they don't feel like they're going to come off or anything; they just wobble a bit.The padding is comfortable but not plush. I put a very soft, fluffy throw blanket on the chair to sit on and it feels extremely comfy like that. The footrest slides out straight from under the seat, and then the padded part flips up and over. It can be a little tricky to get it out when your legs are under the desk, but it's comfortable once it's in place.The height is adjustable, of course, and what I really like is that the back can be adjusted to whatever angle you like and then locked in place. With a lot of chairs, they lean back all the way and there's no way to lock them at a slightly leaned back angle, and I love that this one does that.The vibrating massage function is really nice. The first time I turned it on I wasn't sure how much I liked it, but I tried it for a few minutes, and it really does feel good. It's very customizable, you can pick from neck, upper/lower back, and thighs or any combination of those areas. You can pick whether the massage is continuous, pulsed, in a wave, etc. The massage and heat functions are both on a timer and you can pick from 15, 30 or 60 minutes.The heat function is very nice especially as the weather gets colder. You can have the massage on with or without heat. At first I thought you couldn't have heat without massage, but you can - you turn on massage, turn on heat, and then de-select all the individual massage areas so you just get heat.As a whole the chair is really nice for working from home. It's pretty sturdy, looks and feels nice, and has a bunch of luxurious feeling options like the footrest, massage and heat, and adjustable back. The power cord for the massage/heat is kind of short and gets wound around the base of the chair if I'm not careful but I guess there's not a good way around that.

As such, my rating was determined by comparing these two chairs to each other. I loved my last chair. It was extremely comfy (until the cushion gave out after so many years) and extremely sturdy (the armrests were actually metal).Let me start with what I like about this new Serta chair. It is very very comfy. Possibly more so than my previous chair. I am also very happy that I was able to find a chair like this that wasn't made with leather.Unfortunately, it seems to be difficult to find chairs made with real metal. The arms on this Serta chair do seem to be made with a very sturdy plastic. Time will tell if they hold up. I do a lot of gaming and I tend to squirm and sit in every-changing which often puts pressure on the armrests. The old chair withstood a lot of abuse and has held up great. Hopefully this chair will do the same.The real reason I took away a star, however, is simply because of the size. The back rest is a lot smaller than I expected. Now that may be my fault for not paying attention to the dimensions, but honestly, I figured my old chair was a pretty standard size for office chairs. Its to soon to tell how this will affect me over longer periods of time, but again, time will tell.At the end of the day, I needed a new chair that was good looking and comfy and this chair is both of those things.

The armrests especially because of body oils especially.#2 the supports for the armrests are so far forward that I find it hard to open my legs. No ""manspreading"" possible.#3 the ""tilt control"" is really just a ""tilt lock""--it doesn\'t allow you to lock it a set angle. If you lock it in you\'re set at the default flat tilt; if you unlock you\'re just rocking back and forth.#4 it has some stability issues. It doesnt take much lean back or to the side before 1-2 wheels lift off the ground.#5 not sure what the pillow-looking thing is at the top, but its way too low to serve as a headrest--unless you\'re child-sized or you slouch a lot.#6 minor setup issue: the thread-lock compound they put on the screws was so thick that it made it hard to screw them in--seemed like it was mis-threaded until you got 75% of the way in, then it was excessively loose.There are a couple pros:#1 the armrests seem really sturdy.#2 the fabric is really comfortable--soft without being slick like microfiberUpdate October 10, 2019:Its getting pretty close to dropping down to 1 star.After daily use for 1 month the previously identified problems have not improved and new problems have arisen.Chair is pretty unstable in common situations. Its tipped on me 3 times now just leaning to the side to pick up a fallen object. And by ""tipped"" I mean dumped me to the floor.I thought there was at least two tilt angles you could lock it into, but there\'s really only ""straight flat"" or ""rocks back and forth"". The chair is not designed to lock the angle to anything but parallel to the floor.The control to raise the seat is entirely too far back and down.

Very disappointed to spend this much on a chair and now be so at the end of my rope I'm going to go buy a pipe wrench and a new cylinder, an additional $50 to have a chair that works as advertised.Edit: After several months of use I've noticed the base of the chair was drilled off center (can be seen in the picture) and leans slightly to one side.

I had my doubts about it at first, but have raised my initial 3 star rating to a 5 star! Read my last update below for more info, but I am still using the chair to get around the house some of the time although I am beginning to walk a few steps here and there again since my severe injury back in November. I really thought that the wheels were going to give out since they aren\'t designed for how I\'ve been using the chair, but they are still fine! It\'s still very comfortable, and I\'ve had no problems with it.If you spend a lot of time in the chair, I\'d recommend after a few months going back and tightening the screws that hold the arms to the base and the back. I did that last month and they had loosened a bit from when I first put it together. I\'m keeping the allen wrench that came with the chair in my office close at hand so I can keep checking their tightness every couple of months or so. VERY happy with this, so well worth the money!UPDATE: 1/31/18 I\'ve now had this chair for nearly 5 months. I decided to keep it since I could not find one I liked better, and needed a chair ASAP. I\'m significantly more impressed with it now than I was when I first received it! My initial review was three stars, I\'ve now increased that to four stars.Over two months ago, I tore a ligament in my foot. Major issues with getting around! I ended up grabbing my office chair here, and using it to sit in, using my good foot to push myself around the house. I\'ve been doing this for two months, and it has been so extraordinarily helpful! I am a bit concerned that the wheels might be starting to give out, but then again the amount of wear and tear I\'ve put on them in the past two months is significantly more than one would normally rolling office chair around.I have adapted to the shape of the chair, and find it so much more comfortable now than I did at first. I love how soft the back is, I\'ve adjusted to the seat being harder and tilted a bit. The padding on the arms is an extra bonus. I would bring this up to five stars if I weren\'t so concerned still about how the arms attached to the seat and the back. Still concerned about longevity.-------------------------------------I received this chair yesterday (9/7/17). It was not nearly as easy to put together as the listing makes it seem, it would be much easier with two people. Finally have it together and using it.First off, most of the parts are plastic. Very poor quality. Not sure if I will keep this or send it back at this point. I purchased this because my very old previous desk chair fell apart recently, resulting in a frightening neck injury. The arms are held onto the seat by 2 screws each, and the back is only held onto the arms by another 2 screws on each side. The back does not directly attach to the seat at all. I\'m feeling very concerned about it breaking like my old one did (although that one had been used for several years first!).I\'m also very disappointed that the seat doesn\'t go any lower. I\'m a 5\'3"" woman with short legs. I can\'t come close to touching the floor with my feet, even with this on the lowest setting. Seems ridiculous to me; I know many women who are much shorter than I am! Dangling my feet in the air like a child is not conducive to working at my desk or feeling remotely comfortable.There is also a lack of comfort in this chair. With padded upholstery, I expected to have a bit of a cushy feel in the seat, and it is quite hard. The fabric itself is soft, but you definitely don\'t sink down into the seat at all. I also greatly dislike how the front of the seat slopes downward, which is really uncomfortable in any seated position. Makes me feel like I\'m going to slide off of the chair, and if it were slick like leather instead of microfiber, I probably would! The seat is also not as large as I expected it to be based on the measurements given; plenty large enough for sitting regularly with feet on the floor (which I can\'t do with this), but I\'d wanted to be able to sit in it cross legged and it\'s definitely not wide enough for that.One more note: you cannot tilt back at all in this chair as most office chairs do. You can only sit up straight and swivel.About the only two positive things I can think of about this chair are that the fabric is super soft, I love that the arms are padded - the arms on my old chair were wood over metal and were very hard and uncomfortable.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 8, 2017', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars At Last, THE perfect exec Office Chair!

This provides abundant support, and is comfortable, sturdy, and wheels glide effortlessly where you want the chair to roll. It is a beautiful color, and makes any office area Pop.No assembly, no issues, the arms are upholstered, too, and must say, I feel so good in this cozy chair. BTW I like reviews when the purchaser includes details about their height, weight, size for furniture pieces as there is, in my opinion, no OSFA (one size fits all) in executive office chairs. I spend hours a day in mine so I need to be completely comfortable all day long, day in, day out. This Serta? I believe the Serta Fairies took my measurements in my sleep, and custom designed this wonderful piece especially for me. I am a tall female, fit, 5\'9"", legs for days, with long arms and the armrests are essential for me.I am in my 40\'s but an accident left me with severe, debilitating neck, lower back & thoracic injuries. I could not find an office chair that looked this good, that ""fit"" me. Then there is the comfort factor. This is THE best investment and I had a $900 chair that was inferior to this gem. I got rid of that one and this is perfect. This is really soothing my neck surgery residuals. For anyone with spinal problems, health issues, this may be helpful to you. My friend stayed here two weeks, said it helped calm her carpal tunnel syndrome nerve pain. She recovered from her left hand carpal tunnel surgery, and will be having her right hand surgery soon.The price is really low for the features, support, design, quality and am delighted after a long, frustrating year of trying out exec chairs, I found my perfect fit.

It's still held together after a year, so no complaints there. I wasn't expecting any kind of support on the cushion, so comfort is pretty okay too. I haven't had any pain issues on my back or otherwise since using it! I think my favorite feature of this chair are the soft armrests. They are very nice, and sit at just the right level, even if they aren't adjustable :>Okay now for the cons :'DAfter maybe three or so months, the chair started squeaking quite a bit. So just be aware that if you have a roomie or s/o who hates squeaky sounds, then maybe go with a different chair (luckily my s/o is totally fine with the noise haha). Its just the sort of thing that happens with cheaper chairs, which is alright if you're on that budget.Secondly, although the microfiber covering feels really nice you need to beware if you live in an area with dry air (like Southern California, for example). I didn't realize it at first, but if you live in a dry climate and have a carpet floor this chair becomes.... scary. Why? Because if you touch any metal surface when you stand to get up out of your chair, you will get a BIG electric shock. I'm 100% serious on this--and it really startled me when it started happening! Sometimes the shocks would get so big, I could actually see light coming from my fingertip. It can be a little painful if you don't remember to discharge the electricity somehow (i.e. I touch the wall to get rid of the static buildup after standing up). I wear socks all the time, so this also factors into the static buildup. I have metal parts in my desk that I use this chair with, so unfortunately shocks are frequent for me. Just something I gotta live with until I get a new chair or a cover I guess!That being said, I'm still fine with purchasing this chair.

Cohen', 'rating': 3, 'content': 'Needed a sturdier chair for my home office, and I personally like the feel of microfiber vs. leather (or fake leather). The chair has very stiff cushioning (which I like for prolonged periods of sitting) and the arm rests are at a reasonable height and width for me (I\'m 6\', 220lbs). The chair offers a decently ergonomic experience albeit it\'s a touch on the tall side even when fully lowered. My 5\'4"" wife said it would be uncomfortable for her to sit in for very long since her legs dangle a bit. Not too much of a problem for me, but the real issue with this chair is that it leans back only a fraction of what it should.The reason for this is two metal tabs that make contact with the back side of the hinge mechanism. There\'s only about a 1/4"" gap in there which doesn\'t allow for very much tilt at all, making the chair somewhat uncomfortable to lean back in. It\'s not even as good as an airline seat IMHO.Ideally, you\'d want your center of mass to be able to rotate to behind the hinge point so that the chair can stay reclined without you having to push back with your feet, and this is not the case in the original, stock form. The fix is to take an oscillating tool with a bi-metal blade (or maybe you could use a jig saw, not sure) and chop those tabs off by another 1/4"". Now the chair leans back a proper amount, and there\'s still no risk of it tipping over (for me, at least). Obviously, this will void the warranty, so do it at your own risk. If you remove anything more than 1/4"", it might induce a tipping over backwards hazard (especially if you\'re larger than me) so you have been warned.I have no idea why they thought the extremely minimal amount of tilt was a good thing, or maybe it has to do with how far back the base is mounted to the seat, since it seems like the tilt mechanism is a standard part used in many different chairs. It remains to be seen if the chair holds up over time, but for now, after modification, it\'s quite comfy and I\'m looking forward to using it for a long while.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States March 19, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Wonderful Office Chair', 'author': 'casey coil', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Bought for my child that sits in it everyday to play games with his friends.

Back then, it was also made by Serta, and it was like sitting on a cloud, on that awesome microfiber upholstery. Though... No longer.Several years back that chair was great. It felt like I was sitting on a Serta mattress. Sure, it had a problem with the lifter/cylinder, where it would not keep the height of the chair and would slowly deflate. But, I had already owned the chair for like 3 - 4 years already at that point, and I feel I got good use out of it. I tried replacing the cylinder, but it was nigh impossible to remove the cylinder from the wheel base, so in the trash it went.Little over a year ago, I bought this chair again, because I really loved how comfortable it was. But, something changed in the seat design that seriously reduced how comfy it is. It feels hard, and prolonged periods of sitting are not recommended in this chair.It then also reminded me, of the forward portion of the arm rest that attaches to the seat, how it would dig into my thighs. I\'m not a super big guy, sure I\'m 6\'2"", and 235lbs, but it did make me remember how the arm rests weren\'t in the greatest positions for thick thighs.Fast forward to a couple of weeks ago... cylinder appears to leaking again, or just not staying where it\'s supposed to be. If I sit in the chair, I can expect the chair to slowly descend again... guess that part of the chair never got addressed either.Very sad... as I really used to think highly of this chair, and even with the thigh-issue, I thought it was still a super comfy chair... But, considering that the cylinder/lifter issue now seems like it\'s just a thing for this chair, and the fact that the upholstery just isn\'t the same anymore... very sad.I don\'t recommend getting this chair if you work from home, or sit in your office chair a lot. It used to be very comfortable, the seat... but with all these other chronic issues, I just can\'t recommend this chair.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 30, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Serta office chair', 'author': 'Nancy White', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Love it.

This chair has really great lower back support, and the majority of the stars in the review can be attributed to this feature. The mesh back is also nice during the hot days, as it doesn't block the flow of air from the fan. The assembly was fairly straight foward, with mostly clear instructions and no need for extra tools, although I do think they could've put in there to avoid tightening the screws on the arms fully until the seat was also screwed in. It's not hard to figure out after the fact, since you quickly come to the realization the seat won't fit without a little give from the arms, but it's annoying to have to go back and loosen something you just thought you finished. Still, assembly only took me about 20 minutes and that was with me pacing myself, which isn't bad at all.Not good, but not horrible feature: the seat. It's really firm and I don't think it's ergonomic at all, unlike the back. On one hand, that's good because it means it won't flatten out like some of the more cushy seats tend to do over time, but, on the other hand, it means it's not that comfortable to begin with. Also, the meshy lining over the seat feels pretty rough on the skin and leaves imprints, which also isn't that comfortable.The bad: the armrests. I'm a petite woman who finds most desk chair armrests to be too high and, this, unfortunately, went all the way to the other side of the problem and is too low. I found myself hunching over to use the armrests all the time, which is a killer on the upper back and shoulders and is bad for posture. I can't imagine how it must be for taller people to sit in this chair. I considered returning the chair simply because of the armrest issue, but ultimately decided to keep it because the thought of disassembling it and dragging the box to return it was worse than the thought of keeping it. What I ended up doing was buying a pair of chair armrest pads that velcro on, and that made up for the little bit of height the arms needed, but it did turn this $50 purchase to a $70 purchase, so not as cheap as I thought at first."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States June 18, 2017', 'is_verified': True}]"

The seat pad is not super squishy but is supportive and I like that it's contoured, it's not just a flat surface. Lower back support is good. Easy to put together. The two reasons I decided to try this chair is because it came in various colors (I got the blue) and had arm rests that you can lift up and out of the way if you want to move in close to the desk. I have not had any issues sliding off the seat like others have mentioned. It has a nice range of height adjustment. It does recline and also has a recline lock and tension adjustment. Not sure why others have said it doesn't recline?? Maybe the put the base on backwards??However it's not perfect but with a couple of add-on's it's very close. I added rollerblade style wheels which I ordered on Amazon to prevent any floor scratching issues on my wood laminate flooring. Also the fabric is a little itchy for lack of a better term. But the only place it bothered me was on my elbows. I often rest the point of my elbows on the arm rest and the fabric is very irritating over time. So I ordered arm chair pads on Amazon which should solve that issue. Even with the add on's it's still a good price. I guess very few chairs will be perfect but for the price this is a good chair.

The shipping weight is a little over 44lbs. The box is very heavy duty and everything was packed well. Each component is individually wrapped in bubble wrap and everything was in perfect condition. The primary support mechanism (the part under the seat that controls everything) is very well built and is much thicker steel than what my old office chair (a big box office store name brand chair). The chair is absolutely much sturdier and well built than my old chair. The weight difference alone is significant.The chair assembles easily, although the instructions aren't entirely clear on how a few things go together. Such as how to mount the main support bracket to the seat bottom. Each piece has an arrow sticker- you just need to make sure the arrows are both pointing in the same direction. But the instructions don't mention that. I was able to get it fully assembled in about 20 minutes. They do provide an M5 Allen wrench. However, this wrench is very low quality steel and stripped out about 4 bolts in to the assembly. So just grab your own tools from the start. They give you one extra bolt of each size and all of them have blue threadlocker applied.The chair is very comfortable and supportive. If anything I wish there was a way to adjust the lumbar support. My old executive style office chair had no lumbar support at all so I'm just not used to it. This chair leans back much further than my old chair. Even so, I had no concern about flipping backwards due to the large caster base. The casters have a slight rubber feel, not just hard plastic. This is nice but it means it doesn't roll as easy as my old chair. Which, honestly, is a good thing as my old chair would often roll away from my desk far too easily.I also like that the arm wrests can fold up and out of the way. This let's me fully push the chair up under my desk when I'm not using it and not have the arm wrests hit the keyboard tray.It then includes a bracket mounted on the chair back that you can hang your jacket or other items on. That's handier than you might think.Overall I am very happy with this chair. Especially with how well built it is. I'm not concerned about the support mechanism cracking or bending like other chairs I've owned have done.I really have no real negatives other than with the Allen wrench that was provided (which is really a non-issue).

Another gripe I have against this chair is the size and support. So it's got a very short seating platform to hold the thighs, I constantly have to find small step stools to rest my foot on to relieve my thighs. Also the back support is lacking since the chair's back rim is very short in height. Anyway, overall, this is not really an office chair that an adult can sit for a long while at the office.

The L-shaped allen wrench (provided) was impossible to keep straight alignment while turning during initiation of thread engagement. Had to use my own T-handled wrench and replacement of several screws with self-threading tapered anchor screws that did not require perfect straight alignment to engage. Caster wheels were mediocre and hard surfaced making rolling on hard surface, or plush carpet noisy and stiff. I chose to replace them with set of 2"" dual wheel — Omyoffice Heavy-Duty Chair Wheels Support 2200lbs, Mute Polyurethane-Rubber Chair Casters for Hardwood Floors and Carpet — (See separate Review).

This review, however, is not about the chair per se; it is to acknowledge the prompt and valuable help given to me by the company's customer service department. I bought this chair a little over a year ago and had no basic problems with it until quite recently, when the mechanism for raising and lowering the seat failed. I like a high perch when I work at my desk, and I suddenly found my seat sinking all the way down shortly after I raised it. My weight is well below the load-bearing limit of the chair, so I knew that there had to be a fault in the piston or the locking mechanism. I was aware that I was just outside the one-year warrantee period and that I could not expect to return the chair or claim replacement parts. But I'm relatively handy and I enjoy tinkering with things if they need fine-tuning or fixing, so I contacted Kerdom and asked if someone might help me to repair the chair on my own. I knew it was a crapshoot and that Kerdom had no formal obligation to help me other than reinforcing customer goodwill. Nonetheless, I got a very quick response to my inquiry from customer service and, within a few days, an email saying that they would send me a new part to replace the deflective one. Again, they did not have to do this and I was already planning a clunky but functional workaround if they decided not to pitch in and help. Generally speaking, I have had few products purchased on Amazon fail on me. But I've read enough reviews here to realize that even the best of products sometimes slip through quality control and go out with defective parts. I haven't yet gotten out my tools to replace the old elevating mechanism with the new one, but I'm pretty confident, given the relative rarity of product failures I've experienced, that the re-fitted chair will work fine. (Should it not, I will certainly revisit this review.) But I would be remiss if I did not recognize, before all else, the support given me by Kerdom's customer service personnel, who went beyond what they were obliged to do to help me restore my desk chair to full functionality."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 27, 2023', 'is_verified': True}]"

However it requires such great force to get the two pieces into alignment that I might go so far as to advise against this purchase unless you have a stout adult to assist you -- one person to force the seat into alignment and the other to fasten the screws. I did assemble it by myself, but the effort was so strenuous that I soaked two shirts with perspiration. I was exhausted after getting it together.You will also need a hefty rubber mallet to pound in the casters. I don't think there's a way to insert them without strong pounding. Even with a rubber mallet, cover the base with scrap cardboard before striking it. Be prepared to pound hard; if you strike it hard enough from above with the wheels on the floor and ALIGNED PROPERLY, you can get the caster to seat fully with a single wallop.The screws come with Lock-Tite preapplied to lessen the chance of anything coming loose. That's a nice touch, and suggests that quality was important to the manufacturer.The cardboard carton was the very cheap Chinese crap that tears easily. It was punctured in a couple of places during shipping, but the product was not damaged.Assembly was easy except for attaching the seat to the back. Seating the casters was challenging, but that's to be expected with every assembly-required office chair.After assembly, the chair is pretty comfortable, but I procured an auxiliary cushion to place on the seat simply because I've found that necessary with all the office chairs I've used. Some people will find the arms too close together, but they're OK for me, and they do rotate up and out of the way. Other than that, they're not adjustable -- one height must fit all.

As far as looks, this chair looks very sleek in my office and fits well under my desk (which I also bought on amazon). Also, I like how high the back is on the chair (I am 5\'10""), and the lever to raise the seat works well. Unfortunately, those are the only three positive things I have to say about this chair.First off, the ""butt"" part of the chair where you sit down wore down extremely fast, literally within weeks (but was very padded at all to begin with). Because of the lack of support (especially towards the back of the seat), it causes a lot of lower back/tail bone pain, and I have had to supplement by sitting on a towel/pillow which shouldn\'t be the case after spending almost 150$ on a chair so recently. I think it\'s important to mention- I have no history of back problems so this is a serious cause for concern.Next, one of the biggest selling points of this chair is that the flip-up arms. Unfortunately, if you actually use this feature to store your chair under your desk at the end of the day, you will notice the poor construction of the arms and that the joints of the arms wear down very quickly. After 2 months of use, the right arm is extremely loose, won\'t stay upright, and there is no way to tighten it.Next, the chair claims to offer ergonomic back support, but the mesh on the back of the seat is not tightly attached and has way too much give, so the plastic ""back supports"" in the back do not actually create any support.Overall, very disappointed in this chair, and am now starting to believe that there are a lot of fake positive reviews on this page.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 13, 2020', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': ""5.0 out of 5 stars Lumbar support just for show, but for the price, it's pretty great"", 'author': 'Avi Greengart', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Biggest positive: durability and tremendous value. My son bought himself one of these for college and two years later it\'s still holding up, so when my daughter needed a chair, it seemed like a no brainer to get her one, too. This is a basic task chair, not a pricey ergonomic wonder. I have a Steelcase Leap that\'s now 12 years old, cost $1000 when new, and saved my back. It\'s worth every penny. But for a student using it 1 - 3 hours per day, something like that is overkill; this chair is perfect for 1/10th the cost.Biggest surprise: Hbada designed the chair for very easy construction. The instructions are minimal but everything is well labeled and mostly created in such a way that the only way to screw it together is the correct one. With a power tool it took me less than 10 minutes to assemble, but you can use the included hex driver if you don\'t have a drill and the right bit and it should still be fairly quick.Biggest negative: the lumber support looks good but it\'s just for show -- it doesn\'t provide any meaningful support. If you have serious back problems, well, you need a more expensive chair.Size note: Fits most people, not great for extremes, especially people above 6\' with long legs. My son is 5\' 11"" and it fits him perfectly at the higher settings. My daughter is 5\' 4"", and at its lowest position her feet are flat on the floor without shoes on.

I hoped that the Hbada Ergonomic Desk Chair would be the solution, but it is not.After reading a review on budget office chairs I purchased an Alera 22.8in Manager\'s Chair. However, the side-mounted arms did not give me the storage flexibility I was seeking. My wife took possession of that chair and she is very happy with it. It is EXTREMELY more comfortable and stable than the Hbada for about the same price.My biggest complaint with the Hbada is the positioning of the flip-up arms. As you can see in the photos, the way they are assembled to the chair back has the forward ends angled inward. This causes the tips to have only 16-3/8"" of clearance. When I tried to sit with the arms in the lowered position, one of the arms caught the front pocket of my pants and caused a small tear. When I sit completely against the chair back, it doesn\'t necessarily interfere with movement, but I still feel somewhat ""restrained"" by the arms being so close. I\'ve never previously felt this with any other chair with side arms.Also, it doesn\'t feel very stable. I can rock from side to side about 1 inch from where the chair base sits on the gas cylinder. I have never previously felt this on any other lift chair.The chair cushion is OK, but not very thick. The Alerea chair cushion is more than twice as thick and much more comfortable. I haven\'t yet put enough hours sitting on it to see how it holds up.Overall, I am very disappointed with the design and quality of this chair. I would recommend looking for an alternative. I would return it, but I already threw away the shipping box.I am actively looking for a different chair with flip-up arms.

This chair has proven to be a valuable addition to my office setup, providing comfort and functionality that have significantly enhanced my daily work experience.One of the chair's standout features is its sturdiness. The build quality is excellent, giving me confidence in its durability and stability during long hours of use. This aspect is crucial for anyone looking for a long-term office chair investment.The ergonomic design of the chair also deserves praise. The adjustable lumbar support and tilt function allow for a customized seating experience, catering to the unique needs of my posture and sitting preferences. This has been a game-changer in terms of comfort during prolonged periods of sitting.The breathable mesh on the chair is another positive, ensuring that I remain cool and comfortable, even during extended work sessions. This feature is particularly appreciated during warmer days when traditional chairs can become uncomfortably warm.However, there is a minor drawback that I noticed after purchasing: the armrest height is not adjustable. This is likely due to the flip-up design of the armrests, which is a feature I enjoy for its space-saving benefits. Unfortunately, I overlooked this detail when making my purchase. Despite this, the armrests are comfortable and well-positioned for my use.In conclusion, except for the non-adjustable armrest height, this Hbada office chair meets all my expectations for an ergonomic desk chair. It's sturdy, comfortable, and has a range of adjustable features that contribute to an optimal seating experience.

Not the best but not the worse chair I’ve had. Overall, I like the chair. Can’t complain too much at this price point. I was more concerned that the materials will feel cheap, like the plastic but it’s pretty sturdy. It’s decently comfortable if you sit properly.-=-=-=-=-=-=-Here is an in-depth review:— Seat cushion (2/5 stars):The seat cushion isn’t great — unless you sit properly at all times, any weird sitting position will be uncomfortable (i.e if you sit on your legs). If you happen to seat near the middle or front end of the chair and you usually have tailbone pain, you’ll likely get it with this chair. After receiving the chair, within an hour of use, the foam is already dented and does not fully return to its original form. After a few days, I can feel the unevenness on the seat, even after several hours of not using it. Pretty sure it’s permanent now. I’ve purchased a seat cushion to combat this issue. For comparison, I’m 150lb, 5’10”. The seat cushion is about 1.5"" thick, you can easily feel the base plate.— Arms (4/5 stars):It was solid and worked perfectly when I first used it. However, due to the arm mechanism, the nut holding the arm in place can get loose if you move the arm up and down often. I found this happen more with one side than the other. Took the arm off and tighten the nut but that only fixed the issue temporarily. After moving the arm a few times, the nut got loose again causing the arm to just fall down and wobble.IF YOU ARE HAVING THIS ISSUE — here’s a fix I\'ve found to worked for me. Go to your local hardware store and find a pack of flat washers and locking washers (washers with uneven/bent ends). The flat washer should be no larger than 7/8” (outer diameter). Internal diameter of the washer should be 3/8”. Remove the arm from the chair and remove the nut. Keep the existing flat washer in place and place a locking washer on top and a new flat washer after. Place the nut back and hand tighten snug. The order should be Flat Washer > Locking Washer > Flat Washer > Hex Nut on the arm’s through-bolt. I’m able to move the arm repeatedly now without it ever getting loose or wobbly.The manufacturer is however aware of this issue and is fixing it as far as I know. So please contact them if you are having this issue if you find that my fix isn’t working.Once my issue was fixed, I’ve find that the arm is pretty solid. The mechanism that allows the arm to rotate is limited by the plastic used to make the chair (if you disassemble the arm, you’ll see what I mean). The plastic is pretty solid, but I wouldn’t put my entire weight on the arm. Who knows, maybe it’s capable of supporting it but I don’t want to risk it.— Mesh Back / Lumbar Support (4/5 stars):There’s not much to complain about for me. It’s comfortable when you have your back against it. But I didn’t notice anything that stood out to me. The lumbar support is pretty non-existent, I don’t even feel it. So if you really need lumbar support, this might not be the best chair for you.— Hydraulic Cylinder (5/5 stars):So far (within a week of use), I haven’t had any issue with it. The chair will very slightly compress when you sit on it, but nothing significant. But I know that I’ll likely won’t see any issue until later down the line. So I’ll try to update this after more use.— Customer Support (5/5 stars):Prior to fixing the arm myself, I contacted them about it and they were pretty fast at responding (within a few hours). Pretty professional and was diligent in making sure my issue was resolved by offering a couple of solutions. So if you do happen to have any issue with your chair, I wouldn’t hesitate contacting them to see how they will help.Would I recommend this or purchase it again at this price point ($139.99)? Yes.________________________6 Month Review (over 1000 hrs of use):With the arm fixed I proposed above, it’s been flawless. No issues with it at all, no wiggle and not lose. That was one the biggest things I feared. Most chairs I bought, it ended up wiggling a lot after a while and couldn’t hold itself up anymore. So glad this one hasn’t had this issue yet.Hydraulic cylinder still works great. No squeaks either when reclining back and forth or swiveling.Still happy with this chair! Would still recommend it.________________________8 Month Update:Typical usage. Chair is starting to creek and make a bit of noise when you rock back and forth. The back mesh is a bit loose now but nothing too bad. Hydraulics still performing as before.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States July 23, 2020', 'is_verified': True}]"

It offers comfort and support for long workdays, making it an excellent choice for anyone working from home. However, while it excels in many aspects, some minor issues are worth noting.First and foremost, the comfort level of this chair is exceptional. I spend long hours working from home, and this chair has been a game-changer in terms of providing a comfortable seating experience. The cushion is both supportive and breathable, which is a crucial feature for those like me who often find themselves sitting for extended periods. The mesh backrest is a fantastic addition; it ensures proper ventilation and keeps me cool throughout the day.One of the standout features of this chair is its ergonomic design, particularly the lumbar support. It provides the necessary lower back support, reducing strain and promoting better posture. This feature has been a significant relief during my work hours, and I appreciate the thought put into the chair's design.However, there are a couple of areas where the chair falls slightly short. The roller legs or feet could have been extended further outward for added stability. Occasionally, when rolling the chair forward, especially when pulling it with the desk, there's a feeling that it might tip forward. While this doesn't happen frequently, it's worth mentioning as it can be a minor inconvenience.Another issue is with the plastic decorative cover on the back of the chair. It fell off twice during use, and unfortunately, it broke the second time it fell. While this is fine. A simple adhesive or more secure attachment for this cover could prevent such occurrences.Despite these minor hiccups, I must emphasize that I still love this chair. In fact, I was so satisfied with it that I ended up purchasing a second one for my wife. The overall comfort and support it provides outweigh these minor issues.

Its breathable cushion, lumbar support, and mesh backrest contribute to a positive ergonomic experience.

Sure, assembly isn't as easy and putting two Legos together, but if you seriously had issues assembling this maybe you shouldn't be assembling furniture. The bolts DO NOT go into slots, but they pass THROUGH slots so you can adjust the depth of the bottom cushion slightly. Anyone with shorter legs should appreciate that.The only thing I found slightly wonky is that the headrest itself must remain inserted into it's bracket before you attach the bottom half hanger that clamps it to the chairback. If you try to slide it up and down before it's mounted it will push the locking tabs out of the tube, but if you're even basically mechanically inclined you can easily put them back in in seconds.As for the chair itself my biggest concern was the stability of the armrests as these pillar mount style ones are notorious for being wobbly. Thankfully, these ones aren't and I'm assuming it's due to the very stout mounting system that wraps under the bottom. There's a slight amount of movement due to the adjustable height but nowhere near enough that it's distracting. I've seen none better and many that were FAR worse. Height comes up well above where I would want it so I can only assume anyone complaining about the low armrests either don't know how to raise them or they're extraordinarily tall which neither is the chair's fault. (I will never understand why people that are very tall or overweight magically expect all seating to accommodate them.)The mesh is nice and cool and the adjustable lumbar makes it easy to put it exactly where you need it for your height.

But the 3 holes are now slots and this is not entirely obvious at first. See attached pics. I show how the actual mechanism looks different from the manual, and how to align the slots.In addition, for the hanger, the manual says to remove 2 screws from the headrest. Those 2 screws are actually on the hanger, which also serves as the mount for the headrest. This also means you cannot mount the headrest without mounting the hanger. Based on other review I read here and elsewhere, this appears to be a recent change to address the difficulty in figuring out how to attach the hanger.Overall I am pleased but I feel like they could have taken the time to update the manual.

Some reviews have noted the distance between the lumbar support and the mesh back as being too great, but the mesh itself has offered me great support, so I've not really had to fiddle with this. 2) I bought this because the seat and back are both mesh, hoping it would be cooler with more airflow -- and it is; wooden seats and cushioned seats I've used have made me noticeably hotter as the day went on. This chair doesn't have that issue. Exactly why I bought it.CON: 1) Not much of a negative, but because the seat is mesh and can't sit up higher than the edges of the frame the mesh is attached to, the seat frame can sometimes feel a bit more present pressing against the outsides of your thighs. (A cushion extends above the seat frame sides and doesn't exhibit this.) It's not bad, but occasionally I notice it. Not enough to drop my rating to a 4 star.UPDATE: Several months later, the seat wobbles side to side in the base. Feels unsteady. Will update again if it becomes a bigger problem.UPDATE 2: 2.5 years later, the ring in the base where the piston sits has cracked, causing the seat to wobble significantly more from side to side, like to the point where you wonder if you'll fall over in the middle of using it. This is because the housing where the piston rests is plastic. The stated seat weight capacity was not exceeded.

It fits my 5\'5"" spouse perfectly, and she loves it, but I\'m 6\'1"" and it doesn\'t work so well for me. When it doesn\'t work there is very little that can be adjusted. Here\'s my breakdown of the components.SEAT - The seat spans an impressive 20 inches, although the lumbar mechanism restricts you from using all of its space. It affords reasonable but not exceptional cushioning. The pneumatic lift works great. For me, I would like it to lift at least 1/2 to 3/4 inches higher, but for my spouse, it\'s just right.BACK - My spouse loves the lumbar support, it fits her body perfectly, and she finds it very comfortable. I feel the large lumbar support curve doesn\'t work for me. It\'s very large and can\'t really be adjusted. Although the product says, ""adjustable lumbar support,"" the only modification I can make is by loosening or tightening the springs. I can\'t remove it or move it up or down. For me, it pushes my spine too far forward.For me, the inability to tilt the chair and lean backward with it comes across as a flaw. However, my spouse doesn\'t use that feature in a chair and doesn\'t mind its absence.ARMS - The armrests are quite comfortable. However, the arms cannot be adjusted inwardly or outwardly, nor can they be moved up or down. I can only move the armrests upward out of the way if I don\'t want to use them.HEAD - The head adjustment is very good. It can move up or down several inches, and the position of the headrest does create an effective cushion when leaning into it. Here, it fits me perfectly on the top setting, but my spouse would like it to move a bit lower than its lowest setting.WHEELS - The wheels work very well, they glide with a bit of effort, which is great.INSTALLATION It\'s a standard chair installation, just take note that the screws are all marked with the same ""M6"" for some reason, so you have to differentiate them by their length.I should mention that I used a chair with a similar design for 17 years, so if this fits and proves equally durable, it would be a great value.I\'m giving it 5 stars because it works for the right person.

If you can survive without those two adjustments, then you should consider this Noblewell office chair.This chair is good for sitting up straight with. It's reasonably sturdy, and has held up for a month's use approximately with no signs of giving up the ghost. It also reclines, and has a headrest, so if you can nap in a reclining office chair it might help you with some Z's.What it WON'T do is win you any envy, or a raise. It's just a chair with a brand that sounds like a Chinese guy took a cool-sounding word in Chinese and ran it through Google translate. In fact, that is most likely where this brand name came from. Rest assured that it is the same chair being sold by 5-10 other oddly-named corporations based in China.Back to functionality though. This chair will not allow you to adjust the angle of recline and lock it into place. You have two options: kingly posture or springy recliner. That is unfortunate for me, because I'm not kingly and sometimes I don't feel like napping. However, it very clearly advertises that it is lacking said feature, so how could I dock it points for not having a feature it professes not to have? If you want that feature, you will need to pay extra to get a better chair. Your call. If you want kingly posture + napping, this is the chair for you.I do like that the arms are height-adjustable, unlike chairs from 1918.Would I buy it again? For the price, I don't think I'd find anything better. However, I do like my office chair at home better, and I probably paid less for that one 8-10 years ago than I did for this one. That one will lock in at any angle of reclining, and also has an angle-adjustable seat (as shown in the picture).

Even for that size, one problem with such gaming chairs is that the wings on the seat can be too close together and squish the legs and thighs. But not on this chair.The wings are at an angle flatter than most, so it opens up more and they don\'t stick up as high. Which is a big plus and no problem there for the legs and thighs.Paddings around the whole chair can be thicker but adequate.The thing that this doesn\'t get 5 stars is because when sitting, the center of gravity of the chair automatically tilt back slightly with no assertion on the seater\'s part to recline. Even though it moves barely half an inch or so with no pushing, it\'s distracting. It migh not bother others but we prefer the chair to remain still as we sit straight, since we use it for working at the desk more than gaming.

I’ve owned this chair for going on nine months, and so far it has held up in every way, unlike my last chair which started off great, then hit the fan.I’ll be doing pro’s and cons and explain my overall rating down below, but some details I would like to provide first:I did a lot of research before i purchased this chair. One of my primary complaints about all the office chairs i’ve ever had are:1. The seating isn’t comfortable for long periods of time.2. The seating isn’t wide enough for someone like me who is 6’3 and has a stomach.3. After a while, every time I lean back, they all start tilting to the right, no matter what I do.I don’t purchase things for myself often, so I wanted to make sure that I was spending my money on something that was quality made, and would last more then a year (unlike my last chair). Plus, as a young homeowner who doesn’t have a lot of extra cash, $200-300 is a fairly large purchase for me.Let me preface this by saying that I spend a lot of time in my chair. When I purchased this, I worked fully remote full time (40H/Week), and now I am on a hybrid schedule, so I still spend at least (24h/Week) in my chair. My home office is also my music room, man cave and where I go to work on my personal projects, so a lot of time is spent in there.I want to start off with the things I DON’T like about this chair first, and then i’ll move into the Pros.THE CONS:1. The Arms don’t adjust, they are what keeps the backrest and base (of the chair) together. This probably isn’t a huge issue for most people, but as someone who plays guitar/bass, it would be nice to have the option to lower the arms, so my guitar isn’t hitting them.2. When it arrived, it had that god awful chemical smell that fake leather gets. The smell went away after about 3 weeks, but it was bad at first.3. It is comfortable, but after about 6 hours, my back will start to ache a bit, this is probably more of a “me” problem than the chair, but figured id mention it.4. The wheels are kinda crap, not a huge deal, but if you have one chair for multiple desk/workstations, I would recommend upgrading the wheels when you purchase it. Again, not a huge deal, but worth mentioning.5. It is a very large chair, it doesn’t fit under my desk unless I lower it. If you have a small office or your office is in a tight space, this may not work well for you.THE PRO’S:1. The seat itself is very comfortable. It feels similar to like sitting on the couch rather than a desk chair, which I love.2. The seat is also wide enough to fit me comfortably, the arms aren’t rubbing against my sides or anything like that, which again, huge win.3. It is STURDY. This chair is built very well, I feel comfortable leaning all they way back on it, which I can’t say for most chairs. If you plop into your seat every time, this may not be the case, but if you take care of it, it will last a long time.4. So far, it doesn’t have that annoying right lean problem that all my other chairs have had, so thats another win in my book.5. The height adjustment is perfect, especially for a tall person. Like I mentioned before, i’m 6’3, and this chair at its tallest setting is perfect for me. If I lean back, my feet even come off the ground (slightly). Most chairs I sit in, this is not the case. Most of them start slowly going down during the day, but I haven’t had that issue with this one.All in all, I believe four stars is a fair rating for this chair, maybe even a 4.5. Other than the arms not being adjustable, the terrible wheels and the awful smell that ultimately went away, this chair does its job and does it well. I would definitely consider this chair again in the future, and I would recommend it to others like myself. You’re getting a great chair, for a fairly reasonable price.

It took a lot to upset me, and this product and company crossed that line. The chair is advertised as a Big & Tall chair with a 400lb. Capacity. I\'m 6.4"", and I weigh 220lbs.The chair came packaged reasonably well, albeit the delivery date was delayed twice. Assembly was straightforward and easy. That\'s about all I can say positively about this chair. The chair is uncomfortable. When you sit in the chair, it feels as if you are about to be slung forward, so you have to use your feet to brace yourself against the floor. This is with the spring tensioner all the way off. Likewise, the seat is not oversized. If anything, it\'s smaller than a normal seat. I know because I measured and compared it to other chairs in my office. The metal base of the chair is also smaller than the seat. Why does this matter? If you lean too much in one direction or the other, like to reach for a desk drawer or mail on your desktop, the chair tips in that direction. When you attempt to lean back in the chair, the tilt stops in a very unusual position that is extremely uncomfortable. I think if I had to sum it up, if you want to get an isometric exercise in, then this chair is the chair to get, because your legs and low back will be aching by the end of an hour if you can last that long.But wait, there\'s more. Remember, I mentioned that assembly was straightforward and easy? I failed to mention the bolts don\'t stay put. The bolts back out and fall to the floor. I sincerely feel like this chair is a gimmick chair that was destined for a comedy show and somehow managed to arrive at my office. Lastly, this isn\'t a product that an unhappy purchaser can click return or refund on. Nope, you have to go to the company\'s customer support website. Regardless of how many times you call their support number, you will get an answering machine. Not voice mail, but an old-fashioned answering machine that sometimes says the machine is full and can\'t accept more messages. The same applies to email. Send them an email or complete their customer service form, and it must just go off into space because you never receive confirmation or do you ever receive a reply. There is no customer service. I did my due diligence and looked this company up online and discovered it is a one-bay warehouse at the back of a dilapidated industrial park with a for sale sign on the door.So do yourself a favor and spend your money elsewhere because I can guarantee you won\'t be happy with your experience with this product. Oh and if you are questioning whether or not I just got a lemon, I\'ll admit, I bought 2 of these chairs and both have the same issues.

So, I ordered this chair hoping that the higher weight rating (400lbs) would take care of the gas lift problem. I\'m about 5\' 10"" and about 245lbs. However, at the lowest setting with my boots on, my feet just touch the floor. And at that, my back isn\'t firmly enough against the chair-back to get the proper back support. I\'ll have to use a lumbar pillow but that\'s not that big of a deal. The seat of the chair is also much wider than a standard office chair but that\'s OK. I think it\'ll just take some getting-used-to. Leaning back is also almost impossible for me because it is very stiff. Again, I believe it\'s because this chair is made for a person much heavier and taller than I am.I\'m not blaming the chair because it\'s obviously built for a big and tall person. In fact, I would recommend this chair if you are bigger and taller than I am. On the plus side, I\'ll never have to worry about the gas lift going bad because the only way I can use this chair is to have it bottomed-out on the lowest possible setting for height. The only other thing: How well will the bonded ""leather"" hold up? (I hate that the word ""leather"" is used in descriptions when it is a man-made material). At least, in the description for this chair, they describe it as ""faux leather"" (kudos for the honesty).

The entire seat back reclines but the lumbar support itself does not adjust for depth. I wish it did because it does not come forward quite enough to fully support my lumbar but it may be fine for everybody else. I have a fairly pronounced arch in my back and have had lower back surgery so I need more support than most people might. I also have a very long tailbone that has been been giving me a lot of problems when I sit for the last few years. This chair angles down in the back and if I scoot back as far as possible, I am able to sit without having my tailbone touch the chair with a lot of pressure which has been a big relief and one of the goals I was hoping to accomplish. I did assemble it per the instructions but after sitting in it I decided to turn the armrests backwards as they were too far forward for me when installed as instructed.

You can also adjust the armrest height if needed. The height adjustment of the chair also allows me to sit comfortably without my legs or knees, being uncomfortable, and the back also has a support adjustment that’s great. this is also the first office chair I’ve ever had that I felt completely secure, and I could lean back, move around and everything else without worrying if I was gonna dump myself in the floor on accident.

The more I researched the more I realized I couldn'tfind something of quality and all of that for anything less than $300.

Do not buy.', 'author': 'Shoop-T', 'rating': 1, 'content': 'I just had to write in. The chair was easy to assemble and seems to be sturdy, but man, the back rest is terribly designed. The massager juts out in the lower back area and so it’s like you are reclining onto two hard plastic pieces. I thought at first it had to be me, but once I adjusted the massager up and down a few times I realized that it was just bad design. I am frankly surprised not to see this mentioned in the reviews. I contacted the seller about this and they suggested I reposition the massager — but I told them I already tried this — up or down, it’s still hard plastic. They also said I can remove the massager with a screwdriver, which frankly seems like BS — the massager is built into the one-piece back, right behind the mesh covering — I would need a 1 inch screwdriver to even reach those screws. They sent me a return label, but it would be such a hassle to disassemble, box up and get to UPS, that I decided to hang onto it and maybe use a screwdriver through the mesh (ripping small holes) to remove the massager.My back hurts, my legs go numb when sitting in the chair.

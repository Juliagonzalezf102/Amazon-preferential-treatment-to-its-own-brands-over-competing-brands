I was honestly expecting at least a few to break but was very pleasantly surprised when none did.

I bought some. This is my second order, so that tells you I\'m good with this product. Though the body of the hanger is still plastic (albeit covered with cloth), the metal hook is very sturdy compared to the plastic hangers. When the plastic hangers would break, it was usually the hook that would break off. After probably over a year of use on the original order, I do not recall having any of these hangers break.The other great positive is that all the slippery fabric items that slip off plastic hangers stay put on this hanger.When a number of our plastic hangers broke, I made this second order for enough hangers to replace all the plastic ones if we happened to want to do so. This leads to the one potential detractor for some customers. I personally felt we could get rid of the plastic hangers and be done with them, but I was told not to discard them. The velvety covering does make it harder to just slip something off the hanger. While I tend to not care about this, some family members do not really want to use these velvety hangers for clothing that doesn\'t need the velvet to stay on the hanger. I think this is mostly an issue when the clothes hang on a fairly high rod where a shorter person might not be as able to lift the clothing off the hanger. This is the only reason for the 4 versus 5 rating. If only I was using them, it would be a straight up 5, but since some family members have this issue, its only right to pass that along in the review.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 4, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Good Hangers', 'author': 'Kay Babi', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I loved these hangers, my clothes do not slip off of these and they are really sturdy.

It requires one apiece.2.) If you swivel too much in one direction (righty tightly, lefty loosey), then the top falls off. ---- BUT THIS IS EASILY REMEDIED!!3.)

Having decided on the thin plastic space-saving style for my regular hangers (can't stand the velvet/flocked hangers), I came across these with the S-shape but was originally hesitant to purchase this brand simply due to the lower weight capacity shown in the listing, and thought the other brand with a higher weight limit (and no S-shape) would be sturdier, so decided to try both. In comparing the two hangers side by side in person, I see no difference in material or thickness between the brands, and even the hooks have the same exact markings. In fact, the only difference I can see, besides the S-shape, is the Bagail hangers have the additional non-slip pads which worked well for me because while I wanted to try the S-shape, my priority was having all my hangers in black for consistency. Because they are well made I was able to get thin hangers with the S-shape without compromising on sturdiness, so Mama is a happy camper!What I love about these hangers:1) Came securely packaged; 2) Quality is top-notch - all hangers hung evenly, there were no scratches, breaks, or flaws, color was consistent, and they were clean (the other brand had some smears of unknown substance); 3) DOUBLED my closet space with this thin design; 4) The S-shape neck is the most brilliant and useful idea! Now I can easily hang high neck and turtleneck tops without having to slide the hanger in place from below; 5) The hooks are not free-swinging so the hangers stay straight in the closet, but they are easily rotated when you choose to rotate them; 6) They are not flocked and will not stain clothes; 7) The rubberized pads are truly non-slip yet you can still easily remove the article of clothing at will (I turned a hanger 90 degrees and my satiny blouse did not budge!); 8) Versatile for closet or laundry - almost any variety of wet or dry clothes can be hung with the cami hooks, pants bar, and tie bar; 9) Sturdy - they easily hold my heaviest jeans without signs of stress or bowing. (I do still use wood hangers for blazers, jackets, and coats to retain shoulder shape.) 10) They come in black to match my new wood and skirt hangers!No downsides but a couple things to note: You will still want a different type of hanger for heavier items and coats not so much because these hangers can't hold them, but more to retain shape. I do own several heavy weight tops that weigh over 1.5 lbs each and while this hanger was not bending, the combination of the weight and type of material of one did leave a thin crease across the shoulders, so these tops went on wood hangers, too. Also, the other thin hanger I tried (and returned) had a 1/2 inch taller opening for pants due to not having the S-shape. This does not bother me, but thought it would be useful to know in case you are planning on hanging many pairs of thick pants.I can't speak to how they work with sweaters as I fold them.

They just aren’t designed for heavy lifting. At least, not the ones I’ve come across. They're great for keeping clothes from sliding off and have notches for small straps. Perfect for dresses and uniquely styled sleeveless apparel. Also, they’re made to look good, sleek and classy and to give your closet an organized appearance (even if it isn’t so much:). Their thin design helps to cram more clothes on a rack while still keeping it neat.Anyway, these particular HOUSE DAY hangers are an excellent value at 50 under 20$ (at the time of my order). They are also the most durable ones I’ve used; those including some from an off-price department store and an Amazon brand set.I ordered they Gray and am happy that they’re not too light colored. The rose gold hardwear looks beautiful and matches the others I have. I didn’t inspect all 50, but only found small defects on about 5. Just small spots where the velvet rubbed off some, but 5 out of 50 isn’t bad! Altogether, looks very handsome. Also, the “Made in China” stamp is on the INSIDE of the hook. I don’t like when it’s printed on the outside; doesn’t look good next to the others, but that’s my own craziness.I am organizing our closet, so I ordered 50 for my clothes, meaning to move the 25 navy ones to my persons shirts. I did not realize that man had so many clothes! Ended up using most of the grays for his things and now I have to order another set for my clothes. I should just switch him some of my blush pink ones. I think blush and gray would alternate pretty nice, actually:).Overall, these HOUSE DAYs are a pretty solid brand of velvet hangers. Great value. For my next set I may order from a different Seller and will update this review with comparisons. Though I’m afraid maybe the gray of another brand won’t match these but I’ll go with it anyhow.Highly recommend these if you want to spruce up your closet or are sick of your clothes falling off other hangers.

No such luck, I spent an hour until I finally found these. What was once regarded as the cheapest hanger you could buy sells now for as much as five bucks each. No I am not making that up. And most of them want you to take 50 or even a hundred. I only needed a few to fill a small space and I purposely wanted wire because I’m hanging everyday tee shirts, not heavy winter jackets.HELPFUL HINTSFollowing are some hints based on what I learned (or already knew). First, I didn’t need or want wooden hangers. They are great for hanging coats but the design makes them take up too much space. And plastic? Okay, plastic is great for a lot of things but rarely for a clothes hanger. There are laws of physics that can’t be broken - the thinner a plastic hanger is the more fragile it will be, and the thicker it is the bulkier it will be. I have yet to find a thin plastic hanger that doesn’t break. Period. For my needs all I needed was the kind grandma has, unfortunately she won’t part with any. I don’t blame her. Yes you can buy them but I couldn’t find any in small quantities that didn’t cost a buck each. So here’s a shopping hint: most people who shop at this site never click further than the first page. That’s where the paid ads are and the more experienced sellers. I had to go all the way to page 7 to find these. They weren’t what I was looking for - I just wanted the cheapest wire hangers like the ones that have served my grandmother’s closet for 50 years, but these meet my criteria of being thin and strong yet I could buy as few as 10 and still pay a reasonable price. And even get them the next day.SO HOW GOOD ARE THEYIf you read their ad, it is accurate, these are good quality, heavier thickness than the cheap ones buy still very space saving. They easily support a shirt/blouse or even a lightweight jacket without sagging and the hook goes further around the pole so they don’t accidentally fall when I lift an adjacent shirt off the rod. They are welded into essentially one piece (you will never be able to use this to get into your car if you lock the keys inside). I found the comments about them having an oily finish to be untrue, as is the thing about them sending you and email with complicated cleaning instructions. Untrue. These hangers are smooth clean chromed steel, ready to use, no cleaning needed.YES NO MAYBEThese are the best overall that I found. There are many others that are virtually the same so it’s not that these are that much better, but I give them higher points for understanding that not everyone wants to buy a hundred hangers, it’s that they better understand how to make a sensible variety of purchase options available and keep them all at a reasonable price.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 23, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Smooth, strong, real steel, awesome!', 'author': 'dechenne cecil', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I finally got sick of messing with plastic hangers that warp and break, because we live where winter is seriously cold, and we have some pretty heavy coats.

These are very thin and light, and although I only bough one order of 50, they take up about the third of the space of the previous hangers I've had. I'm going to place my second order after writing this review.I had no problems with the condition I received them in. They were packaged neatly in an easy to open cardboard box and the hangers themselves were placed in easy to rip open plastic in two bags of 25 each. They were all facing the same way and put together neatly so it was super easy to just take them out and begin hanging my clothes with them. There was barely any lint or debris on the hangers themselves when I received them or any noticeable defects. I've had them since July of last year and they're still doing great. I drop them all the time because of my clumsiness and I'll admit, there are some currently on the floor right now due to it being laundry day. I've stepped on them on accidentally, I've even laid down on one that was hiding between my comforter and they're still unbent and doing fine. If it was the plastic ones that I had before, it would've broken and stabbed me and I probably wouldn't be alive today to write this.If I absolutely HAD to say something negative about them, it's that you have to remember these are velvet, so if you accidentally drop them on your carpet sometimes (like I do) you might have some fuzz get stuck to them. That's easily solved by getting a lint roller and running it over them a few times though. I haven't really noticed any lint from my clothes rubbing off on them either, so all in all it's definitely a good investment. Also, I know these can't hang folded pants, but amazon has the velvet hangers that have the bottom portion of the hanger as well as those little add on clips. I personally fold my pants, so I like these hangers best.You save money, space, and your closet will look better visually by having slim, uniform hangers as opposed to mismatched, bulky, plastic hangers that break if you step on them and will become worn out and discolored over time. These are sturdy, but don't burden your clothes rack heavily and will hang everything wonderfully. What's even betters is that they're great for those articles of clothing that love to slide off the plastic hangers. The velvet holds them securely so that they won't drop off. No more waking up in the middle of the night scared shitless because you heard something fall inside your closet. That reason alone should have you adding this item to your cart.After using them for half a year, they still look brand new and are still performing wonderfully.

Here are three positive aspects: 1. Space-Saving Design: The hangers’ ability to maximize closet space is impressive. I can now neatly organize multiple pairs of pants without taking up excessive room. 2. Sturdy Build: The hangers are well-constructed and sturdy. I haven’t experienced any issues with them bending or losing their shape, even when holding heavier pants. 3. Easy Accessibility: Retrieving a specific pair of pants is now a breeze. The hangers’ design allows for easy access without disrupting the rest of the pants on the rack.However, I’m giving it a four-star rating because of one drawback: 1. Limited Grip on Slimmer Pants: While the hangers work exceptionally well with standard-sized pants, they don’t provide as secure a grip on slimmer or lightweight fabrics. Slimmer pants may occasionally slip off the hanger, requiring readjustment. Although the product comes with clips to address this issue, the clips themselves are not as effective as I’d hoped, often leading to additional adjustments.Despite this minor issue, the Magic Pants Hangers remain a practical solution for efficient closet organization.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States November 21, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Save Space', 'author': 'ReadeR', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'These are one of the best products I have found on Amazon.

I read many reviews before purchasing these. I think these hangers are a little pricey but if they work then it\'s something I\'m willing to buy. We have a small closet and I was never going to be able to fully hang them into the ""extended position"" on my closet rod. I hope one day this changes that I can see how well they work for the purpose of getting things on and off more easily. I bought these with the sole intention of having multiple pants on one hanger, without them sliding off and to hang that way. With that said they work well for dress slacks, not as well for jeans. I think as long as your pants are thinner material (leggings, khaki\'s, business wear) then these are good for that. I found for my jeans a different type of hanger worked better for a fraction of the price. Even with the stopper on the side of the hanger, my thinner pants wanted to slide while the jeans seemed too thick to fit as well. Now, this also may be a difference in my clothing size compared to my husband. I\'m petite while he\'s normal-sized. I feel you really need to position the rods a certain way to make them stay correctly. So, that was a little more hassle than I wanted to deal with each time I tried to get my pants. They are easy to bump when rummaging around in the closet, especially one with little space. I also felt these hangers get a little ""heavy"" once they are full. So, if you want to store dress clothing then these may work well for you. I will say the opening hook is larger which also is a bonus if you have a thicker closet rod. We have an older home built in the 50\'s with a thicker closet rod and these fit nicely around the rod.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 28, 2023', 'is_verified': True}]"

But I picked one up at the store and could tell immediately that it was poor quality. The hangers were so rough that I got a splinter, and the pants hanging bar on the bottom was loose. I briefly considered how long it would take me to sand and finish each of the hangers so they wouldn't snag my clothing or my hands, or if I could con my husband into doing it. (NOTE: These poor quality hangers were NOT the ZOBERs I bought from Amazon.)Instead, I went home and ordered these ZOBER hangers from Amazon. I ordered them about 8 pm and they were delivered before I awakened this a.m. (Amazon delivery people are the best!) I was a little uneasy about ordering them because they looked so much like the poor quality ones I had seen in the store. And out of 8430 reviews on Amazon, two reviewers rated them poor, citing the rough finish and shoddy construction. I was so happy when I opened them and found them to be very good quality, smooth finish, attractive wood, and solid construction. One thing I would mention, they are listed as suit hangers, I suppose because there is also a provision for hanging a pair of pants. For a really good suit, I would go with a hanger whose shoulders actually curve forward to help retain the shape of the suit jacket shoulders. The contour of these hangers is more in a single plane, rather than curving forward. I think these are more appropriate for hanging casual jackets, sweaters, pants, shirts that one would want to keep from wrinkling, or fragile fabric that would be damaged by a wire hanger or cheap thin plastic hanger. Oh, one more thing—these hangers certainly look nice in my closet after the mish-mash of cheap hangers that had been breeding in my closet."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 12, 2022', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect in every way!', 'author': 'Teacher@49%', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I liked these so much that I ordered a second box!!', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States March 3, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Nice and inexpensive', 'author': 'alpo', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'These are nice hangers.

Overall these hangers are a great bang for the buck. For hoodies, sweatshirts and everything else so far they\'re great - very heavy duty, sturdy and reliable. However, when purchasing I was made to believe the velvety texture would be a useful feature -- and indeed it is, but it comes at the expense of user friendliness.I\'ve never had a problem with hangers, and I\'m having a real #firstworldproblems moment for writing this review but I do feel it is worth noting. Never should a tool designed to simplify a task or chore make doing so even more cumbersome.Trying to get even a basic t-shirt properly fitted on one of these hangers far more hassle and time than I care to spend hanging shirts; it might as well be the chore within a chore. No matter the method, your shirts always end up a jumbled mess on the hanger. You can tug and pull and try to ""coax"" the shirt down to proper hanging normally but the texture of these hangers pulls and tugs the shirt so much that three of my shirts have stretched out necks just from gently tugging the hem down.When you have a pile of T-shirts and realize how much of a chore putting one of them on a single one of these hangers, you might regret throwing away that annoying jangling mess of wire hangers you thought you were forever done with.I knew what I was buying, but it turned out to be a negative feature in my case.

My first box was curved - not a big deal because they were for my coats. The other two boxes were straight - those are for my clothes. I reached out to customer service and queried the difference and, Winnie, answered me quickly replacing a few curved hangers that got mixed in with the straight set.GOOD:- Nice expensive-looking hangers- Light weight- Colors were similar...was nervous about boxes from different years, but they matched overall- Hanger swivels - don\'t underestimate this useful feature!- Notches are smooth, so delicate ""strappy"" clothing won\'t snag- Bar has a slight ""grip"" that\'s nice for hanging pants. Was surprised nothing has slipped offOKAY:- You can\'t hang wet items on this...it\'s wood! I\'ve saved a few plastic hangers to dry hand-washed items- There may be color variances (this seems inevitable since it\'s wood)- Some of the hangers had a few rough spots, but not in areas that would snag clothes; I\'ve used all the hangers with no concerns- Not all the hangers hang uniformly. I hung them all up first, and switched a few around (I know, I\'m special) but once I had clothing on them, you can\'t see any hanging issues.This is a really nice seller, they care about product quality, and resolve issues quickly.

Jackson', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'From the photo I\'ve included, you can see how crowded my closet is...you should have seen it before! This will probably be thinned out as soon as the weather gets warmer so I can put away the bulky sweaters. However, I can\'t get over how much I like these hangers! I\'ve wanted to try velvet hangers for awhile, but they were either too cheap, or way too expensive! The first box I ordered were the teal. They came in a big cardboard box with five plastic bags containing 10 hangers each. The colors were more vibrant than I expected from the photos. However, I was most impressed by their performance. I have a number of stretchy knit dresses, silky blouses, and sweaters, all that constantly slipped off the hangers to the floor, or if they stayed on, they tended to be stretched out. When I put these items on the velvet hangers; they stayed put. They are also less bulky than those terrible plastic hangers (and I don\'t even know if wire hangers are a thing outside laundromats). Now I can hang up more of the clothes that were either crammed into the drawer, or folded on top of the closet shelf, or even left in the laundry basket. I immediately decided I needed more of these things, but opted for a fun purple instead. They were of the same quality as before. So, I have a total of 100 hangers, and I have them ALL in use!Yes, they are lightweight and they seem somewhat ""bendy"". I don\'t think they would be suitable for a heavy winter coat. The heaviest item on the hangers are a few sweatshirts and lightweight hoodies. Most of my clothing is lightweight, stretchy, or slippery---usually all three. It\'s a relief to be able to open the closet and not find half my clothes on the floor, or having to re-hang things just because I had to move the hangers to look for something. I\'m careful about removing the hangers from the clothes or from the rack. In the past, I\'ve been careless and impatient with other hangers and managed to snap them in half. However, I\'ve taken reasonable care with these, and so far, none of them have broken or even gotten bent.I read a lot of reviews where customers have complained about fuzz and even color transferring onto their clothing, but that has not been my experience. I haven\'t noticed any transfer with the teal or purple hangers. Maybe certain other colors are problematic---I don\'t know. I also do not use these hangers for wet clothing that I take out of the washer to air dry. I still put wet or damp clothes on plastic hangers, or drape them over a rack. I was concerned that the water or moisture might damage the hangers. Again, I have had no problems of fuzz or transferred dye on my clothes. I\'ve had buyers\' regret from time to time with online purchases, but I am SO glad I took a chance and ordered these. I\'ve only had the hangers for about four months now, and if most of them last at least a year, I\'ll be happy.

These flocked hangers (the industry calls them ""velvet.) were nicely finished and when I opened the boxes (I ordered 100), I was delighted not to see little bits of flocking floating around in the box. One thing that I noticed right away was that they seemed sturdier than some other brands that I have bought, even though the cost per hanger was not that much greater. This is important, since one reason that I needed new hangers was that so many of mine had broken and been discarded. I went back and looked at the description, and these are rated to hold a weight almost twice that of most of the others. Yay! As I was reorganizing my closet, I found that I could hang wool coats without fear. And they were pretty! The light blue was a color I had not seen before and since my room and closet are painted light blue the esthetic was very agreeable. It was light enough that I didn\'t need to worry about dye transferring to my clothes (some black hangers do this for months after you start using them.)

They\'re not crazy expensive, they\'re very sturdy, and they\'re designed with a lot of practicality that I like. Example.That funky ""nook"" in the middle of the hanger makes it MUCH easier to slide a t-shirt onto the hander and not stretch out the neck part of the shirt (yeah, you know what I mean, I\'m pretty sure we all put the hanger through the head part of the shirt instead of the bottom). You won\'t have to worry about that with this hanger. Even if you didn\'t worry about it, you\'ll notice how much easier it is to slip a shirt onto the hanger (like a turtle neck) without much stretching.I also love the little knobs it has to hole things that slide off easily, slip shirts, satin, silk. It keeps everything in place with the little rubber parts.The other thing I love about this is how thin the profile is. 2 of these hangers are the width of one of my old clothes hangers.

These hangers are smooth so he can just grab the sleeve of a shirt and yank it off the hanger instead of having to be careful like you do with the velvet ones. Unlike the plastic hangers we used to have, these will tolerate a lot of abuse. I’ll buy more to replace the rest of the plastic hangers now that I’ve seen how good they are. The only thing I dislike is that the hook is really deep. It’s not necessarily a bad thing, but it makes them harder to hang if the clearance between your rod and shelf is a bit narrow.

Since I have some wooden hangars easily 45 years and still good as new, I will say that a lot of the cost hangars I look at today don’t look like they could make it for a tenth that time. A lot of the really heavy plastic hangars seem to plasticize after some time and them just break. I bought these wood ones to help my wife with her closet organization. They look Sewell made, and I would expect them to perform well. The spring clips are strong and likewise seem well made.When I compare this hanger to my older hangars, the first thing that I notice is the size of the hook is smaller as is the gauge of the wire used to make the hook. The next thing I notice is that the hoint in the wood at the peak of the hangar at first glance looks face glued as opposed to a rounded box joint on the old hangar. However, upon close inspection the wood is finger jointed in the new hanger. I can tell you the joint in the wood looks better on the older hangar, but I have a feeling the glue used in the new hangar is probably superior to glue used in the 60s, 70’s or 80’s.Despite the differences in the new hangars, so far so good, I can say that I was impressed and would definitely buy them again.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States November 10, 2020', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Fictionally pretty', 'author': 'Carin', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Works well for my work scrubs', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 11, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Cohesive closet', 'author': 'Delvena Westmoreland', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""Changed out all the mix-match hangers to all wood hangers...2 thumbs up!

But I picked one up at the store and could tell immediately that it was poor quality. The hangers were so rough that I got a splinter, and the pants hanging bar on the bottom was loose. I briefly considered how long it would take me to sand and finish each of the hangers so they wouldn't snag my clothing or my hands, or if I could con my husband into doing it. (NOTE: These poor quality hangers were NOT the ZOBERs I bought from Amazon.)Instead, I went home and ordered these ZOBER hangers from Amazon. I ordered them about 8 pm and they were delivered before I awakened this a.m. (Amazon delivery people are the best!) I was a little uneasy about ordering them because they looked so much like the poor quality ones I had seen in the store. And out of 8430 reviews on Amazon, two reviewers rated them poor, citing the rough finish and shoddy construction. I was so happy when I opened them and found them to be very good quality, smooth finish, attractive wood, and solid construction. One thing I would mention, they are listed as suit hangers, I suppose because there is also a provision for hanging a pair of pants. For a really good suit, I would go with a hanger whose shoulders actually curve forward to help retain the shape of the suit jacket shoulders. The contour of these hangers is more in a single plane, rather than curving forward. I think these are more appropriate for hanging casual jackets, sweaters, pants, shirts that one would want to keep from wrinkling, or fragile fabric that would be damaged by a wire hanger or cheap thin plastic hanger. Oh, one more thing—these hangers certainly look nice in my closet after the mish-mash of cheap hangers that had been breeding in my closet."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 12, 2022', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect in every way!', 'author': 'Teacher@49%', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I liked these so much that I ordered a second box!!', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States March 3, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Nice and inexpensive', 'author': 'alpo', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'These are nice hangers.

Here are three positive aspects: 1. Space-Saving Design: The hangers’ ability to maximize closet space is impressive. I can now neatly organize multiple pairs of pants without taking up excessive room. 2. Sturdy Build: The hangers are well-constructed and sturdy. I haven’t experienced any issues with them bending or losing their shape, even when holding heavier pants. 3. Easy Accessibility: Retrieving a specific pair of pants is now a breeze. The hangers’ design allows for easy access without disrupting the rest of the pants on the rack.However, I’m giving it a four-star rating because of one drawback: 1. Limited Grip on Slimmer Pants: While the hangers work exceptionally well with standard-sized pants, they don’t provide as secure a grip on slimmer or lightweight fabrics. Slimmer pants may occasionally slip off the hanger, requiring readjustment. Although the product comes with clips to address this issue, the clips themselves are not as effective as I’d hoped, often leading to additional adjustments.Despite this minor issue, the Magic Pants Hangers remain a practical solution for efficient closet organization.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States November 21, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Save Space', 'author': 'ReadeR', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'These are one of the best products I have found on Amazon.

I read many reviews before purchasing these. I think these hangers are a little pricey but if they work then it\'s something I\'m willing to buy. We have a small closet and I was never going to be able to fully hang them into the ""extended position"" on my closet rod. I hope one day this changes that I can see how well they work for the purpose of getting things on and off more easily. I bought these with the sole intention of having multiple pants on one hanger, without them sliding off and to hang that way. With that said they work well for dress slacks, not as well for jeans. I think as long as your pants are thinner material (leggings, khaki\'s, business wear) then these are good for that. I found for my jeans a different type of hanger worked better for a fraction of the price. Even with the stopper on the side of the hanger, my thinner pants wanted to slide while the jeans seemed too thick to fit as well. Now, this also may be a difference in my clothing size compared to my husband. I\'m petite while he\'s normal-sized. I feel you really need to position the rods a certain way to make them stay correctly. So, that was a little more hassle than I wanted to deal with each time I tried to get my pants. They are easy to bump when rummaging around in the closet, especially one with little space. I also felt these hangers get a little ""heavy"" once they are full. So, if you want to store dress clothing then these may work well for you. I will say the opening hook is larger which also is a bonus if you have a thicker closet rod. We have an older home built in the 50\'s with a thicker closet rod and these fit nicely around the rod.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 28, 2023', 'is_verified': True}]"

Perfect for these type of necklines: boatneck, collared (especially ones that button up/zip close to neck), crew neck, turtle neck/jewel, illusion, keyhole, cowl neck (with mid cap style or longer sleeves), close cut v-neck or v-neck with mid cap or longer sleeves, and square (if you have longer cap sleeves, 3/4 sleeves and long sleeves), plunging neckline with sleeves no shorter than mid cap.Necklines that can be hung using this hanger's hooks: scoop neck w/ spaghetti straps, cami w/spaghetti straps, and halters.Cons: Does not have any type of anti-slip so the following neckline styles will not stay on hanger. Asymmetric, Off the shoulder, Garments with no button/zip/no sleeves (ex>coverups, open style sweaters or vests), Strapless (anything), Deep scoop necks with no sleeves or elastic bands, Deep v-necks with no sleeves or elastic bands.Overall rating: Price is VERY REASONABLE for the amount of hangers that you get.

Yes if I had less clothes I’d have more space but some of these are used for personal use and styling sessions and photo shoots as well.I never thought I’d be on the wire hanger band wagon. I switched to plastic hangers from cheap wire hangers decades ago and ditched dry cleaning hangers before leaving the cleaners. As my wardrobe grew and I had to downsize closet size I switched to the flocked hangers and loved the space they saved and they way they looked. Now I’m just trying to save even more space to maybe put some rolling racks in storage, and decided to try these out.They are a bit smaller but they work for kids clothes really well, and they even hold men’s size large shirts as well.Initially I didn’t like them, but they’re truly pretty decently heavy duty, at least more so than the flocked hangers from Amazon. The Costco brand flocked hangers are bit stronger but also thicker- I use those for heavy blazers.They do smell a bit funky right out of the box- they’re metal. I’m not crazy about the twisted metal and worry about delicate fabrics. They say anti rust but that’s tbd. I’m not sure, but I wouldn’t use them to hang anything damp or wet- I use plastics when I do that.Anyway I was highly irritated about missing 10 hangers but I’m about to order more so I can use these for everyone’s closet.Definitely recommend if you need to save space. They’re strong and I’m glad I got these. I may add a heat shrink tube or something over the twisted part if it becomes an issue.Also I noticed in the photos the silver were straight and the chrome had notched shoulders so that’s what I ordered. I’ll likely order the silver for my husbands clothes and another chrome for kids clothes. If there was a mixed straight and notched set of 100 or 200 I’d order so many!I thought the smaller size would be an issue but it’s actually preferred now.Hopefully this is helpful to someone!Still want my 10 hangers replaced though 😩', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States March 1, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Good quality', 'author': 'K.

You can just tell when you are holding them , how well made they are. I purchased 40 , and my son’ law is getting me another 40 for Christmas. A real treat for myself . Only took a small section of my closet to show the quality of the hangers. Since they flat and not curved , they line up very well and provide more space. Was going to buy another brand at half the price and although reviews mostly were excellent, the negative reviews talked a lot about rough wood and splinters.

Amazon reshipped the order, and this time I looked in the shipping box more carefully, and realized how they were packed.After getting past this step, I found the hangars attractive, well sized, for a man\'s jacket, and they appear to be fairly robust.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 1, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent and Strong, High Quality Wooden Hangers.', 'author': 'hasselaar', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I have tried several brands of wooden hangers carried by Amazon. These are pricey, but well-worth it when considering the the value of some types of clothing demanding this style of hanger. These hangers appear to be close to the quality of those seen in a department store men\'s department, the length of the lower hang rod is long enough to not cause the edge of the trousers to buckle and crease.The top portion is not of the extremely wide design demanded for topcoats, fur coats, and other heavy and fitted garments. But these hangers are perfect for use with men\'s trousers, and lightweight and hangable cardigans and sweaters. Plus - all types of women\'s fine clothing will prosper on these hangers. The hangers are well-finished, with no rough edges to disturb the appearance of a fine silk shirt, and it will not catch and pull on knits, sweaters, and cardigans of certain types.Naturally they are wide-enough at the top to prevent the dreaded ""hanger line"" that appears on both men\'s and women\'s heavier knit, silk, cotton, furs, or almost anything else where a thin line is most definitely not desirable across the shoulder tops. Again, these are not the style of hanger needed to hang a top coat, the suit jacket, ar a large and heavy winter coat.The finish work on these is excellent, the strength is remarkable by its absence from the problematical list, and the price is good for the quality delivered.I have slowly been switching my clothes, and those of my family, to this style of wooden hanger. They are not all of equal quality, some are poorly finished, and the bottom hang bar creases, or even pulls at the pant leg.This particular style of this particular brand is of good quality, and worth considering when reviewing hanger choices.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States April 19, 2016', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars High quality', 'author': 'KT2ME', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'We have had these for years and have held up great.

Very simple packaging - nothing fancy, just a bit of foam wrap with tape and put in the box. This is fine with me. If they are coming from Amazon, they don\'t need anything fancy really. Twenty seems like plenty of hangers for my use!I did not try hanging trousers on them as I don\'t really have any need to do that, but the rod has a bit of plastic over it, which should prevent it from snapping if it were to be pulled on or something.

Luckily the bushing popped out when it hit the floor, so I tried again without it and pushed harder on the hook as I screwed it in. It seated much better and I was able to screw the hook further in, but I still think the pilot hole is too wide. I skipped the bushing altogether when putting the second hanger together.I do like that there are alternating heights of hooks, but I wish some had more space between them.

Heshberg adds extra bracing in five different area, which absolutely make a difference when it comes to strength. The plastic they use also seems to be more flexible, and not brittle like the other generic brands. When plastic is too brittle, it is much more prone to breaking. I still use much thicker “heavy duty” hangers for some of my thicker winter and tactical pants, as well as heavy jackets. I know the Heshberg hangers will hold them up, but I feel that over time the hook part that goes over the closet rod will start to open up, which is why I am giving them a 4 star rating and not a 5. Don’t get me wrong, for almost all of my clothing hanger needs, these work great. I’m a relatively big guy (I wear 2XL shirts/jackets), so my clothing is noticeably heavier than clothing made for S, M, L and XL wearing folks.My wife loves these hangers because the notches keep her clothing with shoulder straps and enlarged collars from sliding off.The black hanger in the attached pic is a Heshberg hanger.

Sometime last year, on a different account I made 2 more orders. I currently have 6 sets. The original 2 sets, are still doing great. Of the other 4 sets and the 20 individual hangers, about half of them are slightly warped and have difficulty fitting into the slots. Also, as a woman who usually wears XS, I have found that the hangers are too wide for some of my sweaters and tops. On the up side, the price has only gone up $5 in 2 years.

So if I am grasping the hanger where the pants fold over the bottom part of the hanger, the top of the hanger flops over - my old hangers have more of a foam than a rubber, so when I hold it there it grips the pants fabric better and I can put it back on the rod. So, with these new hangers I need to hold the hanger by the top to put it back on the rod. A minor inconvenience.

However, once I had them set up, they proved to be a game-changer for my gym leggings.I absolutely love using these hangers for my leggings collection. They make it so much easier to see all my options at a glance, which means no more digging through a messy pile to find the perfect pair. It's like having a mini-leggings boutique in my closet!What's even better is that with these hangers, I can ensure I'm not losing any leggings in the depths of my closet. Everything is so organized and easily accessible. It's been a lifesaver for keeping track of my activewear.In conclusion, if you're looking to get your leggings collection organized, these pant hangers are a fantastic choice.

Plus my tops kept slipping off the cheap, tubular plastic hangers and falling to the floor, resulting in my not being able to find desired pieces in a timely fashion. Frustrating!!!Time for a quarantine project.I shopped for hanger alternatives. I quickly ruled out velvet hangers because they seemed to have too many drawbacks with the flocking and bleeding. The wooden hangers are beautiful and sturdy, but take up a lot of space, especially for lighter garments such as blouses.Then I found these hangers.Positives: The slip-through feature is genius and protects the necks of pull-on shirts. They are non-slip so my blouses stay where I put them. They have little hooks for matching camisoles. They are very thin, so many more garments can fit in a smaller area. They look beautiful in the closet (I organized my blouses according to color).Negatives: I just purchased them but, no, they do not look sturdy. They are obviously NOT for heavier garments (suits, trousers, coats, etc). For trousers I prefer to use the heavier wood-clip hangers, though these hangers would probably be fine for lighter bottoms such as leggings and skirts. For suits I prefer the larger suit hangers to help matching blazers keep their shape. But now there is so much more room to adequately fit these heavier garments (on their proper hangers) without cramming them in.In sum: they are perfect for my needs.

They're strong enough for everything from tank tops to jackets. I haven't tried them with super heavy winter coats or anything like that, but I think they would still be fine. The rubber grip is great. I haven't had any problems with shirts slipping onto the floor since I bought these, even polyester tank tops, which are notoriously difficult to keep on a hanger.

They definitely seem like they will hold up over time. The material used to make them feels more robust and less brittle than a standard plastic hanger.That said, they are not as easy to remove as advertised. If there isn't enough weight on the hanging rod, the rod will lift off its ends. In this situation, removing a hanger becomes a two-handed operation. That said, most RV closets are stuffed full, which eliminates the problem. It only affect me with the mostly empty rod that runs above the RV shower.Unfortunately, the packaging is more appropriate for a brick & mortar store than an online business. The hangers are exposed by the packaging. I ordered five packs and the hangers all arrived soiled.

After purchasing one pack of these and trying them out with various styles and fabrics, I had to purchase another for the rest of my clothes.PROS:-They are very slim - I measured before and after, and they really do take up less space.-Slippery fabrics do not fall off these hangers.-The curves are very gentle, and therefore, my sweaters no longer get that awkward ""hanger bump"" on the shoulder.-Okay, I\'ll be honest. I really like that my closet looks like the closets in those showrooms - very neat and orderly.CONS:-I do not trust my heavy coats with these. However, I don\'t think they were made for heavy-duty clothes, so I don\'t know if I can really count this as a negative mark against the product.Also, if you\'ve read the other reviews, you might have read that they can break easily. I have been using these for over six months now, and not a single hanger has broken. Maybe they improved the workmanship since the previous reviewers. Maybe I\'m just lucky with both packs I received. I don\'t know. But I do know that they have served me well and my sister now has a set of black Honey-Can-Do hangers in her house after borrowing a few of mine.EDIT: Three years later, and I\'m still using these same hangers.

Clothes used to slip right off my wooden hangers but these have grip plus they save a ton of space in your closet.Some things to consider before you buy:-These hangers work great for tanks, tees, light-medium sweaters, light jackets, leggings and dresses. You may want to keep some sturdy wooden hangers for pants, jeans, heavy sweaters, coats, and jackets.-You may break one or two while you adjust to handling. These are delicate hangers. I don't grab them by the ends and jerk them like I do with my wooden hangers. You have to push other clothes out of the way and grab them by the top. I broke one by jerking it.

That should not happen if you are using the correct hanger.

Other people may have different experiences of course, but by and large this product should not shed or discolor. If this is a concern, they do come in light, neutral colors.

These really are space savers (and they look nice, too)', 'author': 'Laurie', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""So I never saw myself as the kind of person to get enthusiastic over. . . pants hangers. I was always content to use the hangers that came with my new pants from the store. But that was before I started watching home organizing shows. After swooning over videos of perfectly organized closets I decided to give these space savers a try, especially since the section in my closet where I hang my pants tends to get pretty packed.My first impression of these hangers was that they are well-made of quality materials. These are solid metal hangers with some heft to them. They don't feel flimsy at all.I first hung one of the hangers horizontally, with both hooks on the closet rod, and hung five rather substantial pairs of jeans on them. I was a little concerned at first whether the pants would stay on the metal bars, as they didn't have any velvet or similar material to help in that regard. Turns out that my pants are happy to stay put on the bars, no problemo. So far so good.But next came the real test. I removed one of the hooks from the rod and gently let it fall, a little nervous that my jeans may land in a heap on the floor. Voila! Not only did my jeans stay put, but I suddenly had free space in my closet! Now my jeans are neat and organized, I can find the ones I want to wear easily, and my closet is one step closer to being photoshoot-ready (ok, that last part isn't quite true).Seriously though, I like these so much that I plan to invest in more for myself and my husband, as well as for use in our snug RV closets.

Before using them, my wardrobe was a jumbled mess of pants, making the task of finding the right pair of pants every day difficult. Hangers at home have revolutionized the way I organize my wardrobe. They allow me to hang my pants neatly, create more space, and make it easier for me to locate what I need. The hanger's slim profile allows me to fit more pants in a smaller space, maximizing the closet's storage capacity. This versatility makes it a must-have for anyone looking to streamline their wardrobe organization. The sturdy stainless steel hook and anti-slip design won't wear out even with repeated use.

This pants hanger offers you two positions -- hanging horizontally with two steel hangers (see my photo), or hanging nearly vertically by supporting the pants hanger by just one steel hanger. The pants hanger then cleverly moves into a graduated, tiered-type position. I found it's easier to remove or replace the pants in the horizontal position. The vertical position seems to gain a little space near the clothing rod, but not too much lower down as the pants extend somewhat diagonally. The pants sit on the bar in a stable position, which I like. The whole pants hanger feels sturdy and features five bars for pants hanging. I don't have any pants slippage although the seller suggests you can use clothespins if desired to hold your pants on the bars."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 17, 2024', 'is_verified': False}]"

These really are space savers (and they look nice, too)', 'author': 'Laurie', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""So I never saw myself as the kind of person to get enthusiastic over. . . pants hangers. I was always content to use the hangers that came with my new pants from the store. But that was before I started watching home organizing shows. After swooning over videos of perfectly organized closets I decided to give these space savers a try, especially since the section in my closet where I hang my pants tends to get pretty packed.My first impression of these hangers was that they are well-made of quality materials. These are solid metal hangers with some heft to them. They don't feel flimsy at all.I first hung one of the hangers horizontally, with both hooks on the closet rod, and hung five rather substantial pairs of jeans on them. I was a little concerned at first whether the pants would stay on the metal bars, as they didn't have any velvet or similar material to help in that regard. Turns out that my pants are happy to stay put on the bars, no problemo. So far so good.But next came the real test. I removed one of the hooks from the rod and gently let it fall, a little nervous that my jeans may land in a heap on the floor. Voila! Not only did my jeans stay put, but I suddenly had free space in my closet! Now my jeans are neat and organized, I can find the ones I want to wear easily, and my closet is one step closer to being photoshoot-ready (ok, that last part isn't quite true).Seriously though, I like these so much that I plan to invest in more for myself and my husband, as well as for use in our snug RV closets. These are a great find.

One of the most notable features of these hangers is their anti-slip design. The anti-slip feature is a testament to the thoughtful design of these hangers. Before using them, my wardrobe was a jumbled mess of pants, making the task of finding the right pair of pants every day difficult. Hangers at home have revolutionized the way I organize my wardrobe. They allow me to hang my pants neatly, create more space, and make it easier for me to locate what I need. The hanger's slim profile allows me to fit more pants in a smaller space, maximizing the closet's storage capacity. This versatility makes it a must-have for anyone looking to streamline their wardrobe organization. The sturdy stainless steel hook and anti-slip design won't wear out even with repeated use.

This pants hanger offers you two positions -- hanging horizontally with two steel hangers (see my photo), or hanging nearly vertically by supporting the pants hanger by just one steel hanger. The pants hanger then cleverly moves into a graduated, tiered-type position. I found it's easier to remove or replace the pants in the horizontal position. The vertical position seems to gain a little space near the clothing rod, but not too much lower down as the pants extend somewhat diagonally. The pants sit on the bar in a stable position, which I like. The whole pants hanger feels sturdy and features five bars for pants hanging. I don't have any pants slippage although the seller suggests you can use clothespins if desired to hold your pants on the bars."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 17, 2024', 'is_verified': False}]"

They are such a SOFT velvet, I love feeling them while doing laundry and hanging them up in the nursery closet. The soft pink color is adorable - very neutral pink. The first set that was gifted years ago was the baby blue set which is a muted blue and very nice looking as well. Needless to say - I wish I found these years ago with my first child.

These hangers do just that - they are sturdy and strong, and I have no doubt that they will last us a long time.Another great feature of these hangers is how versatile they are. They work well for all types of kids' clothing, from tiny baby clothes to bigger kids' outfits (although I would stay under size Big Kid Large, My 8-year-old wears a size large and they fall off). Plus, they are designed in a way that makes it easy to hang and remove clothes, which is a huge plus when you're trying to get your little ones dressed in a hurry.Overall, I am really happy with my purchase of these kids' hangers.

Being that they are both teens they didn’t want to share closets anymore so we had to think of how to set up something. My daughter has a large room so I decided to buy her a wooden closet like system.We used plastic hangers on her clothes for years but now that she’s getting bigger her clothes would slide off or hang down on one side or fall off when she pulled something next to it off. I thought any velvet hangers until I saw these wooden ones and thought “hey, these would go perfectly with her closet system!” I decided to buy the 50 pack cause I wasn’t sure how much she would actually hang Of her hundreds of clothes.Arrived and we tried them out the same day! They are really nice quality. Kinda reminds me of hotel hangers!!!! Except the hook doesn’t come off like hotel ones. These are nicely secured on. The wooden is really smooth and well made. I ran my hands across it to make sure there were no splinter areas that would snag the clothes or hurt my daughter. It was as smooth as a bum. They are also glossy which makes them even more beautiful.They are thick and durable. As you can see in the pictures most of them are hanging up hoodies and heavy sweaters since those are most bulky and can’t all fit in Her drawers.Her clothing so far does not fall off or hang. They are a little bigger than a typical plastic hanger. With groves for clothing that requires them. The rod is durable and holds up a few sweatpants within the hoodie hanging (as a set).The way they look against her wooden closet system is gorgeous and stands out in her room. She is going for a boho room theme, with natural wood colors and macramé accent decor pieces.She’s so happy with them and I’m so jealous of them.

I don’t really leave reviews, but god knows I read them when I buy a product. When I bought this product there weren’t many reviews up, but I wanted to try it from this seller because I bought the pant hanger and I knew to expect great quality. So because of great this product has been, I felt like I owed it to the universe to leave an honest review.I can’t believe how amazing this product is and I can’t believe I’ve lived in small spaces without knowing this existed.- Assembly: As someone who hates to assemble anything, I’m always hesitant to buy something that doesn’t come ready in the box. But once I got it I realized that it needs very simply assembly so that it’s packed nicely and my product can come without any scratches. It comes with the metal hanger and one screw to go on each side, and even has an extra screw and the tool you need. It’s basically simple and easy assembly for newbies like me.- Quality: Like I said, I only decided to try this because I knew to expect high quality from this seller. The wood is beautiful and looks expensive, so the price is shockingly fair. The metal is high quality. The clips for the skirts also have a protective enamel layer on them, which I love because it protected my leather skirt from being ruined or having marks on it.- Space-saving: My closet is not as big as I would like for it to be, and this made so much more space for me to put other things. On top of it it just gives off such a high-end clean look to my closet that I need to buy another pack to make sure all of my skirts have a home on one of these.Overall, I really have zero complaints.

I have 2 closets across from each other and hung a rod between them so I can pull this out of my closet and spread it out on the rod to choose which pants shorts or skirt I want to wear and put it back in my over pack closet more easily than if I were to go through separate hangers looking for something to wear. Doing it that way clothes tend to get pulled off the clips. These are very sturdy and I don't mind if my clothes have a mark from the clip. Better than falling off the clips onto the floor and getting wrinkles. I really love it. I previously bought another brand...it didn't hold up. This hanger seems it will last my lifetime. So it's nice looking, convenient, and just wish this company made a hanger for bras and tank tops. I may have to get more of these and just clip them instead of getting another brand where it would allow me to hang them on hooks. I love that I can spread out my clothes using the hangers hooks at both ends of the hanger. I've already bought a 2nd one. They're kinda expensive but worth it and I can see me buying more in my future. Oh and for those who don't have over stuffed closets, they will like that the hook has a swivel so it can remain in your closet while you choose the item you want to wear. I struggle with the top part. I think 2 hang kinda close together but they flip up out of the way when I am getting an item off the hanger I think the way it's made is probably the best option instead of not being flexible.. You might understand what I mean when you get one. Try it, it's worth it. I highly recommend buying these hangers. They will probably be versatile enough to use for my bras and tank tops.

It occurred to me that I have a lot of hangers and switching to natural wood would be a great way to get rid of a lot of plastic. But there are a ton of different brands on Amazon, and unfortunately for my purposes most of them have a PVC or vinyl liner around the trouser bar on the bottom of the hanger - even if the rest of the hanger is all wood construction.These FairyHaus hangers never specifically mention the vinyl liner, so I wasn’t sure if it would be present. But there is no liner, no PVC, no plastic of any kind. These are 100% natural wood, with a smooth finish (no rough burs), and they are very slim, allowing for more clothes to fit on one rod than is possible with thicker hangers.The only potential downside is the bottom rod is stapled to the frame in such a ways that with enough weight it would come apart. This isn’t a negative for me because I don’t plan on using that portion of the hanger, but if you intend to hang denim pants then these may not be for you.I’m preparing to purchase another set.

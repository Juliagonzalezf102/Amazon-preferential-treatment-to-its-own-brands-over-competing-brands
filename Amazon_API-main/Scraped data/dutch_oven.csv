I’ve owned this 4.5 Qt. Amazon Enameled Cast Iron Dutch Oven for almost two months and have used it three times to date. Upon arrival and at first glance, the gradient blue color is beautiful and super glossy; most importantly, the pot is heavy for its size - as it should be. It looks exactly like the product pictures, with a globular shape than square shape as others. Unfortunately, I also noticed that there was one pin hole and two tiny uneven protrusions on the enamel inside the pot.I own three other enameled cast iron cookware from two other brands (photos attached for size comparison) and performance wise, this cast iron by Amazon performs equally to them. The pot isn’t exceptional or special but it gets the job done. Other than the pin holes and protrusions, I have no complaints. This isn’t my first rodeo so when heating up the pot and while cooking, I have zero issues.I am starting the pan off at 4-Stars and will update my review as time progresses, or if I have any major issues with its durability or performance in subsequent months. For the amateur home cook, or for anyone who is new to cast iron cooking, below I’ve included tips that you may find useful while using this or any other enameled cast iron cookware.================================Regarding the 3 Photos and 1 video I've Attached:(Note: all photos were taken with an iPhone under kitchen lights during the evening. Photos have not been edited nor enhanced.)Photo 1: Size comparison of this Amazon Enameled Cast Iron Dutch Oven compared to three other enameled cast iron cookware that I own from two other brands.

Amazon Enameled Cast Iron Dutch Oven on gas stove over medium heat, with food cooking.================================TIPS THAT YOU MAY FIND USEFUL While Using your cast iron dutch oven:(Note: I included these similar tips in my review of a different enameled cast iron pot from a different brand. My tips can apply to all enameled cast iron cookware)1. If you find that you have issues with food sticking, it could be that you are not heating up your cast iron pot properly to prevent undue hot spots.I heat my pot up gradually starting at low, then medium, then high heat. After my pot is very hot is when I add my fat/cooking oil. As the oil is heating up in the pot, I lift it and swirl the oil around to coat all sides of the pot that will come in contact with food.2. Take into consideration the temperature of the items you are adding to your heated pot. As a general rule for cooking: when ever possible, ensure that the items you are adding to a hot pot are at room temperature, rather than ice cold from the fridge; this will assist with even cooking.3. Also, get comfortable with adjusting your heat by lowering and raising it based on what you’ve added to the pot. In general, you will need more heat at the beginning of the cooking process, and less heat towards the end. If you cook by recipe, I highly recommend that you read all the steps ahead before starting, so that you become familiarized with all the procedures, allowing you to maneuver accordingly when you start cooking.4. At the exception of searing meat to achieve a brown crust, deep frying, or when caramelizing onions, you should be stirring your pot (I recommend using a wooden spoon) every few minutes when cooking in cast iron that is placed over high heat. If you are braising on the stove at low heat versus braising in the oven, the frequency of your stirring will need to be adjusted. No matter how you’re cooking though, a watchful eye on the pot plus stirring, should both be a habit not an afterthought.5. For all cooking vessels in general but especially for cast iron: after cooking, allow your pot to cool down completely before cleaning. NEVER immerse a hot cast iron pot into cold water, nor pour cold dish water into hot pot. You risk not only being scald by dangerous steam, but you also risk weakening the enamel, therefore lessening the durability of your pots over time.6. This cookware and others like it from Tramontina and Lodge are economical and if used correctly, will perform well for most cooking; if used correctly, they should also last for years. Nonetheless, if you can afford it, authentic enameled cast iron cookware made in France by Le Creuset is the best way to go. Le Creuset is the gold standard in cast iron cookware and their quality is second to none. I definitely recommend this Amazon dutch oven but if you can afford to splurge, Le Creuset's reputation is stellar. As a professional chef, I've used them in high end kitchens and their quality and performance is premier."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2018', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars I LOVE this pot!', 'author': 'Rebekah F.', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I purchased this as a post-Christmas gift for myself. I consider myself a pretty good cook and I have a great selection of cookware--from plain cast iron to non stick and stainless. But never purchased an enameled pot. My sister has several and loves hers (like me, she loves to cook, too!) A couple of my large Dutch ovens were getting a little beat up after 30+ years of using them. I decided to look into an enameled one. I started doing a little research on the 'best' enameled dutch oven and I was absolutely gobsmacked when Amazon's brand came in second overall--even against the big, well-known brands! So, after checking it out here, and happily finding that it comes in RED, I ordered one.Since I got it, it has pretty much lived on my stove full time. I have made several soups , braises, and a vat of chili for Super Bowl in it. It cleans up beautifully. It IS heavy and it is big, but I love it. It has become my go-to pot for any soup, stew, chili, braise. It is just wonderful and I will probably buy the smaller one, as well. I just need to eliminate some of my lesser used cookware to make space for them. I do not think you will be disappointed with this purchase. FYI, I do hand wash ALL my cookware--even the ones that say dishwasher safe, and I do not stack my pots or pans without a separator between.As far as chipping of the enamel, I certainly have not had that issue, but then, I have only had this for a couple of months.

This cast iron pot with lid isn't just for cooking, you will make memories with your family and then one day it will be passed down to the next generation -cast iron lasts forever.

Boil in pot for two minutes or until food stuck to pot softens, etc. This is to sterilize the pot. Then scour this pot with dawn and brillo or some other metal scrubbing pad. Once all visible food is removed and pot appears clean, rinse with hottest water possible. Put pot and clean lid into the oven to dry. That's it :) No further efforts are required, no seasoning necessary. My family has used this method for more than twenty years on various cast iron pots and pans, I write this to assure you our method works perfectly.***UPDATE: Whenever food burns, due to the ridges in the bottom of the pan, it's extremely difficult to clean...

I'm from the south. I've been cooking with cast iron since before I was strong enough to lift it. This is a good pot. I liked the 2-quart pot so much that I bought a second one. Now I have two. Both pots were from the warehouse, discounted because they had been returned. They both work flawlessly. I have had cheap cast iron from family dollar and upscale cast iron from Cabellas. This pot from Amazon is mid range. Its not as nice as my great grandmother's pre-WW1 pot, but its about as good as Lodge. I like this size for cooking rice (2-cups dry, 4 cups water, 20 minutes on low after boiling). It makes better rice than you've ever had from a rice cooker and it keeps the rice warm for at least an hour without burning. Just leave the lid on and take it off the stove after cooking. It's also perfect for cooking dried beans. Whether you cook plain beans or add bacon or ham hocks (or turkey necks) for seasoning, the beans cook fast and evenly. They do not have to be watched every minute. On medium-low, covered, they're tender in an hour (assuming you soaked them overnight). I can cook beans in one pot, rice in the second pot, and dinner requires almost zero attention. Since I do a lot of simmering in my pots, they require regular care. I wash them with a scrub brush and a dab of Dawn dish detergent. I have never put one in the dishwasher. I think that would be foolish. After washing, I let them drip dry for a few minutes and then dry with a dish towel. Finally I rub cooking fat on both the lid and pot with a paper towel. I use vegetable oil. My grandmother used Crisco. My great-grandmother used lard. My mother didn't use cast iron, she preferred teflon. In my experience the type of cooking fat really does not matter. When the pot becomes rusty, as it inevitably will, there is a simple solution. Rub it liberally with the fat of your choice and cook it in the oven on low overnight. Voila! Instant no-stick coating. Cast iron is the very best cookware ever created. Even cheap cast iron lasts your and your grandchildren's lifetime. Just rub it lightly with fat after washing and then season it a couple of times a year. It never wears out and it adds iron to your diet which is especially nice for pregnant and nursing moms. The 2-quart pot from Amazon is reasonably priced for a pot that will last at least 2-lifetimes and its good enough quality to justify its price. If your pot is rusting, that's your fault and you have the power to correct it. If you don't, then that's on you, not the pot. By all means give it away to somebody who will appreciate it.

Most of us don't spend enough time around the camp fire to season a dutch oven. So on the stove at home is the most realistic. With that said the lid is really difficult to use on a stove top. I have a gas stove and I'd imagine electric is worse. Just the configuration of the lid handle and feet makes it a challenge to get on your stoves's grills.

Since I typically like certain types of pots/pans for certain uses, I was happy to note that there was not only a sauté pan, but a Dutch oven style pot as well. I am enjoying both of them.The pot:The handle on the top of this one seems to be some kind of hard plastic, and I think it's because it's supposed to be oven safe. However, it's ONLY oven safe up to 400 degrees for 30 minutes per the instruction guide. It has smaller metal handles on each side that DO get HOT, so you'll want to have some kind of potholders or mitts at the ready when handling it. The sage green color is beautiful, and the nonstick surface on the inside of the pot is very smooth. Like many others, I cannot help wondering what it is made of, and I really hope that it is safe, because I plan to use these for many years to come if possible. I tend to cook soups, stews and chilis in a Dutch oven style pot, and this one has been extremely easy to use AND clean. It doesn't require a lot of heat to get going, and once it does I typically have to turn it down a bit. The nonstick surface is fabulously easy to clean, and I DO season the surface prior to storing it away. I also seasoned it prior to first use per the instruction guide. I have cooked chili, red beans and chicken soup, all with zero issues.The pan:This is a lovely piece of cookware to have on hand for sautéing and browning. It features a long soft touch handle on one side and a smaller metal handle on the other. Like the pot, you will want to have a mitt or potholder readily available if you plan to touch the smaller handle. The sage color is a perfect match to that of the pot. As many others have stated, it is pretty deep. I have cooked butter chicken and nacho meat and also boiled macaroni (and made the cheese sauce) in this one. All of the dishes came out perfectly, and the pan was super easy to clean. I also season the pan after use.I use silicone utensils to cook with, as I am not a fan of wooden spoons or spatulas.I noticed a bit of discoloration on the bottom of the pan after first use, and I'm not sure whether it was from letting water dry on it or what. I was able to use a cleaning paste to restore it, so I think that I will do this from time to time if I notice any further problems in the future. I also handwash these pots and will probably not put them in the dishwasher. I plan to provide an update in 3 months or so, since that is when several others have noticed issues with the cookware. As for now, I am totally in love with them and hope that that they will last for years to come.Update 1/14/2023: I no longer season the pan after each use and it is still beautifully nonstick. I'm still in love!Update: 1/28/2023: The underside of the handle of the sauté pan is singed, as I have a gas stove. I do not have the flames up high, but somehow the heat has gotten to it.

I dropped the heart shaped Le Creuset and it broke in half, and I had the shamrock which the handle broke off. So, high cost doesn\'t mean they are without issues.

It also doesn't hurt that it is quite beautiful in the Grey finish that I purchased it in. The reason I'm giving this 4/5 stars instead of 5 is because of a few small details in the quality that tarnish this otherwise great dutch oven.1) As another reviewer had already mentioned, the lid fit on the dutch oven leaves a bit to be desired. It doesn't close completely flush and will leave one side slightly lifted up. Time will tell if this leads to a leak that allows steam to escape, if it does I will come back and bring this down to a 3/5.2) This doesn't affect the performance of the dutch oven whatsoever but as someone who works in manufacturing the lack of attention to detail and quality just bothers me. The handle on the top of the lid has the Mueller name laser engraved into it but the engraving was done with improper settings and instead of engraving the name nicely into the handle it instead burned the logo into it. As a result it almost looks like the logo is rusted, I know this is caused by improper power settings on their machine from first hand experience with laser engravers. Also, the handle was ever so slightly too loose out of the box, nothing that a quick turn of a screwdriver didn't fix though.3) There is a small and inconsequential blemish on one of the edges of the enamel on the lid. Does not look like it was caused by damage during shipping, but instead probably during the manufacturing process. Once again, does not affect performance of the lid but just sucks to see from a product right out of the box.Aside from these small details the dutch oven is a perfect size, heats very evenly, and maintains its heat effectively. I would recommend that when you first receive your dutch oven that you go through the steps of seasoning the exposed edges of cast iron under the lid and on the top of the dutch oven rim.

It looks exactly like the product pictures, with a globular shape than square shape as others. Unfortunately, I also noticed that there was one pin hole and two tiny uneven protrusions on the enamel inside the pot.I own three other enameled cast iron cookware from two other brands (photos attached for size comparison) and performance wise, this cast iron by Amazon performs equally to them. The pot isn’t exceptional or special but it gets the job done. Other than the pin holes and protrusions, I have no complaints.

For the amateur home cook, or for anyone who is new to cast iron cooking, below I’ve included tips that you may find useful while using this or any other enameled cast iron cookware.================================Regarding the 3 Photos and 1 video I've Attached:(Note: all photos were taken with an iPhone under kitchen lights during the evening. Photos have not been edited nor enhanced.)Photo 1: Size comparison of this Amazon Enameled Cast Iron Dutch Oven compared to three other enameled cast iron cookware that I own from two other brands.

Amazon Enameled Cast Iron Dutch Oven on gas stove over medium heat, with food cooking.================================TIPS THAT YOU MAY FIND USEFUL While Using your cast iron dutch oven:(Note: I included these similar tips in my review of a different enameled cast iron pot from a different brand. My tips can apply to all enameled cast iron cookware)1. If you find that you have issues with food sticking, it could be that you are not heating up your cast iron pot properly to prevent undue hot spots.I heat my pot up gradually starting at low, then medium, then high heat. After my pot is very hot is when I add my fat/cooking oil. As the oil is heating up in the pot, I lift it and swirl the oil around to coat all sides of the pot that will come in contact with food.2. Take into consideration the temperature of the items you are adding to your heated pot. As a general rule for cooking: when ever possible, ensure that the items you are adding to a hot pot are at room temperature, rather than ice cold from the fridge; this will assist with even cooking.3. Also, get comfortable with adjusting your heat by lowering and raising it based on what you’ve added to the pot. In general, you will need more heat at the beginning of the cooking process, and less heat towards the end. If you cook by recipe, I highly recommend that you read all the steps ahead before starting, so that you become familiarized with all the procedures, allowing you to maneuver accordingly when you start cooking.4. At the exception of searing meat to achieve a brown crust, deep frying, or when caramelizing onions, you should be stirring your pot (I recommend using a wooden spoon) every few minutes when cooking in cast iron that is placed over high heat. If you are braising on the stove at low heat versus braising in the oven, the frequency of your stirring will need to be adjusted. No matter how you’re cooking though, a watchful eye on the pot plus stirring, should both be a habit not an afterthought.5. For all cooking vessels in general but especially for cast iron: after cooking, allow your pot to cool down completely before cleaning. NEVER immerse a hot cast iron pot into cold water, nor pour cold dish water into hot pot. You risk not only being scald by dangerous steam, but you also risk weakening the enamel, therefore lessening the durability of your pots over time.6. This cookware and others like it from Tramontina and Lodge are economical and if used correctly, will perform well for most cooking; if used correctly, they should also last for years. Nonetheless, if you can afford it, authentic enameled cast iron cookware made in France by Le Creuset is the best way to go. Le Creuset is the gold standard in cast iron cookware and their quality is second to none. I definitely recommend this Amazon dutch oven but if you can afford to splurge, Le Creuset's reputation is stellar. As a professional chef, I've used them in high end kitchens and their quality and performance is premier."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2018', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars I LOVE this pot!', 'author': 'Rebekah F.', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I purchased this as a post-Christmas gift for myself. I consider myself a pretty good cook and I have a great selection of cookware--from plain cast iron to non stick and stainless. But never purchased an enameled pot.

Perfect for bread.', 'author': 'Joe MacBu', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I have been cooking with Lodge cast iron for about 7 years and own 8 pieces from their inventory. The Double Dutch Oven is my favorite Lodge cookware due to its versatility.When using a dutch oven, I usually sear the meat first to add flavor. Usually, this requires searing the meat in several batches. The best part about the Double Dutch is that you can sear the meat in the big pot and in the lid simultaneously, thus reducing the time needed to brown the meat by half. Since the lid is then used for the braising step (after deglazing), you\'re not increasing the number of items to be cleaned later.I like the lid so much that I often use it by itself for pan frying. Due to the smallish size (about 10 inches in diameter) and the inherent properties of cast iron, the lid can get incredibly hot if you want it to. Perfect for cooking a steak (it puts on a better crust vs my 12"" Lodge skillet). I\'ve even used it as a pie pan in a pinch. When properly seasoned, the lid also works great for cooking eggs without them sticking. A seasoned cast iron pan is the original nonstick and will outlast any synthetic-coated nonstick pan in the market (and without the toxic fumes).When used as a Dutch Oven, it works like it should. It retains heat well and cooks evenly. There is very little steam that escapes. The smaller 5qt capacity (vs a 7qt Dutch Oven, which I use less now that I\'ve got this one) is also better for cooking moderate amounts of food. Generally, you want little empty space when using a Dutch oven.In response to the reviewer who has problems getting the lid off, I suggest the following. When setting the lid on the pot, don\'t align the handles of the two. This will allow you to remove the lid easily, without having to worry about injuries. I\'ve owned another Lodge 5qt Dutch Ovenwith a more traditional handle - I don\'t miss that one at all...nor do I miss not having a standalone 10"" skillet.UPDATE (December 2010):I\'ve been using this thing for over two years now, several times per week. It is still my favorite, but ever more so. Here\'s one more thing that you can use this for: Baking super awesome bread that rivals anything you can get at your bakery. One of the secrets of making great rustic breads with a thick chewy/crunchy crust and great oven spring is to use a lot of steam for the first 10 minutes of baking. Bakeries use a steam-injected oven. For us at home, using a covered pot, such as this one, is the easiest way to replicate the effects of a steam oven. After shaping a boule, I place it on the lid, cover it with the main pot and let it proof (so the whole pot is upside down). When the dough is ready, I score it and place the covered pot on a preheated stone in the oven for 10-15 minutes. Then I remove the lid and let the top crust brown while the interior reaches the proper temperature. Depending on your oven, you might have to remove the bread from the lid halfway though cooking so the bottom doesn\'t burn - I usually put it on a cool baking tray on a rack without a stone. It\'s a minor inconvenience, but it\'s easier than trying to steam an oven with boiling water, ices cubes, mister, etc. And the results can\'t be beat!', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 26, 2008', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Heavy, Dude', 'author': 'Tsacerof', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Well, it’s supposed to be heavy!

I really like it for it's size and versatility if you're making a meal that you serve. I found that the 2 quart was a bit deep to eat directly out of so I looked at the 1 quart. I put it in my wish list since I couldn't convince myself that the 1 quart was more expensive than the 2 quart. Well last week the price of the 1 quart went down to more than $15 lower so I immediately place an order.I have purchased many Lodge pans from Amazon as well as Lodge itself. Except for the 12 inch Wok arriving in a generic Lodge box (order from Lodge) this 1 quart came factory sealed in a nice yellow Lodge box. This was the first thing that impressed me. Then I opened the box, there were a few excess seasoning around the handle edges but nothing that a little bit of use and re-seasoning can't fix.Even though it arrived late (9pm), I needed to find out if another reviewer was correct about it being the perfect size for a simple packaged ramen. As you can see in the attached picture, it was in fact a perfect size. The hard noodles were very slightly bigger in a couple of corners but a seconds in the boiling water took care of this issue. I usually don't cover ramen when I cook it, but since I had a cover, it worked perfect and it seemed like it helped with the cooking. No boil over at all. No issue with eating right out of the pan; mind the hot handles.Last night I tried out a concentrated Campbell soup. Again, perfect size for a the can content with a can of water. Covered again and heated on a low flame. Can out perfect and again was the right depth for eating right out of the pan.I was still hungry, so I wiped the pan, sprayed with vegetable oil and cooked up a ground beef patty, added onions, pepper and mushrooms. Very versatile. I've done this same thing with the 2 quart but I end up making too much. This 1 quart prevents me from over eating.

So I had no idea what I was doing, in regards to care or use.Guess what. I grew to understand how to keep it looking great and tons of uses for it. In fact it’s cooking our dinner right now. If it’s overwhelming to you but you still want it, get it. It’s quite forgiving.The only problems I can see with the 7 quart one, which is the one I got, are both size related: - It is VERY heavy. And the lid, albeit wonderful, is also heavy. So you need a big spot for it that’s sturdy enough to hold it, and safe enough to get in and out of. My husband built our kitchen cabinets, and the ultimate test was whether a high up shelf in a cabinet would hold this behemoth. It does. But we’re tall and don’t have issues with its weight. If you have issues with carrying big things, may I suggest a lower cabinet for storage? - If you have 1 or 2 people to feed only, it might be a little big for your needs. Maybe try the 5 quart.That’s it. I’d put this item in the ‘Buy it once for life’ and possibly ‘Heirloom’ categories of purchases.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 1, 2024', 'is_verified': True}]"

The enamel is excellent quality I have used several times stove top and baking and it is super easy to clean effortless in fact. Those who have complained about cracks need to understand it must completely cool before you put any cold water on it. Also from what I have read don’t use olive oil to the point it smokes it can stain the pot. Make sure to use vegetable oil in cases you need to cook on high heat. Always use a wood or plastic spoon do not use metal as it’s rough and can scratch the enamel. Use Bar keepers friend or Bon Ami if you need to scrub a tough stains this will not scratch the enamel.

How does it compare to a Lodge?', 'author': 'G. E. Graham', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""This 6qt. blue Dutch oven from Mercer is truly lovely. This finish, both inside and out, is perfect; smooth and clean. It heats beautifully on our induction cooktop and, if it will heat evenly on induction, it will heat well on gas or electric.The design of the Mercer is almost indistinguishable from that of the Lodge 6qt. oven. There are a few exceptions: 1) The Mercer is a smidge taller. 2) The bottom of the Mercer is smooth and unadorned while the Lodge is stamped with their logo. 3) The lip of the lid on the Mercer has a few little stand-offs that the Lodge does not have. These keep the lid from having full enamel to enamel contact with the oven and, I assume, help to prevent chipping. I was concerned that these stand-offs might lift the lid so much as to allow steam/moisture to escape the oven in waves. However, a quick boiling-water test showed that the lid still seats well and keeps in the steam....I noticed no steam escaping from between the lid and the oven. 4) The Mercer oven weighs a significant 12oz. (2/3 lb.) more than the Lodge while the lids of each weigh the same. So, there is more iron in the Mercer which should provide better heat distribution and retention in the Mercer. So far, the Mercer has a slight edge on the Lodge. Now for 5) The knob on the top of the Mercer lid is not as substantial as that on the Lodge (see the photo with the Lodge knob on the left and the Mercer to the right). Even the screw is smaller, and a washer is used to help keep the screw and lid well attached. There is room for a larger screw, which would offer more support to a more substantial knob. This seems to me like a shortcut that is unseemly for such a nice dutch oven. Having said this, the knob is not loose or wobbly and I see no reason that it should affect your decision to buy the Mercer. In full disclosure, my Lodge oven was dropped and the enamel shattered so I took the knob off of my old Lodge and used it on the new Mercer....and I like it better that way.By every measure that matters, this Mercer Dutch oven is a winner and should be considered right along with (if not ahead of) the Lodge when making your buying decision....you won't go wrong with either.

I'm from the south. I've been cooking with cast iron since before I was strong enough to lift it. This is a good pot. I liked the 2-quart pot so much that I bought a second one. Now I have two. Both pots were from the warehouse, discounted because they had been returned. They both work flawlessly. I have had cheap cast iron from family dollar and upscale cast iron from Cabellas. This pot from Amazon is mid range. Its not as nice as my great grandmother's pre-WW1 pot, but its about as good as Lodge. I like this size for cooking rice (2-cups dry, 4 cups water, 20 minutes on low after boiling). It makes better rice than you've ever had from a rice cooker and it keeps the rice warm for at least an hour without burning. Just leave the lid on and take it off the stove after cooking. It's also perfect for cooking dried beans. Whether you cook plain beans or add bacon or ham hocks (or turkey necks) for seasoning, the beans cook fast and evenly. They do not have to be watched every minute. On medium-low, covered, they're tender in an hour (assuming you soaked them overnight). I can cook beans in one pot, rice in the second pot, and dinner requires almost zero attention. Since I do a lot of simmering in my pots, they require regular care. I wash them with a scrub brush and a dab of Dawn dish detergent. I have never put one in the dishwasher. I think that would be foolish. After washing, I let them drip dry for a few minutes and then dry with a dish towel. Finally I rub cooking fat on both the lid and pot with a paper towel. I use vegetable oil. My grandmother used Crisco. My great-grandmother used lard. My mother didn't use cast iron, she preferred teflon. In my experience the type of cooking fat really does not matter. When the pot becomes rusty, as it inevitably will, there is a simple solution. Rub it liberally with the fat of your choice and cook it in the oven on low overnight. Voila! Instant no-stick coating. Cast iron is the very best cookware ever created. Even cheap cast iron lasts your and your grandchildren's lifetime. Just rub it lightly with fat after washing and then season it a couple of times a year. It never wears out and it adds iron to your diet which is especially nice for pregnant and nursing moms. The 2-quart pot from Amazon is reasonably priced for a pot that will last at least 2-lifetimes and its good enough quality to justify its price. If your pot is rusting, that's your fault and you have the power to correct it. If you don't, then that's on you, not the pot. By all means give it away to somebody who will appreciate it.

Since I typically like certain types of pots/pans for certain uses, I was happy to note that there was not only a sauté pan, but a Dutch oven style pot as well. I am enjoying both of them.The pot:The handle on the top of this one seems to be some kind of hard plastic, and I think it's because it's supposed to be oven safe. However, it's ONLY oven safe up to 400 degrees for 30 minutes per the instruction guide. It has smaller metal handles on each side that DO get HOT, so you'll want to have some kind of potholders or mitts at the ready when handling it. The sage green color is beautiful, and the nonstick surface on the inside of the pot is very smooth. Like many others, I cannot help wondering what it is made of, and I really hope that it is safe, because I plan to use these for many years to come if possible. I tend to cook soups, stews and chilis in a Dutch oven style pot, and this one has been extremely easy to use AND clean. It doesn't require a lot of heat to get going, and once it does I typically have to turn it down a bit. The nonstick surface is fabulously easy to clean, and I DO season the surface prior to storing it away. I also seasoned it prior to first use per the instruction guide. I have cooked chili, red beans and chicken soup, all with zero issues.The pan:This is a lovely piece of cookware to have on hand for sautéing and browning. It features a long soft touch handle on one side and a smaller metal handle on the other. Like the pot, you will want to have a mitt or potholder readily available if you plan to touch the smaller handle. The sage color is a perfect match to that of the pot. As many others have stated, it is pretty deep. I have cooked butter chicken and nacho meat and also boiled macaroni (and made the cheese sauce) in this one. All of the dishes came out perfectly, and the pan was super easy to clean. I also season the pan after use.I use silicone utensils to cook with, as I am not a fan of wooden spoons or spatulas.I noticed a bit of discoloration on the bottom of the pan after first use, and I'm not sure whether it was from letting water dry on it or what. I was able to use a cleaning paste to restore it, so I think that I will do this from time to time if I notice any further problems in the future. I also handwash these pots and will probably not put them in the dishwasher. I plan to provide an update in 3 months or so, since that is when several others have noticed issues with the cookware. As for now, I am totally in love with them and hope that that they will last for years to come.Update 1/14/2023: I no longer season the pan after each use and it is still beautifully nonstick. I'm still in love!Update: 1/28/2023: The underside of the handle of the sauté pan is singed, as I have a gas stove. I do not have the flames up high, but somehow the heat has gotten to it.

As with everything I get into, I immediately wanted to read up on them. I had no idea how great these things were! First, the history of the Dutch ovens alone should tell you they are no passing fad and have more than enough usefulness to qualify them on anybody\'s must-have list. They have been providing excellent, simple-to-cook meals for people since the days of the wagon trains. Cooking with charcoal makes the process so easy and cheap and the versatility of the Dutch oven allows it to go from griddle to saute pan to pot to oven by just changing up what you use and how you use it. The lid, inverted, is a griddle. This model\'s lid rim (a design attribute attributed to Paul Revere no less!) is raised to hold coals on top to aid in browning of foods (heat rises, so it\'s hard to brown the top unless you have coals on the lid).Lodge is now producing cast iron cookware that is pre-seasoned, saving you the step of seasoning it before using for the first time. A quick rinse and dry right out of the box and I was cooking. I did a chicken pot pie recipe that was super easy and used refrigerated crescent rolls, rolled out flat, for the crust. A fair amount of coals underneath at first to crank up the heat and pre-cook the chicken and then saute the onions and start the potatoes. Throw in the rest of the ingredients and get to a boil, stirring occasionally, then take a few of the bottom coals and put them on the lid, lowering the bottom heat and getting that important top heat going, then just place the unrolled crescent rolls on top, cover and let it bake. So-o-o-o good!!! Last night I did tamale pie for a party we went to. With hamburger and some homemade Chilean Langaniza sausage I\'d made, I added some corn, Ortegas, olives, bell pepper, enchilada sauce, garlic, freshly ground coarse black pepper and chili powder. That cooked for a while and I mixed up some corn meal with milk and eggs, poured it over the hot food, covered with shredded cheese and cooked until done. Outstanding! The pot was emptied while all the rest of the food got token pickings. There is something about cast iron-cooked food... and it\'s healthier for you than Teflon.I love barbecue, cooking ""low and slow"" to get that tenderness and smoky flavor into my \'cue, and this oven allows that same principle to be incorporated (without the smoke, of course) in just about any meal. You need to nurture the coals during any cooking session, so someone must be there to tend them if you cook at really low temps, but that\'s about the only drawback, and most people will never do that anyway. I bought the metal table with windbreaker sides from Lodge and can\'t wait to use it. I cooked my first meal on my concrete patio and, while it worked great, it will be nice to get the oven up so I don\'t have to stoop to the ground to tend coals and stir/check contents, etc. I cooked the second meal under the shade of my canopy as it was sunny and warm, and I threw down a concrete paver that is about 2\' x 2\' and it worked great too... but I really want to use that new table!Cooking a huge amount? I got the 12"" oven and it\'ll cook enough food for at least ten people in one swoop, and you can always buy the 12 qt. oven that will supply a single pot of food for a huge group but if you need to cook with multiple ovens at the same time, simply stack them. Once you get used to the cleanup method of NO SOAP and get your process down, it is really easy to clean up after cooking too. These products are simply incredible and I wish I had known more details about them before. They last for generations; people actually pass them on to their children.

I immediately went to by a Lodge instead and have been happy with the decision.I have since purchased a Dutch Oven version and it\'s been wonderful for camping. The remainder of this review is based on what I wrote about the Lodge 10"" pan, but the same principles apply here.Pan is already pre-seasoned and smooth (compared to the no-name one), and maintenance has been really simple: after cooking, put water on the pan and heat it up. Then scrub with metal (chainmail scrubber) or wood to get the gunk off. Drain, rinse, heat up again to evaporate all the water, then apply a thin film of oil.If you have JUST received the pan, it\'s best to use bacon to season it per Lodge\'s instructions.We have made many meals with the cast iron and I use it for practically everything. Just put some olive oil or butter while heating up the pan slowly until desired temperature and cook.Maintains heat very well.Skip the silicone handle as that is NOT reliable at all -- started falling apart after just a couple months of usage.

The Lodge lives up to Lodge\'s reputation. Very pleased with it.***Bought from the Amazon Warehouse as an open box or perhaps returned. Arrived in a few days. Packaged in original box but it had been opened and taped shut with that scotch tape that has strings in it, so not by Amazon. It had the original box, packaging, and cookbook/owners manual with it. My 2 year old granddaughter had me read it to her over coffee yesterday - to each their own I guess***I inherited my grandmother\'s 80 year old 12"" spider skillet (looks like a footed dutch oven, only with a long pan handle instead of a bail) early last year. Being big on camping with my horses and friends and family and THEIR horses, I wanted to learn to cowboy cook. A few youtube videos and some reading later, I baked my first 5 layer breakfast casserole at camp last Easter in my grandmother\'s skillet, I was hooked on camp cooking, specifically with all the cast iron I inherited. Later last year, my dad made a tripod for me at his welding shop out of electrical conduit, complete with adjustable chain and hook. An scavenged charcoal grill grate with chains allows me to grill over the camp fire or keep the coffee warm.Back to the dutch ovens - I now own a previously owned 14"" no name (base of the tower) my grandmother\'s 12"", a Camp Chef 10"" and this Lodge 8"". I have not used it yet.Lid fits tight, no wobble (Unlike the camp chef) and the feet are sturdy, substantially sized (Unlike my 14"", which has thin, almost spindly looking feet). I found no imperfections in it. Seasoning is good, but obviously a very light starter coat.I would say this size is good for small things, like a small pan of cornbread, a small (Or just a deeper) peach cobbler, perhaps some camp taters (Canned sliced potatoes, bacon, onion, can of cream of mushroom, cheese), a side dish, something like that.Looking forward to', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 24, 2020', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Lodge quality - now go and cook!', 'author': 'Tezza', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I wanted to try out campfire cooking so I did a little research and purchased this Lodge dutch oven.Let me first say that I have bought other Lodge cast iron products and they are the ""Mercedes"" of cast iron cookware. No shortcuts here, just beautiful, functional cast iron products that can be passed down to your children or grandchildren. On to the review...The pot lid is very, very heavy. The pot itself is beautifully made. The instructions are clear (I recommend you follow them, they are correct). The iron handle is robust enough to take the pot off the fire filled hot food without giving you any concern.The pot is ""pre-seasoned"" so all you have to do is give it a quick clean. I usually clean my cast iron products using hot water, a soft plastic brush and a little salt. Not much sticks anyway, but the salt works to give the brush a little ""bite"", plus I think the salt helps the seasoning a little.The next step is to make a nice fire about 2 hours ahead of your cook time. The pot is NOT placed on the fire directly, but a few hot coals are dragged away from the fire for cooking.I place the pot over about 10 hot coals on the botton, and about 20 hot coals on the lid. I turn the lid every 15 minutes or so and replace the coals with new ones about every 45 minutes.Generally this method will cook a 4-5 pound chicken with a few potatoes, carrots and onions until it ""falls off the bone"" in about 3 hours.It\'s really hard to describe how chicken tastes after being cooked over fire coals. It seems to keep the character flavor of the pot from meal to meal, and tastes ever so slightly smoky. It\'s very similar to cooking I\'ve tasted in New Zealand where meat and vegetables are wrapped up on palm fronds, place over white hot stones, then buried for about four hours. It just has it\'s own unique flaor.I\'ve also cooked chile, leg of lamb and a number of other dishes. They\'ve all been great.A word of warning. Most people (including myself) can\'t believe that just a few coals below the pot, and double the number placed on top of the lid, can really cook the contents, but less is truly more in campfire cooking.If too many coals are used, the food will taste strangely overcooked, but not burned. So best to exercise much restraint.If you want to try campfire cooking and buy quality that can last for generations, then I say buy this quality pot and go out and cook!', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 15, 2008', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Great, but needed work', 'author': 'RnR', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'I bought a 12"" (8 qt) ""Used -- Very Good"" return to save a few bucks (Cast iron never wears out, right? It can ALWAYS be cleaned and re-seasoned). It arrived in brand-new, never-used condition, but it was obvious to me why it was returned once I opened it. The inside had a horrible sand-cast finish that almost looked like mill scale buildup on hot rolled steel. I was disappointed because I have high regards for Lodge Manufacturing and the products that they turn out. I don\'t know what standard they use to determine when a cast product is too rough and should be scrapped, but this one needed (at the very least) to be resurfaced on the inside of the bottom. The same roughness would have been fine on the outside or even the lid, but the bottom and sides should be smooth.I was too excited to get it and didn\'t want to waste time returning it, so I spent about 20-30 minutes scrubbing it with emory paper (starting with 80 grit and working down to 320) and it\'s fine now. Truth be told, the bottom is much smoother than the outisde now. Of course it needs to be re-seasoned, but having bought a used (return) in order to save money, I was planning on re-seasoning it anyway.Lodge makes great products; please don\'t let me give you the wrong impression on this DO. Aside from the casting errors in this particular DO, I was highly pleased. The wall thickness is plenty stout to endure camping life, yet not overly heavy. The legs are beefy and taper into the bottom with a generous blend. The lid fits beautifully and the pre-seasoning looks great for what it was intended. Had I not needed to resurface the bottom, I would easily give it 5 stars.

I think it was on sale too.I am happy with the purchase.Luckily, my pot was in good condition; no chipping, cracking, warping, denting or visible signs of uneven glazing. The 3qt. size is a good size for my weekly batch cooking. (Your mileage may vary) Since it is pretty heavy, this is also the limit at which I could lift and wash the vessel. Speaking of washing, this pot cleans so well. So far no burning, no sticking and any fond that has formed while cooking deglazes right away.I have cooked various rice (white, brown, wild, fried), pastas, lentil/bean soups, chicken tacos, braised chicken, paella, soda bread and even Moroccan chicken dish for tagine. As you can see from the line-up of food I made, this little dutch oven can take place of bunch of other cooking vessels. This versatile pot, along with my Instant Pot and beloved stainless steel pot set, will let me cook multiple dishes all at once. (That saves a lot of time for the weekend batch cooker)If I could make a request or two to Lodge, that would be, please make it lighter. It IS VERY heavy. And please consider making pots in the slightly shallower shapes too, but not as flat as a braiser. I totally love the round-ish profile of Lodge dutch ovens (much more than Le Creuset designs), but since I use a small oven, height of 5 1/2"" and above won\'t work well. For those dishes I need to keep the lid on while baked in the oven, I am currently using a Le Creuset pot.Overall, this product is nice to look at, reasonably priced and works very well and I recommend it.11/10/2020 Little Update:After months of daily use and it\'s still working great.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 31, 2020', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars These dutch ovens are totally worth it and they are awesome!', 'author': 'Omkara', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I have these Lodge dutch ovens in 3 quart, 4.5 quart, 6 quart and 7.5 quart. I also have the Lodge 3.6 quart cast iron enamel casserole pan. I have had these for about six months and I use them all the time.Lodge never claimed that these dutch ovens are made in America, their cast iron skillets and such are made in America, and I guess if where something is made is what determines whether you like an item, you will most likely not like this dutch oven. I am not sure what some of the reviewers are doing with these dutch ovens that they have started on fire or peeled and cracked really bad. I use my 6 quart dutch oven pretty much every other week and I use one of the others that I own weekly. I take care of them, I don't put them in the dishwasher, which is what causes the enamel to crack, I store them carefully, though I guess not too carefully as they are stacked together, and I don't wash them when they are still hot, but I don't let the food sit in them for extended periods either. I heat them up prior to putting food in them to cook, though I do use high temperatures at times. I put them in the oven almost every time I use them after starting on the stove.These dutch ovens have held up wonderfully and make the most wonderful meals for me and my family. I love them, and they are not super expensive. Seeing as I have five items from Lodge, if there was really something wrong with them, I would assume I would have experienced something by now with at least one of the ovens, and I have not. Don't put them in the dishwasher!! They will not hold up. These are truly wonderful dutch ovens. I make the best pot roasts, short ribs, chicken coq au vin, and more with them.I have made pot roast and beef stew in the 3 quart dutch oven, and it has come out so good, so don't pay attention to the people that say you can't do so with the smaller ovens. You 100% can. I make my elder parents food in the 3 quart all the time, and it the makes perfect amount for them to have a couple of dinners. The 3 quart is also great for baked ziti dishes, bread, and the like. This dutch oven is perfect for a single person to make magnificent meals in.The 4.5 quart dutch oven is also perfect for making pot roasts, stews, and such for a couple of people. It has a little more room than the 3 quart, making it perfect for two people.The 6 quart dutch oven is perfect for making food for my husband and I that we can eat for a few days. It is also great for making food when we have company over. This oven would be perfect for a family of four, though you could also make enough for six without leftovers.The 7.5 quart dutch oven is perfect for a large family. I use this when we are eating with my brother and his children, or we are having several couples over and want left overs. My husband loves leftovers.Finally though it is not in this listing, just as an FYI the 3.6 casserole is perfect for chicken coq au vin, and one pot chicken and rice, and dishes like those. I absolutely love that pan and I use it frequently. I make enough food for four people comfortably, five or six depending on portions. It can fit about 8 chicken thighs with skin and 1 pound baby potatoes or a cup of rice.I hope this helps. This is the only time I have ever written a review this long or detailed.

There is nothing like cooking in a cast iron dutch oven! Having enamel cover the entire pan makes it even better! It cleans ip easily! It is very heavy, but thst is what makes it cook better than other pans.The size is perfect!I made enough dumplings to feed 2 families!It holds more than i thought it would. I can cook a good size roast in it, with lots of potatoes, and vegetables. I will use this for Holidays, and company.I hope it holds up for years. I will update my review in a few months. So far it is great!The rims are enameled too! It is so hard to find an enameled cast iron pan with enameled rims, unless you want to spend a fortune. Good job, Lodge!!!I got the Oyster color. It is beautiful!!!I never use high heat...no need to. I use silicone utensils, and hand wash.Update...i have made so many meals, in this Dutch Oven. It holds soooooo much!!! Chili, Dumplings, Soup, and more! All it takes is a low heat. I start it out on low...3 on my electric stove. After 5 minutes, i turn it up to 4. Then a few minutes later i turn it up to Medium...5. It will come to a boil on 4, and 5. But after it comes to a boil, i turn it down to 3, or 4, because it holds the heat so well. It will keep boiling.Clean up? I still love how easily it cleans up! Stuck on sauce? Just wait til it cools down, add water for about 10 minutes. Then just wash it with some Polmolive Original dish liquid, (no citrus, or citric acid that can dull the shine of the enamel.). It washes like a china plate. Easy! Then i dry it, immediately. I let it sit, without the lid for an hour to air...then i out the little rubber guards on the pan, and put the lid on it. It looks beautiful, sitting out in my kitchen. This is my every day pan.

I also own a larger size 30-year old Le Creuset dutch oven, so I can compare the two. I\'m only going to address functionality, not the issue of it being made in China instead of the USA. I bought this to have a backup for smaller batches of food. I wanted something much less expensive than a Le Creuset but still sturdy and useful, and I was not disappointed. The pot did not come with any defects that I could find. After a year it is in excellent shape and I don\'t see any reason why it should not last for my lifetime. The Lodge pot is very good for browning and sauteing meats and vegetables, then transferring to the oven. I\'ve had excellent results every time with stews and braised meats. It also works well for round sourdough loaves. It\'s not so good for roasts, as only a small roast or chicken will fit. After a year, the Lodge pot is still clean and slick on the inside although there is now some very slight discoloration on the bottom and some scratching on the outside. When I take the pot out of the oven, I usually leave the lid on for about 20 minutes. This way, the steam gently dissolves any browning on the sides and bottom so I can scrape it all out with a spatula. This usually gets out all the ""fond."" If there is still anything left sticking, I fill the pot with water and let it soak a few hours, then I can scrub it out with a plastic scrubbing sponge. The pot goes in the dishwasher and I haven\'t observed any rusting on the edge of the lid so far. I use steel wool for burned on grease on the outside. I care for the pot by heating it slowly, and never letting it overheat, or warm up ""dry"" without oil or water in it. I only use silicone or wood spoons and spatulas in the pot. I never use scouring powder or steel wool to clean the inside. The Lodge\'s main drawback is that the bottom of the pot is too small. The sides curve downward so that the actual flat bottom that sits on the heating element is only 6 inches in diameter, while the diameter of the rim is 9.5 inches. You can only brown a small amount of meat at a time on this surface. I chose a smaller size deliberately but I was disappointed in this feature. The pot can only brown small batches of meat at one time. It is also rather heavy for its size, and yes, it heats unevenly unless you heat it slowly and thoroughly. The Le Creuset is still my favorite to cook with as it has a much larger bottom surface for its proportions, and distributes heat more evenly, although I still take care to heat it slowly. I can brown a much larger batch of meat in one go, and it\'s big enough to hold a roast pork loin or chicken. Also, the Lodge pot is almost as heavy as the Le Creuset although it is smaller, which can make it awkward to handle. On the other hand, the entire Le Creuset line is fabulously expensive (mine was a gift.) I just did not want to spend that much money for a backup pot.

I like how versatile Dutch ovens can be when cooking, and also how well they hold the heat, but the Dutch oven I had is just too large when cooking for only one or two people normally. This dutch oven is elegant looking, with a ripple embossed around the perimeter of the pan. The color of the pan I chose is called Martha Blue, which has a slight green tint added to the light blue color. The lid of the dutch oven fits tightly. The lid also is self basting, as it has a dimpled surface rather than a smooth one, which is something I really like, as it makes basting pretty much a thing of the past in this style of a dutch oven. Comparing Martha Stewart's Dutch Oven to a Le Creuset or Staub version, both of which I have used in the past, Martha Stewart's Dutch Oven seems to be slightly thinner than the others. That is not necessarily a detriment, as it makes the oven lighter in weight. The Martha Stewart 3 quart sized pan is still plenty heavy. Martha Stewart's Dutch oven is not dishwashable, whereas Le Creuset is. I do not remember what the dishwashing status was with Staub. Most noticeable however, and I took one star off my rating because of it - the glazing on the Martha Stewart Dutch oven is not applied as well as it is with Le Creuset or Staub. On the exterior of the Martha Stewart Dutch oven, the glaze is fine, but along the interior, just below the rim where the lid would rest, the glazing was both unevenly applied and thin. I can actually see a white glaze and then the interior glaze, which is more a creamy color that attempts to cover the white in all places, but does not quite make it over everything at the rim.. Other than the glazing, this is a nice Dutch oven for the price involved. It should last for years if careful with it.

I like cast iron and have a lot of it including two enameled cast iron Dutch ovens from well known brands (but they were actually made in China). I inherited one of them from my Dad and purchased the other before I knew about French enameled cast iron cookware in general and Staub in particular. My Dad and I had the idea to compare the two brands and both seemed to be of good quality and they lasted for years, but they were far from perfect -- the enamel on one of them was easily chipped and the interior of the other one developed cracking and the surface started to flake off. In the intervening years, I discovered Staub and started building up a collection; the quality of the materials and workmanship is amazing. They are beautifully finished with several layers of gorgeous enamel (that resists chipping) and they are very heavy with a durable matte black interior. The lids are self-basting. They are pricey so I would usually purchase a different piece for the holidays each year. Sort of a gift to myself. I have two of the figural pieces (the tomato and the pumpkin -- so charming! but useful, too) the medium-sized coq-au-vin, a 3.75 quart French oven and three of the Dutch ovens (4 quart, 5.5 quart and 7 quart). I thought my collection was complete, although I wouldn't have minded if someone gifted me the cute artichoke figural piece). Anyway, I had been using my Dad's Dutch oven as a designated pot for making yogurt, cream of wheat and oatmeal when I noticed the flaking. I liked using it for this purpose because it was taller than my Staub Dutch ovens. I was so happy to see that Staub had introduced a tall version of the 5-quart Dutch oven, and I ordered it in the matte black. It looks great and It is perfect for so many things -- yogurt, of course but also soups and stews or baking bread. The size is versatile and it is just right for smaller families. The price was $199.99 when I purchased mine, and I thought that was a good deal. I have been looking for a Christmas gift for my SIL (a great cook) and I see they are now only $149.99! I also see there are great new colors available, too! This Dutch oven is definitely worth the price as Staub enameled cast iron is gorgeously finished, well-made, robust and durable + everything I make in these pots come out flavorful and delicious. It is 10 times better than the less expensive enameled cast iron I previously used. My older ones still look brand new.

During long Great Lakes winters, I make a weekly mega-batch of veggie soup out of bulk-purchased, dried veggies long-simmered in stock, aromatics, olive oil, and spices over low heat for 12 to 18 hours. Critically, at several junctures during this process, I add ample lemon and/or lime juice to help tenderize the rehydrating veggies, brighten and deepen the soup's flavors, and keep my salt usage low.This penchant for long-simmered, citrus-accented soup creates specific cookware needs -- as I discovered almost 10 years ago, when I banished all Teflon-coated cookware from my kitchen for a minimalist, gradually-assembled collection of stainless steel, raw cast iron, carbon steel, and enameled cast iron. I soon learned that while stainless steel and enameled cast iron are generally non-reactive when cooking with acidic ingredients, independent cookware studies and cookware manufacturers' guidance caution that long-simmered recipes heavy on acidic ingredients can cause stainless steel vessels to pit or leach.Thus, back in 2013, I took advantage of an online cookware retailer's clearance sale to snag a ginormous, 9 Quart Staub Cocotte for my weekly mega-batches of citrus-laced veggie soup. Alas, in recent years, having left my office job to work from home, I've found myself wanting to make smaller batches of soup for which my witch's-cauldron-sized, 9 Quart Staub Cocotte -- while still chip-free, rust-free, and gorgeous after nearly a decade of regular use -- is often too capacious, too unwieldy, or too covetous of stovetop real estate when I’m using other burners simultaneously.Enter Staub's 5 Quart Tall Cocotte -- Staub’s first stockpot-shaped cocotte -- which I purchased in Matte Black in 2021 (after a 2-year wait for a sale price) because it mimics the slim, space-saving form-factor of my favorite stainless-steel stockpot (i.e. Cuisinart 6-Quart Stockpot w/Cover, Stainless Steel ), sans stainless steel’s susceptibility to pit or leach when subjected to my citrus-laced soups week after week.And although I initially worried that its unfinished-feeling handles -- which are much rougher to the touch than those of my other Staub enameled cast iron products -- sported exposed cast iron (as many other online consumers have also wondered), the 5 Quart Tall Cocotte’s handles have indeed proved coated with a durable sealant as sturdy and non-reactive as those on its smooth-handled, Staub 9 Quart Cocotte big sister. No chips, rusting, or wear during the past 14 months of weekly lemony soup nirvana. Score!With the volume of Staub's 4 Quart Cocotte a little too small for my needs, and the squat dimensions of Staub's 5.5 Quart Cocotte wider and lower than the slim, high-sided profile I wanted in a midsized cocotte, Staub's 5 Quart Tall Cocotte provides a 'Goldilocks' form-factor I’ve found ‘just right.’ YMMV.TL;DR UPSHOT:IMHO after 14 months of regular use of Staub’s 5 Quart Tall Cocotte, this characteristically durable, versatile, and acidic-ingredient-impervious cocotte is unique enough -- with a form-factor found nowhere else in Staub’s enameled cast iron line -- that even folks who already own Staub cocottes of other capacities/shapes might consider adding the 5 Quart Tall to their kitchen arsenals.

The surface inside is difficult to clean and not dishwasher safe, or at least not recommended. Has to be cleaned by hand and without any abrasives. They'll remove the interior coating which is rough and therefore not easy to clean. The interior coating is also black, meaning it is very difficult to gauge braising or opacity without a light directly overhead. The handles are cast iron and the lid knob is metal. Do not grab either when in service without a pot holder of some kind. If you do, it will be a memorable experience.I have not seen where this $400 pot cooks any better than any of my other cast iron, they are generally easier to clean and the other casseroles have a light colored interior making it much easier to see what is going on in there.While this may be left to someone in a last will and testament, I doubt it would be much more appreciated than any well maintained cast iron vessels, unless the recipient was a cast iron snob or a demanding gourmet chef that truly appreciated its capability and good looks despite its feature shortcomings.I have found after a number of months mine sets in an honored space along with some other shockingly priced cookware while lesser names easier to clean and handle provide the day to day cookery."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 16, 2021', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Love this piece', 'author': 'rosalyn', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'On top the the black interior and design of cover that keeps steam water inside, the tall body is a space saver, for storage, for space on stove and when serving on table.

The two other enameled pans I compare in this review are Le Creuset and Lodge.I really like cooking on enamel iron pans because of durability, ease of cleaning, and not having to worry about the chemicals in non-stick pans. But to prevent sticking, one should use lower flames than one might be used to with other kinds of pans. Iron retains heat and gets hotter than other types of pans, which causes burning and sticking. And one must coat with oil after heating and before putting the food in the pan.Shape - The Cuisinart bottom is perfectly flat, whereas the center of the Lodge pan is slightly raised (imagine a dome that has been almost completely flattened, but is not perfectly flat). Consequently, the Cuisinart is better than the Lodge for cooking omelettes because eggs gravitate to the perimeter of the Lodge and might not cook evenly.Shape - The Cuisinart bottom intersects the wall of the pan at an angle. The same is true for the Lodge. In contrast, the Le Creuset bottom rises gradually upwards to form the wall, so food won't get caught at the edge of the Le Creuset. Depending on your cooking technique, you might prefer one shape over the other.Weight-wise, the Cuisinart and Le Creuset are manageable, and the Lodge is very heavy (it is a workout to wash and dry).Durability - the enamel is chipping on the handle of the Lodge, but not on the cooking surfaces, where it matters most. So it's unsightly, but it does not affect functionality. There is no chipping with the other pans.Price - the Cuisinart and the Lodge were each about a third the price of the Le Creuset."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 29, 2012', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great little Dutch oven', 'author': 'Rick Bledsoe', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I got this in a 3 quart size because my others were just too big for some tasks.

These enameled cast iron dutch ovens are invaluable for cooking virtually anything on the wood stove, an induction cook top, gas, and electric radiant cook top. On warmer days when we don't have the wood stove going, I use this on the glass cook top on low as a slow cooker or oven.This is a very hard-to-get size. Basically, only Lodge and Le Creuset make this size. For the price, this is definitely the logical choice. I own quite a bit of enameled cast iron from various brands and have never had problems with the Lodge pieces. I can't understand why anyone would spring for several hundred dollars when the same thing is so much more affordable from Lodge. The only improvement is I wish Lodge used other colors in this size. That's what Le Creuset has over other manufacturers. Greens? Yellows? Oranges? Purples? The jewel tones would be so pretty sitting out on an exposed shelf in the kitchen.As far as the Lodge dutch oven, all the things that make a difference are there:-the bottom is flat, not rough so it won't scratch the glass cook top-the bottom of the dutch oven has a large ratio of cook surface for the volume (as opposed to the cute but illogical apple oven that Lodge makes) so the heating is faster-the bottom is flat, not concave, for more even heating (a concave bottom is useless, even harmful, on glass cook tops)-the lid sits snugly on the oven and doesn't rock so steam doesn't escape during cooking with the food drying out-handles are sufficient for grasping-the enameled surface allows me to cook more acidic foods, like tomato bases, and white foods, like rice or quinoa, without staining the food-the size is just right for soup for two, rice, reheating leftovers, two cans of corn, etc.It's heavy, of course. You hope it's heavy because it's not iron if it isn't. Iron IS heavy - check the periodic table of elements. It'll save that trip to the gym for the reps on the arms.Meanwhile, remember that the enamel is basically glass which shatters if there is a quick change in temperature. The iron and enamel expand and contract at different rates so warm it with warm water before putting it on a very hot surface, like a hot stove, if you don't want small cracks in the surface. If the inside stains, it's from a strongly colored food entering the small fissures that you created when changing the temperature too quickly. I've recently discovered a great cleaner for these pots - the Kohler cast iron sink cleaner works miracles on the stains in these pots!! Amazing!After removing all of the contents, initially soak it with water that is a similar temperature. ALL enameled cast iron needs this precaution, the brand doesn't matter.

The box says 5.25qts (now the smallest Dutch oven style Scanpan makes but out of stock on their website) but the pot itself that I ordered directly from Amazon is 4qts. I filled it with water and it's 4 qts to within an inch of the top.I have some Scanpan cookware that I have had for years. Frying pans lasted at least five years - pans we used every day. But it was time to replace the big stock pot and the 3.5-qt Dutch oven. The 3.5qt with the double handles is no longer made, so I looked for a replacement and did a lot of research on non-stick cookware. Even though I have a great stainless set, I'm not making my holiday cranberry sauce in anything but non-stick.Scanpan still gets the highest marks for durability in reviews, and now with improved coatings. Most important, it's quality cookware. I've had it with my husband coming home with pans from the junk closeout stores that last a month, especially when he uses high heat and metal utensils. I told him - no more new pans for you until you mend your ways, and he has.I will say that it's probably not quite as hefty as the pans I bought 15 years ago, but still very well made and sturdy. I tested its heat distribution: perfectly even bubbles when boiling water. No hot or cold spots anywhere. It also retains heat extremely well. Even my husband noticed that he had to turn down the heat after it was completely heated. My husband's chili was beautifully evenly cooked. And everything slides right out. I've hidden all the metal utensils and I make sure he doesn't go over medium heat. No matter what any non-stick cookware manufacturers tell you, NO metal, NO heat over medium, and hand wash. These are the keys to long lasting non-stick cookware.We originally bought our Scanpan cookware at a really true closeout store, and I didn't even know it was still sold in America.

The finish is really smooth and glossy. I was hesitant to use it on my glass ceramic cooktop, but after receiving the product I am not worried that it will scratch or damage anything because the bottom is flat and perfect. My main intention is to use it in the oven to make chilis, stews, pot roasts, pot pies, or for baking bread (I want to try sourdough). I think it will be great for these foods. I made chili with chicken in it and it worked very well, with really nice even heating and nothing got burned.It is very heavy and feels very durable. Since it is cast iron underneath the enamel coating you do have to be careful in two ways. One, you don’t want to scratch the coating and two, if you drop this pot it could definitely break other dishes. Also it says to be careful not to shock it with abrupt temperature changes. Since I am using this for larger cooking items like stews for in the oven, I got the 7.5 QT oval size, but if you are cooking for only 1 or 2 people or not making large quantities I think the smaller round version would fit better on the cooktop and be easier to handle because it would have a smaller size and weight. This product is so sturdy that I think I will be able to use it for many, many years. It also cleaned up really easily with no issues.So to sum up this seems to be a great quality product and at a great price. And the amazing color makes it beautiful looking too!

Like pretty much everyone else, I ogle over Le Creusets and their beauty out of the cabinets on everyone else’s stoves. The warmth and colors- and of course the mouthwatering food they produce. I couldn’t justify the expense, and most of the other brands either didn’t fit my style, or had a knob I knew I would have to replace for use in the oven… then I saw this one.The color, quality, pattern and lack of a brand on the top really set it apart from the other off brands available. The turquoise color and lid design match our eclectic Southwestern decor seamlessly. The price was perfect for what I’m willing to spend right now. So even with my lack of knowledge on the Spice brand- the small 20+ amount of 5 star reviews convinced me this was a purchase I could take a risk on.Boy does this baby cook! I have an Always Pan and an Instant Pot that I do most of my cooking in- the real downside is that neither of those can go in the oven. Even with the crisp attachment on the instant pot- I never get that dreamy bubbling crust I crave from cheesy casserole dishes- and I really hate using multiple pots and pans for 1 meal especially on a weeknight. This is the solution! I can do EVERYTHING in this pot and then put it in the oven. The first thing I made was a chicken broccoli bake- and even though my photo isn’t the prettiest to look at- it was TASTY! Evenly cooked all the way through, with a beautiful cheesy crust. Yum! We have a roommate at the moment who isn’t always home at the same time- even an hour and a half after taking it out of stove it was still warm for him!***UPDATE***Cooked a whole chicken and Brussels Sprouts dinner in 1 pot! The chicken was PERFECT! I think I’ll skip doing whole chickens in the instant pot and just use this 😋😋I’m a super happy satisfied camper. I will be buying these as gifts at this price for weddings and holidays! I don’t even think I’ll register for a Le Creuset after this! I’ve never personally cooked with the one- but I really can’t see there being a huge difference with how even this cooked.I can’t wait to make bread, braise, make soups, pot roast, deep fry…. Etc!Would highly recommend to anyone! The quality is exceptional and the value for money is on point!***UPDATED AFTER USE OVER A MONTH OR 2***This Dutch oven has been an every other day use item since I got it. I do love it- the food is phenomenal. However the paint is starting to wear and chip on the outside. It doesn’t really bother me. The product still performs. I won’t change the star on it unless the inner white enamel starts to chip.I’m very pleased with food that has come out of it- just did a 4 lb pork shoulder inside on a weekday! I still leave it on the stove- even with the chips. It hasn’t been dropped or washed any harder than a heavy cast iron pan would be. I consider myself to be pretty strong in terms of holding it up- but haven’t had to really scrub it.I bought the turquoise one- which chipped maybe a month or 2 after I bought it.I would still recommend this product… just might not buy it for someone else… or pass it down.

Like pretty much everyone else, I ogle over Le Creusets and their beauty out of the cabinets on everyone else’s stoves. The warmth and colors- and of course the mouthwatering food they produce. I couldn’t justify the expense, and most of the other brands either didn’t fit my style, or had a knob I knew I would have to replace for use in the oven… then I saw this one.The color, quality, pattern and lack of a brand on the top really set it apart from the other off brands available. The turquoise color and lid design match our eclectic Southwestern decor seamlessly. The price was perfect for what I’m willing to spend right now. So even with my lack of knowledge on the Spice brand- the small 20+ amount of 5 star reviews convinced me this was a purchase I could take a risk on.Boy does this baby cook! I have an Always Pan and an Instant Pot that I do most of my cooking in- the real downside is that neither of those can go in the oven. Even with the crisp attachment on the instant pot- I never get that dreamy bubbling crust I crave from cheesy casserole dishes- and I really hate using multiple pots and pans for 1 meal especially on a weeknight. This is the solution! I can do EVERYTHING in this pot and then put it in the oven. The first thing I made was a chicken broccoli bake- and even though my photo isn’t the prettiest to look at- it was TASTY! Evenly cooked all the way through, with a beautiful cheesy crust. Yum! We have a roommate at the moment who isn’t always home at the same time- even an hour and a half after taking it out of stove it was still warm for him!***UPDATE***Cooked a whole chicken and Brussels Sprouts dinner in 1 pot! The chicken was PERFECT! I think I’ll skip doing whole chickens in the instant pot and just use this 😋😋I’m a super happy satisfied camper. I will be buying these as gifts at this price for weddings and holidays! I don’t even think I’ll register for a Le Creuset after this! I’ve never personally cooked with the one- but I really can’t see there being a huge difference with how even this cooked.I can’t wait to make bread, braise, make soups, pot roast, deep fry…. Etc!Would highly recommend to anyone! The quality is exceptional and the value for money is on point!***UPDATED AFTER USE OVER A MONTH OR 2***This Dutch oven has been an every other day use item since I got it. I do love it- the food is phenomenal. However the paint is starting to wear and chip on the outside. It doesn’t really bother me. The product still performs. I won’t change the star on it unless the inner white enamel starts to chip.I’m very pleased with food that has come out of it- just did a 4 lb pork shoulder inside on a weekday! I still leave it on the stove- even with the chips. It hasn’t been dropped or washed any harder than a heavy cast iron pan would be. I consider myself to be pretty strong in terms of holding it up- but haven’t had to really scrub it.I bought the turquoise one- which chipped maybe a month or 2 after I bought it.I would still recommend this product… just might not buy it for someone else… or pass it down.

The box says 5.25qts (now the smallest Dutch oven style Scanpan makes but out of stock on their website) but the pot itself that I ordered directly from Amazon is 4qts. I filled it with water and it's 4 qts to within an inch of the top.I have some Scanpan cookware that I have had for years. Frying pans lasted at least five years - pans we used every day. But it was time to replace the big stock pot and the 3.5-qt Dutch oven. The 3.5qt with the double handles is no longer made, so I looked for a replacement and did a lot of research on non-stick cookware. Even though I have a great stainless set, I'm not making my holiday cranberry sauce in anything but non-stick.Scanpan still gets the highest marks for durability in reviews, and now with improved coatings. Most important, it's quality cookware. I've had it with my husband coming home with pans from the junk closeout stores that last a month, especially when he uses high heat and metal utensils. I told him - no more new pans for you until you mend your ways, and he has.I will say that it's probably not quite as hefty as the pans I bought 15 years ago, but still very well made and sturdy. I tested its heat distribution: perfectly even bubbles when boiling water. No hot or cold spots anywhere. It also retains heat extremely well. Even my husband noticed that he had to turn down the heat after it was completely heated. My husband's chili was beautifully evenly cooked. And everything slides right out. I've hidden all the metal utensils and I make sure he doesn't go over medium heat. No matter what any non-stick cookware manufacturers tell you, NO metal, NO heat over medium, and hand wash. These are the keys to long lasting non-stick cookware.We originally bought our Scanpan cookware at a really true closeout store, and I didn't even know it was still sold in America. Of course, I can't attest if it will last over a decade like my original Scanpan cookware.

But, I wanted something that would fit a large roast or meal because I like cooking for my whole family. Even if it's just the two of us, I like cooking extra so I can freeze some. I've been looking specifically at this pan & wanted to buy it when the price was around $60. But, I needed other things at the time. This was a want, not a necessity. Then the price started going up to over $70. I found this offered by Amazon for $42 because the original packaging was damaged. But, the pan is brand new. It arrived & the Lodge box was in one piece but had been taped in several places. The pan was in perfect condition. I took the chance because Amazon would take the pan back if I wasn't happy with it. The pan is well made as are my other Lodge pans. I like using this brand because it is made in the US & I don't have to worry about questionable metals being used. The handle really makes it easy to lift the cover. I'm still getting used to cooking with cast iron. But, having this size pan will make it possible to cook larger items or large one pan meals. The pan is quite heavy. I'm 60 yrs old, female, & not in the best shape of my life right now. But, I can still lift the pan to use it. Of course, it will be even heavier when full. Still, I'm sure I'll be able to lift it. Just be aware that if you don't have arm strength, you might find this a bit difficult to maneuver. That said, it'll be worth it. I cooked fried chicken in it the other day. My chicken came out perfect & the pan cleaned up in a breeze. I've slowly been purchasing different Lodge cast iron pans as I have found that many things I cook come out better in the cast iron pans. Also, even though the pans are preseasoned, I season them 2 more times just to be safe. Foods rarely stick to the pans. When they do, I use the small scraper & brush that come in the Lodge Seasoned Cast Iron Care Kit Red Hot Handle Holder. I also use a cast iron chainmail cleaner. The pans are so much easier to clean than my expensive hard anodized nonstick Circulon pans or my stainless steel pans w/ copper bottoms. My daughter, son-in-law, & 2 grandkids love to go camping. They love using cast iron to cook over a campfire. My son-in-law was amazed at the price I paid for this pan on Amazon. It retails on the Lodge website for $120.

I have been wanting a cast ion mortar and pestle and so far the largest one I have found is 16-ounces and I ended up ordering it. The pestle is great -- very heavy and solid and it is very sturdy. However, the mortar doesn't quite measure up -- it seems rather small in comparison to the pestle and it is also considerably lighter in weight than I expected + the sides and base are fairly thin (for cast iron, anyway). I thought this Dutch oven might make a good substitute for the mortar even though it doesn't have the usual rounded bottom. It works perfectly! And the entire construction is very heavy and robust with very thick sides and base. This will be useful for so many other things, too. I like the cute shape and I'll be using it for butter on baking day, for BBQ sauce when grilling and it is excellent for small meals for just one. I like the heavy-duty lid, too; it has a flat top to allow coals to be placed on it if the oven is to be nestled in a campfire and there is a ridge around the inner circumference to help keep it in place, but still allow enough movement so I can actually open it when I want to. The logo and little loop handle has a charming, vintage look, too. Of course, being made of cast iron, this will need occasional seasoning. The price is fantastic, as well.

Be sure not to overheat as well - pay attention to the max amt of heat you should use and that also protects the non-stick qualities - I had to get used to cooking at a lower temp than I had before but got used to it. I bought some felt to put between pots for storage to protect the finish from small scratches and also take care to put it in a place in the drainer where sharp items won't scratch. Seems like a lot to protect them but these easy habits forms quickly and makes cooking/cleanup so much easier. Pots were a little pricey but so glad I got them - with proper care, I believe they will last a good long time and the ceramic coating seems to be one of the healthiest options for non-stick cookware.One caveat - you might want a different dedicated pot for cooking pasta that you could put on higher heat - takes a long time to heat up a large pot of water with the lower temp requirement for this series."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 17, 2022', 'is_verified': True}]"

It is approximately 8 1/4 inches in diameter (2 Qt. And sufficient for 1 to 3 people), made of aluminum single piece construction, where the handles are not bolted on but rather part of the unibody cast in one piece, which means that they get very hot when you’re cooking. The pot has sharp edges, a rough embossed bottom, which will definitely scratch any glass-top cooking surface, and the lid has a screw-on knob (plastic ?) that never gets hot during cooking. The pot arrived wrapped in plastic with minor grease stains on the inside of the lid and pot. This is clearly not a premium product, but it is affordable and works acceptably well. Even though I seasoned the pot with a light coating of oil and letting it heat up, twice, there was still a bit of sticking of the rice. This is fairly typical and not a problem. Whatever doesn’t come out in the serving, will be loosened by letting it soak overnight with a bit of water. Although I am not happy with the rough finish and scratchy bottom of the pot, it does work really well. It is good values for money IF YOU TAKE THE TIME TO SEASON the pot. Seasoning the caldero does help the cooking process and you will get less sticking. I have cooked traditional “rice and beans” twice with it with great results.

Wash the Dutch oven and lid with warm soapy water with non abrasive scrub pad to remove all manufacturing residue, rinse with warm clean water then dry with a clean, white lint free rag. Failing to use a lint free rag will result in the fabric threads getting stuck to the coarse pan metal finish. If you fail to follow these directions you will be shellacking all the excess fabric threads into the pan when it seasons in the oven. Start from scratch to remove if this happens. Preheat oven to 350 and place a sheet of tin foil on the rack below to catch residue.Once you have cleaned and dryer the Dutch oven, take a clean lint free rag, dip it in olive or grape seed oil and wipe on a thin sheen of oil on the inside of the Dutch oven, lip and handles. Make numerous passes to ensure you get the oil into all the pores. There should not be any oil dripping off this pan when done. Flip the Dutch oven over and wipe a thin sheen of oil on the bottom and sides of the Dutch oven and ensure you apply to the bottom of the handles also. Repeat this same process over on the top and bottom of the lid. Putting on a thick layer of oil will result in a very sticky finish on the Dutch oven. When done open the oven and place the Dutch oven on its top with the bottom facing up. Set the lid with handle up next to Dutch oven. Set time for one hour and allow pan to season. Once this has completed, leave the oven closed and allow the Dutch oven to cool to room temperature in the oven. Take the Dutch oven out and repeat the seasoning and heating process twice more always ending with a thin sheen of oil prior to placing back in oven. You are now ready to use this Dutch oven for cooking.To clean, wipe out excess food residue and cooking oil from the Dutch oven and lid using clean paper towels. DO NOT USE water or soap to clean your pan after cooking. You will destroy the seasoning.

It could be used to cook a variety of dishes, but I wanted this pan for when I braise my meat in the oven. Typically I brown it on the stove top and then move it to the oven to slowly braise. I like that I can use the same pan for the stove top and the oven. I also prefer to use cast iron. This cast iron is coated with a white enamel. I will need to learn how to care for this, but it is nice to be able to have the enamel because I can cook tomato products without damaging the cast iron. I did realize that I need to not use metal utensils with the enamel. I already use wooden spoons and spatulas. I found the Dutch oven heated very evenly on the stove top. My food did not stick to the pan. It was very easy to clean. The crusted material on the sides from the roast being braised for 2 hours easily wiped off. I did end up slightly staining the white enamel with my red wine and tomato sauce. I like that I don’t have to worry about the pan rusting like I do with my iron skillets. It says it is dishwasher safe, but does not recommend it. I have decided I will only hand wash mine. The Cukor Cast Iron Dutch Oven is a great option. It looks like and performs like the pricier brands of enameled cast iron Dutch Ovens. The Cukor Cast Iron Dutch Oven is very reasonably priced. I am very happy with my purchase and would buy this again.

My internet research found that a lot of people seem to have either Lodge or Camp Chef cast-iron on all the camping forums. I picked this one because I like the lid that doubles as a griddle and also because the price was better than Lodge. I do like that Lodge is made in the U.S., but I wish they were more competitively priced. A 12 quart lodge dutch oven was double the cost of this one. And as I said, I like the legs on the Camp Chef lid.I was afraid that 12 quarts might be too big, but the lid actually accounts for about 3 of those quarts, so the pot is only about 9 quarts which is a perfect size for me. It was pre-seasoned and the first thing I made was a cobbler. Clean up was easy. After cleaning I heated it on my grill to dry it and then rubbed some more oil all over it. A few days later I wanted to test how well the lid worked as a griddle. The legs on the lid let me sit it right on the coals and I made some bacon and eggs. I cooked the bacon first and the lid held a whole pound of it. After that I drained the bacon grease and fried a half dozen eggs and there was no trouble with sticking. Again, clean up was a breeze. While still warm I wiped it out with some water and a small scrub brush. Re-oiled it and it's ready for my next meal."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 11, 2010', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Good product, can be added more additional products for sale', 'author': 'Goodman', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Good product.

It was not preseasoned (an essential process with cast iron in which you coat the product with cooking oil, place in an oven and turn it on to 350 degrees.

I waited until it arrived to confirm this before I acquired a digital thermometer to help me monitor the internal temperature of the oven. There are many good sites on-line that discuss how to control the temperature but I felt that being new to this method of cooking a thermometer would help until I get used to it. The pot is well built, pre-seasoned and ready to go right out of the box. It was also an excellent price compared to other brands I looked at.

So far I\'ve used it serveral times, and have cooked a variety of meals in it. Its performance thus far has been great. It holds heat very well, and is solidly constructed. I was a little disappointed to see that it was manufactured in China, but I should have researched before. With that said, it performs on par with it\'s ""Lodge"" counterparts as I also own a Lodge 8qt. and a 6qt. dutch oven. Plus you\'ll save between 20-40 dollars with this purchase over the Lodge products. This dutch oven is slightly thinner than it\'s Lodge counterparts though, but I\'m not sure if it\'s a quality issue, or if all 12qt.\'s and higher have slightly thinner walls. The slightly thinner wall doesn\'t seem to be an issue though, as again, it does hold heat in very well. It comes \'pre-seasoned\' but as I do with all my new or used cast iron, I go ahead and give it a good scrub down with an abrasive brillo pad and a little Dawn liquid soap and re-cure it myself. I know there are some who will scoff, or react in horror at doing this, but I\'ve cooked with cast iron for well over 20 yrs and as long as you give it a good scrub, and then rinse it clean, then promply dry it with a towel then add another light coat of veggie shortening or oil, you will have no problems with pitting or rust. The top of this dutch oven has a nice retainer lip for hot coals to be placed on top for even heat distribution and has a good sturdy lifting ring that\'s well balanced. It can even be turned upside down to make a nice cooking griddle for pancakes or eggs and even has its own support pegs for this purpose My box also came with a new lifting tool, so there\'s no need to purchase one if you don\'t already have one. It\'s plenty big enough to cook a full sized chicken and all the sides. You could probably even cook a young turkey in it too, if you split it in half, and lay the halves down flat. I hauled this in for a little over 50 bucks and so far it has been worth every penny. In fact, if I was only going to own one dutch oven, this would be the one. If I ever find myself in a ""bug-out"" survival/flee situation...This dutch oven will come with me.

I love the legs molded into the lid, and the depth of the lid. (very handy) It dwarfs my 12 inch Lodge dutch oven. The design in the lid is a nice perk, but if anything, it probably makes the lid weaker. I still like it though.I don\'t have a caliber handy, but going by feel, I believe the Lodge is slightly thicker. I also noticed the Camp Chef does not seem to be an even thickness all the way around. Defiantly a quality issue. It may be my imagination, but the cast iron doesn\'t feel as solid as the Lodge dutch oven. All things being equal I would go with the Lodge which is American made, but they aren\'t equal. The Lodge is considerably more expensive so I am happy with my purchase. If the Camp Chef cracks on me, or food burns easily, I\'ll change my tune in a hurry, but I don\'t think it will, and the design with legs built into the lid, is so much better than the basic Lodge design. I like the Grand Canyon casting in the lid even though it is simple, it adds charm to the pot. I now have a 10"", two 12"" and the new Camp Chef which is 14"". At this point I would give it two thumbs up, but only 4 stars because it does feel a little thinner, and being a bigger pot it should be slightly thicker than the 12"". If you can afford the Lodge go with it, but if you\'re on a budget like me, I think the Camp Chef is a good value.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States July 11, 2012', 'is_verified': True}]"

Once the bacon cooked down, I was able to move the food around with ease.After the bacon was fully cooked and the skillet was still hot (please use oven mitts), I took tongs and a paper towel and rubbed the bacon fat all over the inside of the skillet and the lid. You can also use vegetable oil to wipe down the skillet – I chose to use bacon because…well, it’s bacon.I placed the skillet and lid upside down on the oven rack and set the timer for one hour. Be advised: the oven does get smoky so don’t be alarmed.Once the hour was up, I turned off the oven and let the pan cooled a bit before removing the skillet.Cleaning the skillet:It is easier to clean the skillet when it is still a bit warm, but please use cautionUsing Morton’s sea salt and a paper towel I began to scrub the skillet (you can also use a raw potato and sea salt)Once clean I rinsed out the skillet and immediately put it on low heat for about 2 minutes to evaporate any waterStore in a cool, dry place to prevent rustingA couple of notes:NEVER submerge a cast iron skillet in water as it will cause rust)NEVER use soapNEVER put a cast iron skillet in the dishwasherIf you do have rust – use steel wool to scour and remove the rust.

The enameled interior of the pot is smooth and that makes it easy to clean. The lid fits snugly to the pot which helps retain heat and minimize evaporation. This helps me to simmer and braise veggies in a moist environment at a lower temperature to help retain more nutrients. A Dutch oven with a tight-fitting lid is ideal for braising because it allows the food to cook slowly and evenly in a moist environment.I use this pan on my induction burner which allows perfect control of the temperature and turns it into an excellent slow cooker (and it also makes a wonderful bean pot). It\'s the perfect companion pot for my induction cooker, but it has the added versatility of working on my other cooktops and it even goes right into the oven!I decided to try this pot out by making my favorite braised and roasted potatoes. I sauteed a minced shallot and some chopped scallions and garlic cloves in a few tablespoons of olive oil and butter with a few skewers of Rosemary briefly, then I added some baby red potatoes, browned them for a few moments, then I covered the pan, tossing the potatoes to be sure they were well coated with the olive oil herb mixture.I transferred the pan to a 350F oven to finish the potatoes, covered, for an hour or so or until fork-tender. Then I removed the cover to brown for 15 minutes at 425F. Can I say ""Yum""? This cooking method is really only possible in a cast iron Dutch oven like this, and the M-Cooker 4 quart Dutch oven is the perfect size for this dish.It works equally well for steaming potatoes in their jackets for making perfect potato salad because steamed in this pan with their jackets on, potatoes retain all the flavor and nutrients that are lost when potatoes are peeled and boiled!

The stainless steel is not of the best quality and thickness of say a more expensive well polished heavy weight stainless steel pot. For higher quality think of the inner pot of an Instant Pot is you are familiar with that appliance.A close up view of the pot will show a “brushed” stainless look rather than a perfect smooth finish. The magnified views on the amazon product page will show this.***** SIZESome reviewers mention this pot is too small. It could be depending on the intended usage. The product page clearly states the oil capacity is 3.65 quarts so the size should not be a surprise. In my opinion the pot will only work for a one or two person meal unless you want to cook multiple batches.Some notes on the pot dimensions. The product page says the dimensions are \'16.25""D x 8.25""W x 6.75""H\': * The 16.25D inches is the end of the long handle to the outer edge of the half round handle. See photos 1 and 2. * The 8.25W inches is from the edge of the pot to the half round handle. The actual cooking diameter is about 6-1/2 inches inches. See photo 1. * The 6.75H is the height of the bottom of the pot to the top of the long handle. The actual cooking height is about 5-1/2 inches. See photo 3.Basket Dimensions: * The diameter of the basket is about 6 inches. See photo 4. * The height of the basket including the “feet” is about 4-1/2 inches. The usable height is about 4-1/8 inches. See photo 5.***** CLEANINGOur first try was fries from fresh potatoes. No problem with the fries.Our second use was frozen fish fillets. A “burnt” (?) residue was left on the sides of the pot. See photo 6. I was able to easily clean using a scratch resistant pad and Bar Keepers Friend. See photo 7. The residue came off with hardly any effort as shown in photo 1. I will admit we made a mistake and overloaded the basket with the fish and I don\'t know if this would have made a difference.Note on my attached photos: the pot as shown was after only cleaning off the residue so any other crap still on it will be taken care of by the dishwasher.Keep in mind highly polished stainless steel will clean easier than the “brushed” type.

It could be used to cook a variety of dishes, but I wanted this pan for when I braise my meat in the oven. Typically I brown it on the stove top and then move it to the oven to slowly braise. I like that I can use the same pan for the stove top and the oven. I also prefer to use cast iron. This cast iron is coated with a white enamel. I will need to learn how to care for this, but it is nice to be able to have the enamel because I can cook tomato products without damaging the cast iron. I did realize that I need to not use metal utensils with the enamel. I already use wooden spoons and spatulas. I found the Dutch oven heated very evenly on the stove top. My food did not stick to the pan. It was very easy to clean. The crusted material on the sides from the roast being braised for 2 hours easily wiped off. I did end up slightly staining the white enamel with my red wine and tomato sauce. I like that I don’t have to worry about the pan rusting like I do with my iron skillets. It says it is dishwasher safe, but does not recommend it. I have decided I will only hand wash mine. The Cukor Cast Iron Dutch Oven is a great option. It looks like and performs like the pricier brands of enameled cast iron Dutch Ovens. The Cukor Cast Iron Dutch Oven is very reasonably priced.

Let these things cool all the way down. My experience has been you need to be kind to them ( not over heating them... using proper utensils when cooking with them), and know if yu bang & clang them around with other pots & pans they will chip. So long as the chips are on the outside, no worries dry them good put a smidgen of oil on some outside cast showing to prevent rust....if big chips on the inside, well then you may want to plant flowers in it .... but if your good to them, 97% of them hold up fine.I do not use metal utensils in them ( only silicone or wood) and one Dutch oven is my 1st from 4 yrs ago (Lodge) not a chip and not a hazing crack or scratch on the inside and these types of pots /pans yu can get a good sear on fleshy proteins with medium heat and my chuck roasts ( pot roast ) never stick & come out with a great crust/ sear on them.All of these CN enamel cast iron dutch ovens big or small in my experience simmer beautifully on medium low after 30 mins with the lid on.I couldnt be happier.. :-)', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 12, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect for two people.', 'author': 'HJS', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Very well made, and heavy.

I got it because our son went off to college and I no longer had to cook for him and his entourage (lovely kids, all, but a hungry bunch). I love making one pot meals for my husband and myself, and thought this little Dutch oven would come in handy. It has. I’ve made some chicken fricassee and some lamb stew in it, both of which turned out terrifically well. The lid of this Dutch oven has a precise fit, so steam doesn’t escape, and the lid is also spiked, which allows the moisture from the food to drip back onto the food, thereby basting it.But the oven has two applications that hadn’t occurred to me: frying and baking (though I now see both these applications described on the Amazon site). The oven is small enough, yet deep enough, that it’s the perfect size to fry plantains, or fritters, both of which are family favorites. And — I bake sourdough bread. I like giving away sourdough boules. But I can only make 2 at a time using a 5qt Dutch oven. With this petite baby, I can separate my dough into 4 boules and bake them in the oven. The Blue Parmedu has found its purpose in our home.A final thought, the blue enamel of this Dutch oven is absolutely eye-catching — the way the blue fades from light to dark and vice versa.

Enameled Dutch Oven', 'author': 'JFR', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I love the cooking benefits of cast iron, so an enameled cast iron Dutch Oven, for me, is a kitchen essential. I have a name brand, mid priced, 6-quart enameled Dutch oven that I’ve used for years, and it’s held up well with only slight crazing and discoloration to its light-colored interior. It’s been excellent for larger meals but have wanted a smaller size for diversity. I’ve used the Parmedu Dutch oven twice now to test it out. Once on the stovetop and once in the oven. One thing I noticed right away is how well the lid fits on the pot. It overhangs slightly from the edge of the pot making for a nice seal. Cooking with it, I found that it conducts heat very well and its lid, with rounded spikes on the underside, causes condensation to drip off the lid evenly into the pot. That evenly dispersed condensation made for an exceptionally moist small pork roast because it served to baste the meat while cooking in the oven. The roast was fork tender and evenly cooked. On the stovetop, I used the Dutch oven to cook a small pot of beans that simmered for several hours. I used three kinds of beans and all cooked evenly. The Dutch oven cleans up easily and so far, shows no sign of discoloration or crazing. Although light-colored enameled interiors do tend to discolor some over time and show eventual crazing, I prefer it to a dark interior. I like to clearly see what I’m cooking, and a light interior helps. The Parmedu Dutch oven has a nice smooth finish and does seem durable to me, at least as durable as my 6-quart, so believe it will last.

After appropriate seasoning and burn it, I used both for a trial run ""short cut"" chicken pot pie, to see how useful this will be for two person meals.I knew the cooking would go fast once the pie was assembled and in the oven so I diced and parboiled 3 small Yukon (chosen for their buttery creaminess) potatoes. While they cooked, i prepped and sauteed some onion, celery and carrots.When the aromatics were softened, I scraped them into a bowl and added a drained large can of chicken, drained potatoes, and frozen peas.Use the same pot, I made approximately 1.5-2 cups, of the white sauce (beurre blanc), seasoned with what came to hand, and cooked until it was as thick as I wanted. I mixed this with the ingredients in the bowl, wiped out the dutch oven, then poured the mixture back into it.I put the pot into the oven and heated it to 400 F. ""biscuit baking"" temperature, while separated small canned biscuits into two layers. FYI It took the took 10 halves or 5 biscuits to cover the surface and there were approximated 4 healthy servings in the filled pot.I was out of a few essential things that I had envisioned as contributors to the taste i was aiming for, like sage and fresh milk, so I substituted with what i had on hand. The test audience (Italian American) says that though this is a different flavor profile for him, it may be good enough to have leftovers for lunch tomorrow. We\'ll see how the flavor holds up overnight.But I am very happy with the size and functionality of this pot. Next up Coq Au Vin! Ham and scalloped potatoes!

So...boxed up my beautiful present and sent it back tearfully. More careful review...I was not crazy about the color choices on this but it seemed great...and light! I ordered it with trepidation...it came...it is so wonderful. I LOVE it...could not be easier to cook in and clean after. Some folks did not like the way the lid fit and I worried it would slip off...no problem...plenty of ""connection"" to the pot...handles do get warm but that is something I am used to. I adore this pot...the ""red"" is more an old fashioned look...more of a burnt brickish color to me...looks terrific. I am so happy to have the perfect pot in my later years...maybe my cooking will improve! The 5 quart size is just right too...holds lots of soup, stew, etc. My Hubby likes to bake bread and is eagerly planning to try that in it too!

Once the bacon cooked down, I was able to move the food around with ease.After the bacon was fully cooked and the skillet was still hot (please use oven mitts), I took tongs and a paper towel and rubbed the bacon fat all over the inside of the skillet and the lid. You can also use vegetable oil to wipe down the skillet – I chose to use bacon because…well, it’s bacon.I placed the skillet and lid upside down on the oven rack and set the timer for one hour. Be advised: the oven does get smoky so don’t be alarmed.Once the hour was up, I turned off the oven and let the pan cooled a bit before removing the skillet.Cleaning the skillet:It is easier to clean the skillet when it is still a bit warm, but please use cautionUsing Morton’s sea salt and a paper towel I began to scrub the skillet (you can also use a raw potato and sea salt)Once clean I rinsed out the skillet and immediately put it on low heat for about 2 minutes to evaporate any waterStore in a cool, dry place to prevent rustingA couple of notes:NEVER submerge a cast iron skillet in water as it will cause rust)NEVER use soapNEVER put a cast iron skillet in the dishwasherIf you do have rust – use steel wool to scour and remove the rust.

I do like that Lodge is made in the U.S., but I wish they were more competitively priced. A 12 quart lodge dutch oven was double the cost of this one. And as I said, I like the legs on the Camp Chef lid.I was afraid that 12 quarts might be too big, but the lid actually accounts for about 3 of those quarts, so the pot is only about 9 quarts which is a perfect size for me. It was pre-seasoned and the first thing I made was a cobbler. Clean up was easy. After cleaning I heated it on my grill to dry it and then rubbed some more oil all over it. A few days later I wanted to test how well the lid worked as a griddle. The legs on the lid let me sit it right on the coals and I made some bacon and eggs. I cooked the bacon first and the lid held a whole pound of it. After that I drained the bacon grease and fried a half dozen eggs and there was no trouble with sticking. Again, clean up was a breeze.

The pot is well built, pre-seasoned and ready to go right out of the box. It was also an excellent price compared to other brands I looked at.

So far I\'ve used it serveral times, and have cooked a variety of meals in it. Its performance thus far has been great. It holds heat very well, and is solidly constructed. I was a little disappointed to see that it was manufactured in China, but I should have researched before. With that said, it performs on par with it\'s ""Lodge"" counterparts as I also own a Lodge 8qt. and a 6qt. dutch oven. Plus you\'ll save between 20-40 dollars with this purchase over the Lodge products. This dutch oven is slightly thinner than it\'s Lodge counterparts though, but I\'m not sure if it\'s a quality issue, or if all 12qt.\'s and higher have slightly thinner walls. The slightly thinner wall doesn\'t seem to be an issue though, as again, it does hold heat in very well. It comes \'pre-seasoned\' but as I do with all my new or used cast iron, I go ahead and give it a good scrub down with an abrasive brillo pad and a little Dawn liquid soap and re-cure it myself. I know there are some who will scoff, or react in horror at doing this, but I\'ve cooked with cast iron for well over 20 yrs and as long as you give it a good scrub, and then rinse it clean, then promply dry it with a towel then add another light coat of veggie shortening or oil, you will have no problems with pitting or rust. The top of this dutch oven has a nice retainer lip for hot coals to be placed on top for even heat distribution and has a good sturdy lifting ring that\'s well balanced. It can even be turned upside down to make a nice cooking griddle for pancakes or eggs and even has its own support pegs for this purpose My box also came with a new lifting tool, so there\'s no need to purchase one if you don\'t already have one. It\'s plenty big enough to cook a full sized chicken and all the sides. You could probably even cook a young turkey in it too, if you split it in half, and lay the halves down flat. I hauled this in for a little over 50 bucks and so far it has been worth every penny. In fact, if I was only going to own one dutch oven, this would be the one.

I love the legs molded into the lid, and the depth of the lid. (very handy) It dwarfs my 12 inch Lodge dutch oven. The design in the lid is a nice perk, but if anything, it probably makes the lid weaker. I still like it though.I don\'t have a caliber handy, but going by feel, I believe the Lodge is slightly thicker. I also noticed the Camp Chef does not seem to be an even thickness all the way around. Defiantly a quality issue. It may be my imagination, but the cast iron doesn\'t feel as solid as the Lodge dutch oven. All things being equal I would go with the Lodge which is American made, but they aren\'t equal. The Lodge is considerably more expensive so I am happy with my purchase. If the Camp Chef cracks on me, or food burns easily, I\'ll change my tune in a hurry, but I don\'t think it will, and the design with legs built into the lid, is so much better than the basic Lodge design. I like the Grand Canyon casting in the lid even though it is simple, it adds charm to the pot. I now have a 10"", two 12"" and the new Camp Chef which is 14"". At this point I would give it two thumbs up, but only 4 stars because it does feel a little thinner, and being a bigger pot it should be slightly thicker than the 12"".

I browned the chicken before adding it to the Dutch Oven and then I slow cooked it all together in the pot. It was delicious and I ate that for like a week.

Also, the lids have only a small rim and any accumulated moisture will pour onto your stove top if you are not careful.These are very good pots, reasonably light, (compared to my Le Cruset pots), and relatively non-stick.

The lid fits well, and its glass-so you can keep an eye on what you are cooking, the bottom hearts evenly and quickly, and if you follow the 'hot pan, cold oil' rule, you should have a nice surface that doesn't stick AND cleans up well.While I have ALWAYS used and loved the natural non-stick qualities of the large cast iron fry pans used to cook family meals, I wanted something that could go thru the dishwasher, wasn't hard on my wrists, and was big enough to cook a whole casserole. This pan TOTALLY fits the bill.I also love that it can go from stove top to oven, and that the handles aren't long, wieldy and clumsy.

The handles are hefty and sturdy, the bottom is weighted and balanced nicely to sit very still while lightly stirring with one hand on a glass top or induction surface. This pan heats evenly and quickly and holds temperature surprisingly well when large cuts of cold meat or food enter the pan.This makes short work of sauteeing, simmering, braising, and just about anything other regular household cooking duties you can throw at it. Being dishwasher safe makes it even better, once the visible food particles have been sprayed or cleaned off this thing can just be popped right in the dishwasher to save tedious scrubbing that nobody wants to do after a meal. Comes out of a regular dishwasher cycle looking brand new.The only downside, and this isn't even really a huge deal but is just worth mentioning in case someone has delicate or sensitive skin on their hands, is the fact that the very outer lip edge of the pan appears to be slightly squared/angled instead of polished or ground to a smooth edge. The very edge of the lip is noticeably sharp to the touch, not enough to actually cut skin but it is uncomfortable to run your bare hand or finger over the lip of the pan while cleaning. Good thing the handles on this are top notch and minimize the amount of times you will ever realistically need to touch the edge of the pan itself. Minor detail, but it feels a little unfinished on the edge compared with how smooth and nice the texture of the handles, exterior, and interior of the actual pan are.Overall for the price point this is a no-brainer to pick up for a great all-purpose pan.

You will use this to lower in and lift out the loaf after baking.-To extract the loaf after baking, I usually have to lift one side of the loaf out first and the use a wooden spatula under the bottom to gently pry it out. A second person can be helpful.-I preheat it in a 450 oven for an hour and bake at 450 also.

There was a small amount of what appeared to be sticker residue of some sort on the lip of the pot, but that came off with no effort when I washed it.The difference in colour between the top and bottom is quite noticeable. The top is a lovely glazed blue, the bottom is matt, with a more indigo colour to it. If you're slightly OCD, this colour difference will drive you bananas.Upon receipt of the box, I immediately unpacked the pot, washed it, and promptly baked a loaf of bread. It turned out pretty well! I'm a very beginning baker, and by the looks of my boule it could use another few minutes in the oven, but overall it worked exactly as I hoped it would.The 3qt pot is perfect for a small loaf.Mindful of the reviews saying the lid did not fit, and the sides were slightly tapered, I paid attention to those things. The lid fits perfectly. The sides are indeed very very slightly tapered - but you'd only notice if you were looking very closely. I used parchment paper when baking the bread, and it lifted out of the pot with no problems at all. It may be an issue if you use a much larger amount of dough? I think it would take at least twice or three times the amount before removal became an issue.Overall I am very pleased indeed with this pretty little pot. If anything goes wrong in subsequent months I will update my review, so if you see no update you can assume all is well."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 21, 2022', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Cooks excellent sourdough bread', 'author': 'Harland Butler', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Everything is great', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 15, 2024', 'is_verified': True}]"

A LOT & our stuff gets used. this handy little bugger though fits the bill when a behemoth cast iron piece just isn\'t necessary. it\'s versatile, lighter than other pieces due to size, extremely durable/ well made & very likely could wind up one of those \'heirloom\' pieces that gets passed down from generation to generation. does this justify the price tag? i don\'t know, you be the judge. however, if you buy it, just know you\'re making a legitimate investment that will pay for itself over and over and over again for decades to come. yes, i would recommend this piece - 100%.

Sollner', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""Having tried three different pans before choosing this Zwilling JA Henckels Spirit Thermolon, this is just a purchase expanding on that choice. Here's a copy of the review I posted on the three test pans:........... Earlier review ..........I have had these pans for a couple of months now, so it's time to jot down my initial impressions. The three brands and the pans I have areCuisinart GGT19-18 GreenGourmet Tri-Ply Stainless 2-Quart SaucepanZwilling J.A. Henckels 3-qt. Thermolon Ceramic Nonstick Spirit Saute Pan, 6-qt. Dutch Oven, andDuxtop Whole-Clad Tri-Ply Stainless Steel 3-Quart Saucepan and 10-Inch Fry PanAll these pans are made from 3-layer sandwiches of magnetic stainless steel on the outside to absorb heat from any stove, including induction, an aluminum layer to distribute the heat over the bottom since stainless steel is a poor heat conductor, and another layer of stainless steel on the inside. All have riveted handles, which is probably inevitable with pots made from a tri-layer sandwich. All have a lifetime warranty. The nonstick pans have an additional layer to prevent sticking. I made a very rough estimate of the thickness of the aluminum layer, which is critical for heat distribution. Judging by how the edges are polished by the manufacturer, the three layers can, in places, be discerned and their thicknesses estimated. Here are my estimates:Duxtop: Total thickness: 2.7 mm (total thickness is the most accurate of the estimates). Outside SS: 0.7 mm, inside SS 0.3 mm, therefore the aluminum layer is about 1.7 mm.Zwilling-Henckels: Total thickness: 3.6 mm); Outside SS: 0.5 mm, inside SS 0.5 mm, therefore the aluminum layer is about 2.6 mm.Cuisinart: Total thickness: 2.7 mm; Outside SS: 0.8 mm; inside SS 0.6 mm, therefore the aluminum layer is about 1.3 mm.The Duxtop pans are by far the most beautiful, with a high polish to the stainless steel inside and out. The handles are heavy cast alloy, also highly polished, and the most comfortable handles in this group. The Duxtop, unlike the Cuisinart and Zwilling pans, do not have nonstick coating. They are ideal for cooking or heating soups and other liquids, and they do a fine job on eggs as long as there is sufficient butter in the pan. However, when it comes to foods that tend to stick, like oatmeal, the nonstick surfaces win out. Also on the negative side, the bottom of the 10-inch frying pan is sufficiently thin that on an induction heater that is only 4.5-inches in diameter, as many are, the edges of the pan are sufficiently cooler than the center that omelets are best done on gas. The highly polished interior does discolor when cooking some foods; however a light application of Bar Keepers Friend brings back the original luster. Not available with nonstick surface, and single piece selection is limited. An 8-piece set is quite reasonable priced.The Zwilling J.A. Henckels pans are somewhat more expensive than the other two and seem of the highest quality. The nonstick is free of both PTFE and PFOA, for those concerned with such things. The claim is that this coating is stable up to 850 F. The handles are perhaps the least comfortable of the three [not an issue with the dutch oven], but OK and not unattractive. The outside finish, while not having the high polish of the Duxtop, is businesslike. In general use, these also seem to spread the heat better than either Duxtop or Cuisinart, which is not surprising given their noticeably thicker aluminum layer. The see-through lids, which neither Duxtop nor Cuisinart have, are nice, though like the others the lid handles do get warm enough eventually that a pot-holder is advised. Of the three brands, this is my favorite.The Cuisinart pans have an outside polish similar to the Zwilling-Henckels with more-comfortable handles, but for their lower price they have thinner tri-ply and solid lids. The nonstick surface is claimed to be PTFE and PFOA free and good to 550 F in the oven. As I only have the 2-qt. pan, there's not much to say, but nothing to complain about. It has been fully nonstick for me, even for challenges like oatmeal, though some others with frying pans have complained about sticking. The bottom seems to spread the heat of a 4.5-inch induction heater better than the Duxtop does, in spite of the thinner estimated aluminum layer. That could be because the lower conductivity of the nonstick allows the aluminum to do its job before the heat makes it through the nonstick. There are reasonably priced sets available that should fill most kitchen needs, and several single pieces are available."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States April 13, 2013', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Best Nonstick Dutch Oven', 'author': 'Tough Critic', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I needed to replace an old GreenPan nonstick Dutch Oven that had a nonstick coating that was no longer non-stick.

When simmering food on my gas cooktop you can see how perfectly even it cooks all the way across the bottom of the pan. The ceramic Thermolon nonstick coating works great and the food slides out of the pan without any effort. I will be using this dutch oven several times a week because the cleanup is so fast and easy.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States November 14, 2019', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': ""5.0 out of 5 stars Best pot I've ever bought"", 'author': 'Anthony S', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""The quality is superior to any pot I've ever bought and I have very good pots.

I have tried to use all other pots, and trust me, nothing is the same. It has become my perfect heavy soup pot. Usually I cook it to boil, and turned off the stove. Let it sit and continue cooking itself. For most part that's all it takes unless it's something like big chunky bones.I just follow the instructions to use: never turn up the stove higher than medium and always has liquid in the pot. To clean it I just put water inside and boil, wipe it clean while the pot is warm with sponges. Until one day I forgot it on the stove and the bottom of the pot was completely burnt. I saw small crack lines on the bottom and even though surface was still sealed fine.

It arrived in perfect condition and was very well and securely packed.I prepared a delicious rosemary, vegetable & pork roast dinner this evening and it performed beautifully. Browning the meat was easy with no sticking, and a gorgeous fond developed that quickly dissolved when cooking the vegetables.The lid fit securely and generated a good tight seal. The metallic lid knob is very strong and thick and much better than cheap plastic knobs found on most Dutch ovens.The side handles are very strong and thick for easy lifting.The dimples on the inside of the lid are an excellent idea, and help disperse condensing steam over the food during cooking that bastes the food.Cleanup was a breeze with just a little soapy water and very gentle scrubbing with a sponge.The red outer color is gorgeous and the beige interior is excellent for seeing the fond coloring.Helpful Hints:1) NEVER use metal utensils with an enabled Dutch oven. Always use a wooden or silicon spoon and NEVER use metal whisks or tongs. Invest in a good pair of silicone-coated tongs or the enamel will get scratched over time when sautéing meat.2) NEVER put an enameled Dutch Oven above 230C (450F) or the enamel will be ruined over time.3) Be careful not to scratch the bottom of the Dutch oven when placing on metal stove or oven rack. Scratches will eventually cause the enamel to flake off.4) invest in a good pair of silicon oven gloves for maximum heat protection and maintaining a good grip on the heavy Dutch oven.You can’t go wrong with this purchase in terms of: price, quality, design and attractiveness.

I've made dishes like Puerto Rican Arroz con Pollo and Red Beans and Rice in it for my family and it did a decent job. You just have to understand what it's like to cook in aluminum versus something like cast iron. You can sear in it or do a low and slow braise, but absolutely do put it over super high direct heat or have it over a roaring fire or you'll burn whatever you put in it. I'm pretty sure the nonstick coating shouldn't be subjected to that kind of heat either. They don't specify the nonstick coating materials, but it's not ceramic from what I see and the old school Teflon stuff hasn't been around for some time, but it will ruin the coating if you park it over a big flame or heat it over a cranked up burner with say, nothing in it. Mind the size though.

There are absolutely no problems with this unit, unless you count a little oil discoloration on the aluminum handle, and I don't. If you've never owned cast-iron, yes, you can wash it in hot soapy water to get the dirt and debris off, but dishwashers are a big NO. Not EVER. Then, you must take a paper towel and some cooking oil and wipe a thin layer of cooking oil all over the cast iron, inside and out, and put it in a corner of the oven. Heat the oven to 350 degrees, (you can bake something if you want) then turn it off, leaving the pot inside as it cools. Wipe off any excess oil that remains with a paper towel.

First use was for tetrazzini - cooked evenly, cleaned fairly easily by boiling vinegar and water in it and letting it soak until the water cooled, and still looks new.Now the general stuff: Enameled cast iron is not nonstick in the way that thermalon is or the way that teflon is. But as long as it isn't enameled with lead (which is why I usually buy expensive stuff), it is more nonstick than bare stainless steel. It's about the same as well-seasoned cast iron. Unless it's the rough gray enamel, in which case, it's not nonstick at all.This is a surprisingly inexpensive name brand lasagna pan. It's the white smooth enamel. It's not going to release everything or clean up with a quick sponge wipe. Best practice is to soak and wipe. Don't use harsh cleansers or scrubbers. Other best practice is try not to burn the &*&* out of it.It will cook evenly and efficiently. It won't warp for anything. It may chip -> even the more expensive pans will.

Rarely have I ever found such an immensely practical tool for a reasonable investment. Can probably be passed down to your children along with your cast iron Dutch ovens.P.S. Before you lift your lid, give some thought to where you'll set it down while going back to stir your food or whatever. You need to keep it fairly level, so that ashes and coals don't spill, and you'll need a pretty clean surface, because the underside of the lid is going to go back on top of your food when you return the lid to your oven. Or else you need to be able to hold the lid lifter and lid level and straight in one hand while stirring with the other!P.P.S. Important: if you're hanging the oven by the bail/handle over the fire, you'll need to take the oven off the fire first and set it down so that you can let the bail fall to the side.

F.', 'rating': 4, 'content': ""I have three lifters to compare. They are the traditional styled Lodge A5 Camp Dutch Oven Lid Lifter, this Lodge A5DLL Deluxe Lid Lifter, and the Camp Chef Professional Dutch Oven Lid Lifter (Black, 9-Inch). Here is my unbiased opinion of all three.Lodge A5 Camp Dutch Oven Lid LifterPros:This is a multi-purpose item and it surprisingly has the best finish & has the least sloppily welded junctions of all three lifters.I say this is a multi-purpose item because the two deluxe lifters are pretty much dedicated dutch oven table / charcoal cooking items. If you are cooking over a campfire I would go with the A5 because it can be used as a fire poker, and a coal rake as well as a lid lifter.The A5 lifter is just as good as the Camp Chef when it comes to carrying a dutch oven by the bail handle over long distances because of the T-handle portion that is welded to the handle. The Deluxe Lodge A5DLL lifter is slightly worse because of the odd downward slope of the handle.Cons:The A5 does not have a cushioned handle like the other two.There is more of a learning curve as far as balancing the lid is concerned.... But not as drastic as other reviewers would lead you to believe unless you are truly an uncoordinated klutz. Yes, the deluxe lifters are both more stable when it comes to controlling the lid, but as of right now, the only major thing I can do with the other lifters that I cannot do with the traditional A5 is grab the lid and turn it completely upside down. Unless you are a tricked out dutch oven stunt cooking artist, then there is really no need to do this. I'm still able to use the A5 to tilt the lid to either side to knock the ashes off and whatever else I need to do while cooking and transporting (by the bail handle) the ovens. The point, I am trying to make is that the A5 is not as bad as people try to make it out to be.Lodge A5DLL Deluxe Lid LifterPros:This one has the best length for ground cooking. That is about the only good advantage that this one has over the rest of them, however, if you plan on doing deep bean hole type cooking, then I would go with the Camp Chef Professional Dutch Oven Lid Lifter, 22-Inch (which I do not own, but looks identical to the 9-inch which I do own).Cons:The finish on this model is the worst of the three. It is almost as if they baked on the finish and then tried to weld it together after the fact... as opposed to the Camp Chef which looks like it was welded first... then baked on the finished (which is how I would expect the process to be done). Then inner bar of the A5DLL Deluxe wiggles and turns inside the outer sleeve much more so than the Camp Chef, which is very annoying.I am not sure I am all that sold on the downward slope of the A5DLL handle as opposed to the straight, parallel handle configuration of the Camp Chef.To me, this is the worst lifter... and it cost the most. Looks like I paid more for the Lodge name, rather than any added or superior benefits over the Camp Chef version. However it's not really something that I would waste time trying to return through the mail because the advantages of the Camp Chef version over this one are minimal. If I had to do it all over again, knowing what I know now, I would probably have purchased the 14-inch Camp Chef version over the A5DLL, but then I would be giving up 2 inches in length which is better for ground cooking as opposed to table cooking.Camp Chef Professional Dutch oven Lid Lifter (Black, 9-Inch)Pros:This one is the best for dutch oven table cooking because of its length. It keeps you from having the move the ovens around on the table in an awkward position because the length is just right.The handle on the Camp Chef has more of a solid feel than the Lodge Deluxe A5DLL version. The parallel bar configuration works the best for me.The weld junctions on the Camp Chef are better and it has a slightly more beefier construction than the Lodge Deluxe A5DLL. However, the lodge A5 has the best welds (read: more durability) of all three lifters that I own.Cons:The only con I can see at this point is that the metal is exposed under the outer sleeve of the t-handle (I assume to make it slide better inside the sleeve) on the Camp Chef. There could be a rusting issue somewhere down the line... then again maybe not because it looks like that part is galvanized. Only time will tell. There really is no need for this portion to be unfinished, because part of the bar that slides within the tube is finished and it does not hinder the way the bar functions at all.Final thoughts:Overall I like the traditional A5 the best but that is just my personal preference because of its multi-functional versatility. It's just a jack of all trades. I can do almost everything the deluxe lifters can do, plus I can use it as a fire poker and a coal raker.If you are cooking over a campfire, go with the A-5. If your cooking is limited only to cooking on a dutch oven table, then I would go with the 9-inch Camp Chef lifter. If you are ground or bean-hole cooking then I would take a long look at both the Camp Chef 14-inch and 22-inch lid lifters before deciding to buy the Lodge A5DLL Deluxe Lid Lifter."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 28, 2013', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great useful tool for safety; excellent condition; great packaging', 'author': 'Take And Read', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'The Lodge Camp Dutch Oven Lifter came in excellent condition.

If you've never owned cast-iron, yes, you can wash it in hot soapy water to get the dirt and debris off, but dishwashers are a big NO. Not EVER. Then, you must take a paper towel and some cooking oil and wipe a thin layer of cooking oil all over the cast iron, inside and out, and put it in a corner of the oven. Heat the oven to 350 degrees, (you can bake something if you want) then turn it off, leaving the pot inside as it cools. Wipe off any excess oil that remains with a paper towel.

I've made dishes like Puerto Rican Arroz con Pollo and Red Beans and Rice in it for my family and it did a decent job. You just have to understand what it's like to cook in aluminum versus something like cast iron. You can sear in it or do a low and slow braise, but absolutely do put it over super high direct heat or have it over a roaring fire or you'll burn whatever you put in it. I'm pretty sure the nonstick coating shouldn't be subjected to that kind of heat either. They don't specify the nonstick coating materials, but it's not ceramic from what I see and the old school Teflon stuff hasn't been around for some time, but it will ruin the coating if you park it over a big flame or heat it over a cranked up burner with say, nothing in it. Mind the size though. The specific one I got to try is the biggest one they offer and it's almost so big it's not as suitable for home cooking as some of the smaller ones, but with that bigger size comes bigger capacity and capability of cooking bigger and more things.

First use was for tetrazzini - cooked evenly, cleaned fairly easily by boiling vinegar and water in it and letting it soak until the water cooled, and still looks new.Now the general stuff: Enameled cast iron is not nonstick in the way that thermalon is or the way that teflon is. But as long as it isn't enameled with lead (which is why I usually buy expensive stuff), it is more nonstick than bare stainless steel. It's about the same as well-seasoned cast iron. Unless it's the rough gray enamel, in which case, it's not nonstick at all.This is a surprisingly inexpensive name brand lasagna pan. It's the white smooth enamel. It's not going to release everything or clean up with a quick sponge wipe. Best practice is to soak and wipe. Don't use harsh cleansers or scrubbers. Other best practice is try not to burn the &*&* out of it.It will cook evenly and efficiently. It won't warp for anything. It may chip -> even the more expensive pans will.

Now, maybe you're a great cook, or at least like to cook. Not me; in fact, I wish I could microwave everything. But I found with a little patience, baking in the oven was far better for some types of food. So out would come the (very fake) 5-quart Le Creuset until one day, I forgot which came first - heat the oven and then put the pot in or let the pot heat up with the oven (and let's not mention that I have a pizza stone in there). Sure enough, I hear a 'pow' as the pot cracks in half. Thank goodness, I wasn't cooking anything liquid. Eventually, I broke down and went shopping to replace the pot. At Home Goods of course, where I had purchased the first one for less than fifty bucks. They had nothing. Hmm, I researched the brand and manufacturer (generic, Chinese). I start looking through anything that Amazon had (I didn't know what the thing was called so I started with 'stoneware' - don't ask why). 3 days later, and ready for bed, I see around $300 for the real Le Creuset, anywhere from $100-$200 for other brands, and - hey, wait, around $50 for an Amazon Basics? Hmm, maybe I should, but I am always afraid of something that is so much cheaper. Cast iron, cast iron, it has to be non-stick cast iron (I have no idea if that's right, all I knew about the previous pot was, well, nothing - it cracked in half and didn't look like cast iron inside). I am about to give up when I see Granitestone. Oh, what a scam. But I start to read the reviews and I read more and research more and heck, $60 for a 5-quart aluminum pot. It can't be any good, but after three days I was punch drunk for scanning cookware (I haven't touched alcohol for over a dozen years but I remember the feeling!). I'm very frugal (OK, cheap) and was sure I was wasting good money but I ordered it (6 very different colors to choose from but I thought the blue looked attractive). It arrived. It sat for a week, while I pondered simply returning it. So light, was there even anything in the box? It gets unpacked - and sits outside the box for another week. By now, you're thinking, is he ever going to tell us if he liked the pot? Well, yes, I did like the pot. I love the pot! (Eh, let's not get carried away, I still don't like to cook.) It is incredibly lightweight but beautifully crafted. I have now made almost a dozen different things in it. About a quarter of them, I burnt to a crisp. Not the pot's fault. It turns out that 45 minutes in a 350 degree oven will burn some things to a crisp. But shockingly enough, not reduced to dust or, worse, to be glued to the pot and destroying the non-stick surface. If you like toasted, crispy food, you're in luck - dinner is saved. For you; don't serve your guests burnt food. But the foods were edible and the pot cleaned with one swipe of a sponge or even a paper towel. Everything about the experience has been positive, right down to the packaging and the advertising copy. I trusted the many positive reviews here on Amazon and I was not disappointed. I think you will feel the same way. I must add that this is the longest of the (very few) reviews I have submitted to Amazon. I'm a retired minister, with little or no expertise in cooking.

Before you lift your lid, give some thought to where you'll set it down while going back to stir your food or whatever. You need to keep it fairly level, so that ashes and coals don't spill, and you'll need a pretty clean surface, because the underside of the lid is going to go back on top of your food when you return the lid to your oven.

F.', 'rating': 4, 'content': ""I have three lifters to compare. They are the traditional styled Lodge A5 Camp Dutch Oven Lid Lifter, this Lodge A5DLL Deluxe Lid Lifter, and the Camp Chef Professional Dutch Oven Lid Lifter (Black, 9-Inch). Here is my unbiased opinion of all three.Lodge A5 Camp Dutch Oven Lid LifterPros:This is a multi-purpose item and it surprisingly has the best finish & has the least sloppily welded junctions of all three lifters.I say this is a multi-purpose item because the two deluxe lifters are pretty much dedicated dutch oven table / charcoal cooking items. If you are cooking over a campfire I would go with the A5 because it can be used as a fire poker, and a coal rake as well as a lid lifter.The A5 lifter is just as good as the Camp Chef when it comes to carrying a dutch oven by the bail handle over long distances because of the T-handle portion that is welded to the handle. The Deluxe Lodge A5DLL lifter is slightly worse because of the odd downward slope of the handle.Cons:The A5 does not have a cushioned handle like the other two.There is more of a learning curve as far as balancing the lid is concerned.... But not as drastic as other reviewers would lead you to believe unless you are truly an uncoordinated klutz. Yes, the deluxe lifters are both more stable when it comes to controlling the lid, but as of right now, the only major thing I can do with the other lifters that I cannot do with the traditional A5 is grab the lid and turn it completely upside down. Unless you are a tricked out dutch oven stunt cooking artist, then there is really no need to do this. I'm still able to use the A5 to tilt the lid to either side to knock the ashes off and whatever else I need to do while cooking and transporting (by the bail handle) the ovens. The point, I am trying to make is that the A5 is not as bad as people try to make it out to be.Lodge A5DLL Deluxe Lid LifterPros:This one has the best length for ground cooking. That is about the only good advantage that this one has over the rest of them, however, if you plan on doing deep bean hole type cooking, then I would go with the Camp Chef Professional Dutch Oven Lid Lifter, 22-Inch (which I do not own, but looks identical to the 9-inch which I do own).Cons:The finish on this model is the worst of the three. It is almost as if they baked on the finish and then tried to weld it together after the fact... as opposed to the Camp Chef which looks like it was welded first... then baked on the finished (which is how I would expect the process to be done). Then inner bar of the A5DLL Deluxe wiggles and turns inside the outer sleeve much more so than the Camp Chef, which is very annoying.I am not sure I am all that sold on the downward slope of the A5DLL handle as opposed to the straight, parallel handle configuration of the Camp Chef.To me, this is the worst lifter... and it cost the most. Looks like I paid more for the Lodge name, rather than any added or superior benefits over the Camp Chef version. However it's not really something that I would waste time trying to return through the mail because the advantages of the Camp Chef version over this one are minimal. If I had to do it all over again, knowing what I know now, I would probably have purchased the 14-inch Camp Chef version over the A5DLL, but then I would be giving up 2 inches in length which is better for ground cooking as opposed to table cooking.Camp Chef Professional Dutch oven Lid Lifter (Black, 9-Inch)Pros:This one is the best for dutch oven table cooking because of its length. It keeps you from having the move the ovens around on the table in an awkward position because the length is just right.The handle on the Camp Chef has more of a solid feel than the Lodge Deluxe A5DLL version. The parallel bar configuration works the best for me.The weld junctions on the Camp Chef are better and it has a slightly more beefier construction than the Lodge Deluxe A5DLL. However, the lodge A5 has the best welds (read: more durability) of all three lifters that I own.Cons:The only con I can see at this point is that the metal is exposed under the outer sleeve of the t-handle (I assume to make it slide better inside the sleeve) on the Camp Chef. There could be a rusting issue somewhere down the line... then again maybe not because it looks like that part is galvanized. Only time will tell. There really is no need for this portion to be unfinished, because part of the bar that slides within the tube is finished and it does not hinder the way the bar functions at all.Final thoughts:Overall I like the traditional A5 the best but that is just my personal preference because of its multi-functional versatility.

F.', 'rating': 3, 'content': ""I have three lifters to compare. They are the traditional styled Lodge A5 Camp Dutch Oven Lid Lifter, this Lodge A5DLL Deluxe Lid Lifter, and the Camp Chef Professional Dutch Oven Lid Lifter (Black, 9-Inch). Here is my unbiased opinion of all three.Lodge A5 Camp Dutch Oven Lid LifterPros:This is a multi-purpose item and it surprisingly has the best finish & has the least sloppily welded junctions of all three lifters.I say this is a multi-purpose item because the two deluxe lifters are pretty much dedicated dutch oven table / charcoal cooking items. If you are cooking over a campfire I would go with the A5 because it can be used as a fire poker, and a coal rake as well as a lid lifter.The A5 lifter is just as good as the Camp Chef when it comes to carrying a dutch oven by the bail handle over long distances because of the T-handle portion that is welded to the handle. The Deluxe Lodge A5DLL lifter is slightly worse because of the odd downward slope of the handle.Cons:The A5 does not have a cushioned handle like the other two.There is more of a learning curve as far as balancing the lid is concerned.... But not as drastic as other reviewers would lead you to believe unless you are truly an uncoordinated klutz. Yes, the deluxe lifters are both more stable when it comes to controlling the lid, but as of right now, the only major thing I can do with the other lifters that I cannot do with the traditional A5 is grab the lid and turn it completely upside down. Unless you are a tricked out dutch oven stunt cooking artist, then there is really no need to do this. I'm still able to use the A5 to tilt the lid to either side to knock the ashes off and whatever else I need to do while cooking and transporting (by the bail handle) the ovens. The point, I am trying to make is that the A5 is not as bad as people try to make it out to be.Lodge A5DLL Deluxe Lid LifterPros:This one has the best length for ground cooking. That is about the only good advantage that this one has over the rest of them, however, if you plan on doing deep bean hole type cooking, then I would go with the Camp Chef Professional Dutch Oven Lid Lifter, 22-Inch (which I do not own, but looks identical to the 9-inch which I do own).Cons:The finish on this model is the worst of the three. It is almost as if they baked on the finish and then tried to weld it together after the fact... as opposed to the Camp Chef which looks like it was welded first... then baked on the finished (which is how I would expect the process to be done). Then inner bar of the A5DLL Deluxe wiggles and turns inside the outer sleeve much more so than the Camp Chef, which is very annoying.I am not sure I am all that sold on the downward slope of the A5DLL handle as opposed to the straight, parallel handle configuration of the Camp Chef.To me, this is the worst lifter... and it cost the most. Looks like I paid more for the Lodge name, rather than any added or superior benefits over the Camp Chef version. However it's not really something that I would waste time trying to return through the mail because the advantages of the Camp Chef version over this one are minimal. If I had to do it all over again, knowing what I know now, I would probably have purchased the 14-inch Camp Chef version over the A5DLL, but then I would be giving up 2 inches in length which is better for ground cooking as opposed to table cooking.Camp Chef Professional Dutch oven Lid Lifter (Black, 9-Inch)Pros:This one is the best for dutch oven table cooking because of its length. It keeps you from having the move the ovens around on the table in an awkward position because the length is just right.The handle on the Camp Chef has more of a solid feel than the Lodge Deluxe A5DLL version. The parallel bar configuration works the best for me.The weld junctions on the Camp Chef are better and it has a slightly more beefier construction than the Lodge Deluxe A5DLL. However, the lodge A5 has the best welds (read: more durability) of all three lifters that I own.Cons:The only con I can see at this point is that the metal is exposed under the outer sleeve of the t-handle (I assume to make it slide better inside the sleeve) on the Camp Chef. There could be a rusting issue somewhere down the line... then again maybe not because it looks like that part is galvanized. Only time will tell. There really is no need for this portion to be unfinished, because part of the bar that slides within the tube is finished and it does not hinder the way the bar functions at all.Final thoughts:Overall I like the traditional A5 the best but that is just my personal preference because of its multi-functional versatility. It's just a jack of all trades. I can do almost everything the deluxe lifters can do, plus I can use it as a fire poker and a coal raker.If you are cooking over a campfire, go with the A-5. If your cooking is limited only to cooking on a dutch oven table, then I would go with the 9-inch Camp Chef lifter. If you are ground or bean-hole cooking then I would take a long look at both the Camp Chef 14-inch and 22-inch lid lifters before deciding to buy this Lodge A5DLL Deluxe Lid Lifter."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 28, 2013', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great', 'author': 'Deron L.', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Works as it should', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 15, 2023', 'is_verified': True}]"

The bright yellow handles on this deluxe lid lifter made it easy to locate in the flickering firelight, especially with it\'s long, leggy shape that free-stands on its own. At the end of the night the deluxe model held on firmly as I swung my dutch oven lid completely upside down to return the coals on top of it to the fire, obviously sparking jealousy from the older lid lifters who previously had so much fun dropping the lid on my toe when I attempted such a move.

F.', 'rating': 3, 'content': ""I have three lifters to compare. They are the traditional styled Lodge A5 Camp Dutch Oven Lid Lifter, this Lodge A5DLL Deluxe Lid Lifter, and the Camp Chef Professional Dutch Oven Lid Lifter (Black, 9-Inch). Here is my unbiased opinion of all three.Lodge A5 Camp Dutch Oven Lid LifterPros:This is a multi-purpose item and it surprisingly has the best finish & has the least sloppily welded junctions of all three lifters.I say this is a multi-purpose item because the two deluxe lifters are pretty much dedicated dutch oven table / charcoal cooking items. If you are cooking over a campfire I would go with the A5 because it can be used as a fire poker, and a coal rake as well as a lid lifter.The A5 lifter is just as good as the Camp Chef when it comes to carrying a dutch oven by the bail handle over long distances because of the T-handle portion that is welded to the handle. The Deluxe Lodge A5DLL lifter is slightly worse because of the odd downward slope of the handle.Cons:The A5 does not have a cushioned handle like the other two.There is more of a learning curve as far as balancing the lid is concerned.... But not as drastic as other reviewers would lead you to believe unless you are truly an uncoordinated klutz. Yes, the deluxe lifters are both more stable when it comes to controlling the lid, but as of right now, the only major thing I can do with the other lifters that I cannot do with the traditional A5 is grab the lid and turn it completely upside down. Unless you are a tricked out dutch oven stunt cooking artist, then there is really no need to do this. I'm still able to use the A5 to tilt the lid to either side to knock the ashes off and whatever else I need to do while cooking and transporting (by the bail handle) the ovens. The point, I am trying to make is that the A5 is not as bad as people try to make it out to be.Lodge A5DLL Deluxe Lid LifterPros:This one has the best length for ground cooking. That is about the only good advantage that this one has over the rest of them, however, if you plan on doing deep bean hole type cooking, then I would go with the Camp Chef Professional Dutch Oven Lid Lifter, 22-Inch (which I do not own, but looks identical to the 9-inch which I do own).Cons:The finish on this model is the worst of the three. It is almost as if they baked on the finish and then tried to weld it together after the fact... as opposed to the Camp Chef which looks like it was welded first... then baked on the finished (which is how I would expect the process to be done). Then inner bar of the A5DLL Deluxe wiggles and turns inside the outer sleeve much more so than the Camp Chef, which is very annoying.I am not sure I am all that sold on the downward slope of the A5DLL handle as opposed to the straight, parallel handle configuration of the Camp Chef.To me, this is the worst lifter... and it cost the most. Looks like I paid more for the Lodge name, rather than any added or superior benefits over the Camp Chef version. However it's not really something that I would waste time trying to return through the mail because the advantages of the Camp Chef version over this one are minimal. If I had to do it all over again, knowing what I know now, I would probably have purchased the 14-inch Camp Chef version over the A5DLL, but then I would be giving up 2 inches in length which is better for ground cooking as opposed to table cooking.Camp Chef Professional Dutch oven Lid Lifter (Black, 9-Inch)Pros:This one is the best for dutch oven table cooking because of its length. It keeps you from having the move the ovens around on the table in an awkward position because the length is just right.The handle on the Camp Chef has more of a solid feel than the Lodge Deluxe A5DLL version. The parallel bar configuration works the best for me.The weld junctions on the Camp Chef are better and it has a slightly more beefier construction than the Lodge Deluxe A5DLL. However, the lodge A5 has the best welds (read: more durability) of all three lifters that I own.Cons:The only con I can see at this point is that the metal is exposed under the outer sleeve of the t-handle (I assume to make it slide better inside the sleeve) on the Camp Chef. There could be a rusting issue somewhere down the line... then again maybe not because it looks like that part is galvanized. Only time will tell. There really is no need for this portion to be unfinished, because part of the bar that slides within the tube is finished and it does not hinder the way the bar functions at all.Final thoughts:Overall I like the traditional A5 the best but that is just my personal preference because of its multi-functional versatility. It's just a jack of all trades. I can do almost everything the deluxe lifters can do, plus I can use it as a fire poker and a coal raker.If you are cooking over a campfire, go with the A-5. If your cooking is limited only to cooking on a dutch oven table, then I would go with the 9-inch Camp Chef lifter. If you are ground or bean-hole cooking then I would take a long look at both the Camp Chef 14-inch and 22-inch lid lifters before deciding to buy this Lodge A5DLL Deluxe Lid Lifter."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 28, 2013', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great', 'author': 'Deron L.', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Works as it should', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 15, 2023', 'is_verified': True}]"

So I had a new recipe (Roasted Chicken Noodle Soup) that I wanted to try for a few years, and it suggested the use of a Dutch Oven. I couldn't bring myself to part with 3 Benjamins for a LeCruset, because I wasn't familiar with the different manufacturers of cookware, and the alternatives available. Additionally, my wife choked on her drink when she saw the price of them, and laughed like I had lost my mind.I had decent results without using a Dutch Oven with the recipe, but I wanted to use what the recipe called for. We were in the grocery store, and saw that they had a Lodge Enamelled Cast Iron 6 qt on sale, and the color matched most of our appliances (red). I purchased it, and used it twice, and I while perusing Amazon the other day, saw that I could get the same one for $10 less. Well, I had a bit of buyer's remorse, and read the reviews for the same model, and saw that a lot of customers were complaining about the coating flaking off, and there were several pictures to support their reviews. At the bottom of the page, the listing for the Marquette product came up, so I clicked on the link. Initially, I liked what I saw, and there were multiple reviews with a 5 star rating. Pretty impressive, but when there's less than 100 reviews, compared to thousands for the other products, it made me wonder why they were getting such good reviews, compared to the other alternatives. It turns out they are a new company, looking to get into an established industry, with new and attractive designs for their products. I have to say, the logo caught my eye. Additionally, the fact that they offer a lifetime warranty on the pot is another reason that I chose to purchase this product. Not many guys think about what their cookware looks like, but aesthetics does play an important role for the customer, as well as the warranty. Nobody wants to bring a ratty casserole dish to the potluck, or have it crap out after a couple of uses.I did a video of the unboxing and comparison to the Lodge model of the same capacity, and have attached it to this written review. I gave the product 4 stars for the lid. I know it's not supposed to sit flush to allow for some venting, but I was expecting it to sit evenly across the circumference. My video review shows this in effect. It's almost like the lid is warped, but I know cast iron doesn't warp. I'm not sure if this is an intentional design.The Lodge does claim to be a self-basting product, with the design of the lid, and judging by the design of the smaller circles on the lid, it would appear that the Marquette was designed to have condensation collect on the lid, and then drip back into the pot via these raised edges. Clever design.I do like the completely flat bottom, which will allow me to use it on our stovetop with the larger element, as compared to the smaller base of the Lodge.

Plus, after 16 years living as a Michigander, I love that this is a Michigan company! The only reason for the reduction in rating (I wish there was a way to make it 4.5 stars) is the knob on the lid. It is metal and rectangular in shape to accommodate the company logo, and as other reviewers have also mentioned the corners are SO SHARP - to a point where I’ve wondered if it might be helpful to use a dremmel to file the corners down some. I’ve also considered purchasing a new knob from another manufacturer to replace it.

Both performed well but, with some marked differences. The Marquette Castings oven handles stayed cooler to the touch for a longer period of time during cooking and the roast also cooked more quickly and made a thicker gravy. The Le Creuset took about 45 minutes longer to cook a similar size roast and I had to use slightly higher heat to get the gravy to thicken. Also, the Marquette lid seems to fit more tightly. There was also no sticking of anything to the bottom, while the Le Creuset had a little meat that stuck to it. Perhaps because it was the first use for the Marquette. I have had the Le Creuset for about 5 years. As it was a discontinued colour and I paid only a little more for it than this pot, I would put them pretty even. If I paid the full retail (about three times as much), I would favor this pot. So, it's a standoff until the Marquette ages a bit. I am very curious to see how that works out due to the super affordable price. Time will tell but, very happy with it on this first outing."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 26, 2017', 'is_verified': True}]"

Highly Functional and Lovely Enameled Cast Iron Dutch Oven With Stainless Steel Accents', 'author': 'Kenneth', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'This review is for the LODGE Enameled Cast Iron Dutch Oven (Size - 4.5 Qt, Color - Blue). I received a free taxable sample of this Dutch oven to review in my search for a well-constructed Dutch oven.The Dutch oven arrived within a branded and decorated brown cardboard postal box with manufacturing and marketing information on all sides. Inside the box were the Dutch oven, instruction booklet, and bag of six pot protectors underneath the cardboard sleeve around the matching lid. This can be gifted as is within the box and tied with a bow and ribbon, or optionally wrapped in giftwrap with a gift tag attached.The Dutch oven weighs 8 pounds and starts with a 7 1/2"" circular base that then rises approximately 4"" and expands to a 10 1/4"" outside diameter and 10"" inside diameter at the top of the rim. There are two rounded handles located opposite of each other that extend 1 5/8"" from the side of the pot and have a starting width of 6"" that then tapers in to 5"". The opening on each handle measures approximately 1 5/8"" by 3 1/2"" across. The matching lid weighs 4.2 pounds, has an outside diameter of 10 1/4"", and has a T-shaped stainless-steel handle screwed onto the top of the lid. The handle measures about 2 1/4"" across at the top and is 1 1/4"" in height. The pot and lid are constructed in the USA of cast iron and the surfaces of the pot and lid are covered with a blue-colored enamel coating on the outside and a light creamy-white colored enamel coating on the inside. The only parts of the pot and lid that are not covered with enamel are three stainless steel accents (the lid handle and two branded nameplates on the handles) and two circles of exposed cast iron on the top rim of the pot and the bottom edge of the lid.As per the information booklet, the Dutch oven is oven safe to 500F and I have been primarily using this for baking sourdough bread. The even heat distribution from the cast iron construction and the heavy lid to trap the steam have been essential elements in making a fantastic loaf. Added bonus is that this size allows me to fit two pots into the oven at the same time to bake more efficiently. Outside of baking bread, this pot has worked great for the standard casseroles and stews, and I\'ve used it in a pinch to sear some items before finishing them directly in the oven, but I typically use a cast iron skillet for that.Besides being functional, the aesthetics on this Dutch oven are quite nice with the stainless-steel accents, the artful curves on the pot itself, and the concentric circular ridges on the lid. I was apprehensive at first about the blue color being too bright and loud, but in reality, it feels like just the right shade of blue that gives the kitchen a pop of color without being obnoxious. Cleanup has been pretty straightforward, and I recommend sticking with the hand washing and prompt drying as recommended in the care instructions. As with any enameled cookware or bakeware, there has been a slight darkening and decrease in the glossy coat on the exterior and interior bottoms from use.All in all, this Dutch oven is highly functional with a nice look, good enamel coating, and solid cast iron construction. I recommend this as an excellent option for a Dutch oven that has excellent cooking capabilities and the benefit of being easy to clean.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 28, 2023', 'is_verified': False}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars this is the way to go for my bean/meatless based vegan concoctions', 'author': 'Robert Strecker', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I am not skilled in the kitchen, so that means i like to make easy things with emphasis on meatless grounds, along with various beans. I do not like having to keep the pot i am using simmering forever out of fear that i may leave the burner on. I am clumsy like that so its helpful to have a pot that can trap heat inside more so than regular pots. There are many other reasons i like to have a high temperature pot, such as the ability to remove it from the heat and have the internal build up heat take care of the rest. With this Dutch oven style pot from the Lodge USA brand i now have that cast iron design that allows for greater heat conductivity. I eat vegan often though am not totally vegan. I have found out that with meatless grounds you do not have to worry about the intricacies of real meat which is an artform; however the beans, whether they are white or kidney beans as well as chick peas, a Dutch oven can work wonders with infusing extra flavor form the included ingredients. This Lodge USA pot had a glossy dark blue color, which matches nicely with my kitchen and a set of blue pans i have displayed.I have not seen the spike protrusions on the lid for condensation release before because i am more familiar with the bulbous lid nodes which do the same thing. I like the pointy type this lid has on this Lodge USA lid. I feel the lid on any Dutch oven pot is a standout feature due to the way it handles the inner water. I like the protective rubber material along the perimeter or rim; because i often run into dinging the outer sections of lids like this.I am familiar with this brand and have always been happy with them.

This dutch oven is one of the best quality cooking implements I\'ve ever seen. It offers the best of cast iron and ceramic in a single package, and its appearance is just striking. It works great with either induction or traditional stove tops, and in the oven. The heat distribution of cast iron ensures your food will be cooked evenly no matter where it\'s arranged in the pot. You also get worry free cooking of acidic foods like chili and pasta sauces, because the surface won\'t pit. Clean up and storage is super easy - no bothering with ""seasoning"" or oiling the surface. You can take it from oven to table and it will probably outshine any other serving dish there.It comes with rubber (or maybe silicone) clamps to avoid chipping in storage, and the manual warns you against using metal utencils, so it is somewhat more delicate than straight up cast iron, but I will take this over mucking around with seasoning and babying the surface any day.The construction and finish are just beautiful. It\'s solid and well made, and makes it so easy for your food to turn out fantastic that if you have kids, they\'re likely to fight over who gets this when you\'re gone.It\'s heavy, but the handles are well designed to make moving it around simple.I just can\'t say enough good things about this.

See attached image.The build quality is really nice. As it is made from cast iron, it is pretty heavy and holds a lot of heat. The ceramic coating makes the surface nice to work with and I found it easy to clean. This dutch oven can be used on the stove or in the oven, or both!The only drawback of the ceramic coating is that you cannot use anything that can scratch the surface – metal utensils and scrubbing pads can damage the ceramic.

The lid handle is tall, making it easy to grasp with pot holders. Unfortunately marketing seems to have won out over function on the pot handles. The metal inserts have screw heads on the underside and enough space both top and bottom to accumulate crud. My husband pointed out that it also weakens the actual handle by thinning it out. I got the 3 qt. size because it fits our life. It cooks wonderfully on the stove and oven. The bottom is just enough smaller than the top so that a silicone bread sling is a little too big. (I’ll keep looking for a slightly smaller one, so far no luck) I would prefer straight sides. However, I got rid of a plain cast iron oven because I pretty much stopped using it.

It holds 2 loaves. I can bake a white loaf and a grainy or herb loaf at the same time. I shape the loaves to be oriented the long way on the buttered pan bottom. The lid is soaked for about 20 minutes in cool water. I put the covered cooker on a cookie sheet into the cold gas oven and and set the temp to 400 degrees F. I bake for 40 minutes. Then, I take the lid off and put it on my towel-covered counter. I am careful not to shock and crack the clay. The bread is pale, but it has terrific oven spring and looks moist. I cook it for about 20 more minutes at 425. Then, I dump the bread out onto the cookie sheet, bottoms up. I put the Eurita bottom on the towel covered counter. The bread bottom is pale, so I bake it for about 5 more minutes. I check the bread's internal temp. It should be about 200 degrees F.In addition to the bread, I made the best corned beef in my Eurita. It was tender and juicy. While it is true that meat doesn't dry out if you cook it too long, you can ruin the texture. I did that with a chicken that I overcooked.Some tips: Start cooking in a cold oven. NEVER subject your clay pot to sudden temperature changes. Always have a towel-covered surface ready to place your hot Eurita. Wait until it is completely cool to wash it. DO NOT use soap on the unglazed parts. Use a soft brush to clean the unglazed parts. Baking soda can help with greasy areas. The unglazed part does discolor. It gives the clay pot character. Let it air dry completely before storing. Have a storage place where it won't get knocked around and broken.This is a wonderful kitchen tool!

Baking in a closed vessel traps steam to help give a boost to your oven spring. You can do it in your Dutch oven, so why this dedicated piece? Does it bake better? Not exactly. But it does bake a beautiful loaf. And its design with a shallow base and domed lid make handling it much easier.The major difference in this vs a Dutch oven is that you can remove the dome shaped lid easily mid cook, and allow more of your loaf to get direct heat from the oven so the crust comes out even. In that regard its design is great. The included instructions/recipe say to let your loaf proof right in the pan, covered. Which does work just fine. You can also proof normally in a basket if you like - it still works great. Some people have concerns about preheating Dutch ovens empty - I’m of the opinion that it’s fine because the whole thing is heating slowly and evenly with the oven. So I sometimes preheat this as well. Most often, I preheat the dome only, just so I’m not dealing with a 450 degree pan when I’m trying to put my loaf into it.The only negative - and it’s minor - is the rings and logo on the base. They prevent you from using the bread oven for anything else besides baking bread, so this is a true unitasker. I don’t need the bottom of my loaf to have circles and a ay le creuset on it (like the Dutch oven lids (see photo)). I’d rather have a smooth surface making it easier to slide a spatula underneath so I could use it for other things too.If you like baking bread, and find some therapeutic joy in the process this is a worthwhile purchase. If you’re more of a utility baker, there’s other options much cheaper that would work the same. Lodge makes a cast iron 5qt double dutch that has the same shallow pan as a lid, which mates to a Dutch oven to create basically the same design. its not enamel coated but it gets the job done just as well.

Of course this would compromise the whole outer shell eventually leading to chips and cracks. The finish under the lid lip was likewise chipped and nicked. I was so disappointed in the lack of quality. I own over 10 pieces Le Creuset - both vintage and newer models. They are my prized possessions. However the old manufacturing standards seems to have slipped quite a bit with this Le Creuset bread oven. The product listing did not state it was a second. With the flaws it would not be considered to even qualify as a second. The pock marks in the glazing was apparent as soon as the box was opened. Is there no longer quality control? I would like to point out there is a design flaw. Since the handles are flush with the bottom of the pan, removing this heavy bread oven would be awkward at best. You would have to drag the pan across the rack in order to grasp the handles from the edge to remove. The handles should bend upwards to allow an easy grab and lift without scraping up the base of the pan by dragging it.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 31, 2024', 'is_verified': True}]"

I’ve been thinking of clearing out my cabinets of old mismatched and missing lid cookware and replacing it all with updated and efficient pieces. When I saw this Dutch Oven I was anxious to add it to the new collection. At 3L, (14”W x 2.44”D and 11.4 lbs) it’s a great size for dishes that need a larger vessel than a regular skillet with rather shallow walls or a CrockPot or ovenware when I want to prepare just enough beef stew or whatever for a couple meals. Using this will allow me to make a variety of meals without dragging out an unnecessary larger pot that will require more clean up and isn’t needed for smaller quantities. The lid has has a Raindrop Design that gathers moisture in the form of condensation which will go back into the food. Never dry cook and always add liquid, butter or oil to the bottom of the pan PRIOR to heating. This pan does require seasoning along the rim and instructions for doing so are included in the packaging. Metal utensils should not be used on the enamel nor should metallic pads or brushes be used when handwashing. Never use a knife to cut inside the pan or on enamel. Avoid sudden temperature changes and NEVER submerge a hot pan into cold water. I won’t even run water over a hot pan as I was taught it could cause warping. HAND WASH ONLY Dishwasher cleaning is not recommended and if you have burned on food it is to be soaked in hot, soapy water and then hand dried after it has been cleaned up. Never store while damp. Try not to bump against other cookware or hard surfaces/objects and avoid stacking as the enamel on the inside or outside could be damaged. It can be used on any cooking surface and care should be taken to not let flames lick the sides when using open flame as in when cooking on a gas stove. Only a gradual low to medium heat should be used as this yields the most even and best results for most cooking tasks. Only keep on burner for the necessary time for cooking or boiling and do not overheat empty cookware. Remove from burner promptly after food is cooked. This pot retains and distributes heat throughout and will keep your food warm after it is removed from the heat source. Don’t scoot or slide the pan onto/off/across ceramic glass stovetops as it may cause scratching. It is oven safe up to 500’F/260’C.

I find all of them to be of a similar quality and they all provide a very similar cooking experience.This is more of a braising pan than a dutch oven, but the quality is still on par with the brands I mentioned above. The one (very minor) exception is the choice of screw to attach the handle to the lid. This one uses a washer between the two, which could collect grime and germs. The highest quality brands use a tapered head screw that seats flush with the inside of the lid.As you can see in the photos, the style of this dutch oven (two-tone paint fade, integrated handles, round lid handle, white interior) runs parallel to all the other brands which, arguably, are all some degree of a copy of the original Le Creuset. One thing to note is that the lid on this one has the dimples for collecting condensation and returning it to the stew. Some brands have them, others don't. I don't have a strong preference either way.The heft of this is significant. If you haven't used cast iron before, it will be heavier than you expect. This is a design feature, however, and not a flaw.The lid fits _perfectly_ onto the pot. Like all the premium brands of dutch oven, the interface between the lid and pot has no enamel coating. The metal-on-metal collisions would chip enamel very quickly if it was there. Bare metal for the contact point is the way to go.The cast used to make the cast iron was in good shape. Neither the pot nor the lid have noticeable seams, nor do they have ground seams (that scar where the manufacturer had to grind down the protruding seam caused by two ill-fitting halves of a lousy mold).Overall, I'm very, very pleased with this braising dish.

If you’d like more detailed information please read beyond the Pros/Cons and see the pics.Pros- Heavy duty- Very nice lid- Excellent heat retention and distribution- Perfect size for dinner for up to a 4-person family- Attractive- Can be used on any type of cooking surface (gas, glass, electric, induction, grill, or oven)Cons- No broiling- Worried about flakingI was so excited unboxing this that I made a delicious casserole in it the day that it arrived. It takes time to heat up, just like all cast iron, but once it’s up to temp the heat distribution and retention are very impressive. The lid is awesome, allowing for proper redistribution of water as it collects. Unlike normal cast iron, you only have to season the very edges (black parts) of this dish, so you’ll need to remember to always use oil/butter when you fry anything up in this, or the sticking will be terrible.My only real concern with this dish is that after my first use I found a small flake missing from the inner enamel. I had only used a silicone spatula during cooking and one of the soft-scrub silicone sponges for cleanup, so there was NO way that I had scratched it, but it definitely wasn’t there before I started. It does make me worry that flaking may occur over time. For now, this is only a one-star deduction, because it’s so minimal (the size of the tip of a pencil), but I will absolutely update my review right away if I find that spot is getting larger with time or if other spots pop up.Overall I’m very happy with this Dutch Oven.

And, I've used both Lodge & Le Creuset and I like Staub better for two reasons: 1) The dark surface of the interior is BETTER on a Staub. Le Creuset tends to have stains you can't get out, and browning meat sticks to the inside of a Lodge pot like glue, which ruins the crust on your meat. Staub tends to be much more non-stick and good at browning, also easier to clean. Maybe it does stain, too, but you can't see it. 2) The spikes on the inside of the lid send condensation back into your dish and make your meat come out tenderer.

The non-stick surface pitted and I decided to replace it with stainless steel this time. It's difficult to find a well made stainless Dutch oven for a reasonable price. This Ecolution was about the cheapest I could find. It did have some things going for it. I actually like a glass lid for a quick peek of what's going on in there. It also had the aluminum encapsulated bottom to spread heat evenly. That said, don't expect All Clad results from this pan, watch your heat so you don't burn your sauce. The handles are solid enough and the knob on the lid doesn't get too hot. One of the best attributes is the shape and design. So many Dutch ovens have too tall of sides. The Ecolution is shaped just right for braising in the oven. I'm not a fan of the way the lid sits on top, and the side walls are a little thin so food tends to scorch on the sides (that's why I took a star). Since it's stainless cleanup is a breeze if you soak it with a squirt of Cascade (or just throw it in the dishwasher). Overall it's a nice Dutch oven for the money.Update 6/23/2021: Mea culpa. I deleted a negative review and I am updating my review (again). I've completely reversed on this. Yes the lid rattles when boiling something, but it's just a signal. After several more uses it does spread heat fairly well and you can simmer things on low without scorching them. What I've learned to like about this Dutch oven is the stainless interior. You do have to be careful not to scorch certain foods such as chili or marinara, just keep the heat very low, but the ability to sear certain foods properly is a plus. It turns out I'm keeping it after all. Sometimes you need a non-stick, other times you need stainless.

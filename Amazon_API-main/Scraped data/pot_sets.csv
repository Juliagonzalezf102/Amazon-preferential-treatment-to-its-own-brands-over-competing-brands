I have looked at this cookware before and have seen a few advertisements on it. In the past, I hesitated trying it since, in most of the pictures and videos, it looks like it has a bumpy or rough interior. When I saw the 7-quart hybrid sauce pan, I decided I had to try it to replace a 7-quart Staub Dutch oven that I have. I was so impressed by this sauce pan, I decided to buy the 12-piece set of this cookware. This set was shipped in two boxes. One box include the 6-piece pot set with lids ( 2 and 3 quart pots and 8 quart stock pot), and the other box included the 6-piece frying pan set with lids (8, 10, and 12 inch frying pans with lids).I cook quite a lot and have quit a lot of cookware of various types and brands, including Staub, Le Creuset, cast iron, , Tramontina, carbon steel, Calphalon stainless steel, and Ninja Premium cookware. In most of these, I have complete, or almost complete, sets of every piece available in each type of cookware. Each of these has their pros and cons, and all are very non-stick aside from cast iron and carbon steel that must be well seasoned.Since this review is for the HexClad cookware, I will not get into the pros and cons of each type of cookware, but will compare the HexClad cookware to some of them and let you know why I prefer this cookware over some of the others.It should be noted that it is suggested to wash and season the cookware with vegetable oil before using. I used Crisco shortening which I also use on my cast iron pans. When I seasoned the pans, the oil was completely absorbed. After the initial seasoning, these pans should not need to be seasoned again even when cleaned with soap and water. Cast iron and carbon steel pans should be seasoned after every use.So, what do I like about this cookware as compared to the other cookware I have?1 - Cast iron, and enameled cast iron is very heavy and must be seasoned after every use to maintain it. This cookware does not required seasoning after it is done initially. Carbon steel is not as heavy, but must also be seasoned after every use.2 - Stainless steel cookware needs to be cleaned very time with Bar Keeper's Friend to keep it clean and shiny. The HexClad cookware does have stainless steel on the exterior, but is easier to keep looking shiny since cooking is not done on it. Wash and dry works.3 - Most of the cookware mentioned above can be relatively nonstick when used and seasoned properly and after learning how to use it. Stainless cookware can be more challenging since temperature and what you cook can be issues. Cast iron, carbon steel, and even enameled cookware depends on persistent seasoning after every use aside from the Ninja Premium cookware that maintains a nonstick, easy to clean surface as does the HexClad cookware. Other than Tramontina cookware, the nonstick surfaces of most are durable.4 - As for weight, the cast iron and enameled cast iron (Staub and Le Creuset) are the heaviest, carbon steel comes in second, and HexClad and Ninja are about the same.5- The warranty for HexClad is lifetime vs. the Ninja warranty that is 5-10 year depending on whether you register cookware on the Ninja website. For the HexClad cookware, you must save your purchase receipt.This is all of the differences I can think of for now. If I think of more, I will add them. For now, I am impressed with the HexClad cookware, but I will not likely eliminate much of the cookware I already have. As mentioned previously, each has their own benefits. I may eventually decide to eliminate some of the heavier cookware as it is more difficult to use. I may also eliminate cookware that requires more maintenance.I will update this review if my opinion changes. I hope this review was helpful for you."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 12, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Really are worth the higher price so far.', 'author': 'Fuzms', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Lately I had been treating pans as almost disposable.

Yes, they are scratch resistant, NOT scratch proof.These are not your typical nonstick or stainless steel skillets. They are designed to work with the functionality of both styles of pans.

Everyone is a critic. Everyone complains the pans aren\'t non-stick. It also turns out that none of these people giving the pans terrible reviews seem to have the faintest idea how to cook in the first place.If you dump scrambled eggs into a dry non-stick pan of any make or model, they\'re going to stick. And probably burn. Every single YouTube review tries the ""egg test"" by putting an egg into a hot, dry pan and guess what happens? If you dump frozen ravioli into a dry non-stick pan, they aren\'t going to thaw, much less cook, and they\'ll have scorch marks. If you try to make fried rice in a non-stick wok but don\'t use a drop of oil, the rice is going to stick and burn. If I tune into your HexClad product review and you tell me that you had to go to the store to buy vegetable oil to season the pans because you don\'t normally use any in your cooking, I\'m going to turn that video right off.So here\'s the deal: Are HexClad non-stick pans? Yes. And also no. They are hybrid cookware. But they are unique hybrid cookware unlike any I\'ve owned or tried. Must you use some oil in your cooking? 100% yes. It\'s actually in the instruction sheet that comes with the pans. Also, it\'s proper technique. How else are you going to ensure proper heat transfer to the food? Again, think about what you\'re buying here: hybrid cookware. A hybrid of what? A hybrid of non-stick cookware, which, no matter the brand, still will require some kind of oil or fat to be properly non-stick, and of stainless steel cookware, which most definitely requires oil or fat to be non-stick.The bottom line on this whole ""they aren\'t non-stick"" nonsense is that they most certainly are. When you want them to be. When you use proper cooking techniques.Now, how did they work out for me? I\'m not a chef. I\'m a home cook. But I like to think I\'m an above average home cook. Two of my good friends are foodies. One of them actually is a chef. The other is a skilled home cook and recently purchased a set of HexClad, which he really likes. We often cook and eat together.First test, after following the seasoning instructions, was with the 12"" pan. I made sichuan chicken using boneless, skinless chicken thighs. While skeptical at first, I heated the pan on medium low as instructed, thinking no way is this going to be hot enough. With a little oil in the pan once it came up to temperature (within 2 minutes at that), the chicken cooked and even browned. Developed a nice sear on the outside. Beautiful, gorgeous color. And yet, when turning the meat it released from the pan with zero resistance and no residue left stuck on the pan surface. Removing the chicken, I added a tbsp more oil and in went the peppers and onion. Again, a gorgeous result. Nice searing and no sticking. Added the meat back, added sauce, and the same meal I had prepared the night before in my quality non-stick skillet actually looked far more appetizing. And it was delicious. I dare say, even better due to the increased Maillard reaction over standard non-stick pans. Clean up entailed a wet sponge and a gentle wipe and rinse and it was clean. Nothing stuck. No discoloration. Soap and water finish.After enjoying my meal, I just had to know if the pans were going to pass the test that would make them a keeper for me: the French Omelette test. So I heated up the 10"" pan, scrambled and seasoned three eggs, and threw a knob of butter into the pan. Medium low heat was plenty enough to get the job done. I worked quickly, keeping the eggs moving to avoid forming large curds. Once nearly set, I began rolling. The egg came away from the pan without a single stick, and without even the need to add more butter to release it as I would in my regular non-stick pans. Perfect, soft, yellow (not browned), creamy French Omelette. Clean up was a non-event. Aside from a bit of butter there wasn\'t anything for the soap, water, and sponge to remove. This test sealed the deal for me.I have other decent pans: All-Clad D3 12"" and 10"" pans, and three non-stick Oxo 8"", 10"", and 12"" pans (top rated by America\'s Test Kitchen). The All-Clads can work okay, but they were mostly a disappointment. They take too long to heat up, the heat dissipates quickly when food is added, and they have cold spots around the outside where there isn\'t direct flame. The Oxo pans are actually pretty great, but they have rubber handles which can\'t go into the oven, and even medium heat just isn\'t hot enough. Not the pan\'s fault, but you\'ll never get a sear on a non-stick surface. My goal here was to have ONE set of pans that could get proper searing, could be used in the oven, and still have non-stick properties. I have achieved that goal with the HexClad pans. My All-Clad and Oxo pans will be gifted to someone. I have no need for them anymore.Handles: Nice, fat handles on the HexClad that don\'t turn in your hands or get hot. The worst thing about the All-Clad D3\'s are the handles. I have nearly dumped the contents of both pans when tossing as the handles rotated in my palm. They are the absolute worst. I absolutely LOVE the HexClad handles.Lids: Every HexClad pan came with a nice, glass lid that fits perfectly, and has a steam vent. All-Clad? Because my D3 set didn\'t come with lids initially, All-Clad doesn\'t and won\'t sell them separately. I called All-Clad when I got them and asked if they\'d sell me some lids and they basically told me to go pound sand. They were actually rude and dismissive.Heat distribution: As mentioned, the All-Clad D3\'s didn\'t evenly distribute the heat to the outsides of the pan surface that weren\'t directly over flame, nor did they keep the heat when food was added. Even cranking the flame up to high was never enough to get a good sear. Not so with the HexClad. I was sure that the warning to not heat them above medium had something to do with the non-stick surface (and it might), but it\'s just not necessary to go any higher. The outsides of the pan are just as hot as the middle and they sear so well, keeping their heat even as food is added. They perform almost like carbon steel or cast iron in this regard.Non-stick: Covered this, but it bears repeating that these actually are non-stick when used properly.Appearance: They\'re gorgeous, aren\'t they? My friend\'s set has no discoloration after several months of daily, hard use, and he\'s never had to use Barkeeper\'s Friend or any scouring. They are absolutely stunning under the LED cook lights of my hood. Prettier by far than the All-Clad.I\'ve ordered the 2, 3, and 8 QT pot set, which arrives tomorrow, and expect to be equally happy if these pans are any indication. I also have a 10"" wok arriving next week for my near daily stir fries. At some point, I may also add a 1 QT pot and 7 QT deep saute.The bottom line is that these pans aren\'t going to miraculously make you cook better.

I have looked at this cookware before and have seen a few advertisements on it. In the past, I hesitated trying it since, in most of the pictures and videos, it looks like it has a bumpy or rough interior. When I saw the 7-quart hybrid sauce pan, I decided I had to try it to replace a 7-quart Staub Dutch oven that I have. I was so impressed by this sauce pan, I decided to buy the 12-piece set of this cookware. This set was shipped in two boxes. One box include the 6-piece pot set with lids ( 2 and 3 quart pots and 8 quart stock pot), and the other box included the 6-piece frying pan set with lids (8, 10, and 12 inch frying pans with lids).I cook quite a lot and have quit a lot of cookware of various types and brands, including Staub, Le Creuset, cast iron, , Tramontina, carbon steel, Calphalon stainless steel, and Ninja Premium cookware. In most of these, I have complete, or almost complete, sets of every piece available in each type of cookware. Each of these has their pros and cons, and all are very non-stick aside from cast iron and carbon steel that must be well seasoned.Since this review is for the HexClad cookware, I will not get into the pros and cons of each type of cookware, but will compare the HexClad cookware to some of them and let you know why I prefer this cookware over some of the others.It should be noted that it is suggested to wash and season the cookware with vegetable oil before using. I used Crisco shortening which I also use on my cast iron pans. When I seasoned the pans, the oil was completely absorbed. After the initial seasoning, these pans should not need to be seasoned again even when cleaned with soap and water. Cast iron and carbon steel pans should be seasoned after every use.So, what do I like about this cookware as compared to the other cookware I have?1 - Cast iron, and enameled cast iron is very heavy and must be seasoned after every use to maintain it. This cookware does not required seasoning after it is done initially. Carbon steel is not as heavy, but must also be seasoned after every use.2 - Stainless steel cookware needs to be cleaned very time with Bar Keeper's Friend to keep it clean and shiny. The HexClad cookware does have stainless steel on the exterior, but is easier to keep looking shiny since cooking is not done on it. Wash and dry works.3 - Most of the cookware mentioned above can be relatively nonstick when used and seasoned properly and after learning how to use it. Stainless cookware can be more challenging since temperature and what you cook can be issues. Cast iron, carbon steel, and even enameled cookware depends on persistent seasoning after every use aside from the Ninja Premium cookware that maintains a nonstick, easy to clean surface as does the HexClad cookware. Other than Tramontina cookware, the nonstick surfaces of most are durable.4 - As for weight, the cast iron and enameled cast iron (Staub and Le Creuset) are the heaviest, carbon steel comes in second, and HexClad and Ninja are about the same.5- The warranty for HexClad is lifetime vs. the Ninja warranty that is 5-10 year depending on whether you register cookware on the Ninja website. For the HexClad cookware, you must save your purchase receipt.This is all of the differences I can think of for now. If I think of more, I will add them. For now, I am impressed with the HexClad cookware, but I will not likely eliminate much of the cookware I already have. As mentioned previously, each has their own benefits. I may eventually decide to eliminate some of the heavier cookware as it is more difficult to use. I may also eliminate cookware that requires more maintenance.I will update this review if my opinion changes. I hope this review was helpful for you."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 12, 2023', 'is_verified': True}]"

It is nice that they stack but they don\'t stack perfectly as 2 pots seemingly are the ~same size width.We have gas (LP) at home too, and the flames are blue as is optimal, but there is black soot? or something that accumulates on the bottom of the pan, and only mechanical rubbing will remove it (not dishwasher); unsure why, would be interested if others have same trouble using LP gas with their Carote set. This stuff gets on fingers when handling the cooled pan. I don\'t seem to have that on my stainless steel Viking pots/pans that I use for everything else.Perhaps it is the raw aluminum exposed spots (see round dot & pie-slice pattern on bottom) that are just oxidizing with heat & oxygen exposure.

If it’s a static item such as candle holder or a vase which whole purpose is to stand there and “look cute” then sure,why not,but pots and pans? Common now :)Let’s get back on track,I’ve purchased this set in August of 2023 and HAVE used it quite a bit. Durability, efficiency, reliability and quality. The set is very affordable for those who are looking to invest into “decent” pots and not break the bank. For those who care to match it to your kitchen,then yes,it IS very estatic and doesn’t make you hate your life every time you throw spaghetti in it. I can’t say that I’ve used it “properly” 100%,there’s been a few times where I’ve used a fork to turn a pancake over and OH MY GOSH of course I scratched the surface. Which is….okay. Because it’s not meant to be used with metal forks and spoons and the packaging says so,so I am not taking any points off for that. The handles are very sturdy and even though,6 months later I am still feeling uneasy to pick it up just by the handle alone if it’s full of boiling water thinking it will somehow unclip and burn my so many times sunburnt legs again…it never happened and yes I have carried a full pot of boiling water ACROSS my kitchen and waltzed back with it to the stove. Bottom line-the handles are GOOD and reliable. They are extremely easy to clean,by hand or dishwasher,so why 4 stars you might wonder…Ahhhhh,well…they ARE easy to clean INSIDE…BUT,the bottom of the pans for some weird reason have this black grease on it that wouldn’t come off for the life of me and oh I tried to get it off!

UPDATED REVIEW TO REFLECT GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE', 'author': 'Chris', 'rating': 4, 'content': ""I purchased these pots and pans as a Christmas gift for my wife, who is the primary cook in our household. Initially, we were impressed with their aesthetic appeal and the comfortable feel they offer. These cookware items are notably lighter than our older Calphalon set, making them easier to handle. It's worth mentioning that while the handles have a wood-like appearance, they are not made of wood and will burn your hand if you touch them while hot.In terms of performance, during our limited usage, they have demonstrated even cooking, which is a significant plus. Furthermore, following the manufacturer's recommendation to allow them to cool down before cleaning, we found them exceptionally easy to clean.However, the main issue we encountered relates to the handles. Although they have an attractive design, we experienced a durability concern. During the very first use, while boiling eggs on medium heat, a portion of the handle unexpectedly broke off with a loud pop. We were surprised to find a piece of the handle on our griddle cover. I've attached pictures taken immediately after this incident, including one of the underside of the handle.In summary, we are quite fond of these pots and pans with the exception of their durability. Given this issue, we are considering returning them and exploring alternative options. We are also looking into the possibility of getting a replacement pot to prevent any safety concerns related to the handle. It's worth noting that our experience may be an isolated incident, as we haven't come across similar reports in the few Amazon reviews we've read. I'll update this review to share the resolution once it's reached.UPDATE 01/11/2024:After posting my above update, I planned to reach out to Carote. I was not able to do so that day and when I was about to do so two days later, I noticed I had already received an email from Carote Brands via my Amazon account. By reaching out to me, they saved me additional time of having to reach out to them. They resolved the issue in a way which leaves me completely satisfied and will to try their products going forward. As for our pans, they have been working really well. I am still continually surprised at how light weight they are based on how the look. The non-stick feature has been very good as well. Even when letting melted cheese dry in the pot, I soak it in water for about ten minutes and then everything wipes out with a sponge. I haven't had any issues with cooking food or cleaning the dishes. Due to the warning in the packaging and the warnings in the instructions, we keep a cloth between the pans/pots that we are stacking to protect the material. I have updated my 2-star review to 4 stars to reflect their excellent customer service and the quality of the product, with the exception of my first review.

This is just my take on PTFE, non-stick, PFAS health concerns etc. For various versions of the question ""is this product PTFE free?"", there are many \'Yes\' answers in the Q&A\'s for this product, but some say it does have in fact PTFE. So what is true? To say it upfront, according to my findings it does contain PTFE. But that doesn\'t necessarily mean this is a bad and toxic product. In fact if you want Non-stick and something that lasts longer than ceramic non-stick this is probably a decent product at the price point and good somewhat healthy option! I say \'somewhat\' because it\'s complicated and everyone has a personal threshold of what they consider healthy!If you are interested in more depth why I think that please read-on. I\'m not a chemist, just a curious consumer. I had ordered this set during Holiday \'23 sales events and fell for the marketing of Eco-Friendly, PFOS,PFOA No Lead, No Cadmium. There is also only one spot in the product description where it says PFAS free (Image with Mom and Daughter prepping food) However after the fact I looked at the Q&A and it started to stress me out. Greenwashing is everywhere, so caution is warranted. I set out to find out the truth, but it\'s difficult and hidden. And of course as usual it\'s complicated. The company would do better if all their products would actually be present on their website and provide honest information about each, but as of Nov \'23 there are only 3 products on the website with zero info. Product Info is rather hidden and spread across several blog posts and it\'s hard to understand what actually applies to what. There is only a couple blog posts where it is said that Carote uses DURIT Granitec HL. This is a non-stick coating made by the Swiss company ILAG (that info is also hidden in blog posts and mentioned by some in the Q&A here.) ILAG is a massive global brand and a leader in the coating industry. After digging on ILAG\'s website I found the PDF for the product https://www.ilag.ch/fileadmin/dateien/Dokumente/Prospekte_Hoch/Broschueren_EN/Cookware/Leaflets/40640_Leaflet_DURIT-GRANITEC-HL_EN.pdf which very clearly states that the Basis is PTFE. So the statement in the image with the Mom and Daughter that the product is PFAS free is false. This could easily just be an honest mistake by some marketing person who confused the facts her/himself (hard to keep it all straight, PFAS, PFOA, PFOS, PTFE etc. ;) But it should never happen and it misleads people thinking they are getting PTFE free cookware, when they don\'t. PFAS is an overarching category for over 9000 chemicals of which PTFE is just one. The really bad PFAS offenders in the Non-Stick market used to be PTFE made with PFOS & PFOA (again, all are PFAS) which have been phased out of the market in 2015, since they had serious health concerns and regulations finally caught up with that fact, so most products nowadays should be be PFOA and PFOS free and most Non-stick products proudly claim that on their packaging/marketing. There are newer chemicals that replaced these 2 for PTFE which have potentially new and unknown health concerns (or not, they could be safe). But Carote claims to have none of those and their product is 100% free of APEO, GenX, PFBS, PFOS, PFOA. ILAG\'s Durit Granitec adheres to stringent European guidelines which all in all makes this a pretty safe PTFE choice.The larger question: how bad is PTFE (broadly known by the brand name Teflon) really? For many people that seems to be an automatic Oh NO and TOXIC etc. It probably gets such a bad rep because it used to be made with PFOA and PFOS and can\'t shake that bad image. Newer formulations like this one from ILAG might actually be totally fine. The claim 100% Non-Toxic (which is also used in Carote\'s marketing) is technically true. PTFE is considered Non-Toxic under normal cooking conditions. And again a lot of the really bad PFAS are not in Carote\'s coating. But if you end up accidentally overheating your pots or pans it can start to break down and release harmful fumes, apart from losing its performance (rather rapidly according to some reviews here) as well. That is the main problem with PTFE based Non-stick. So for me that is a big BUT ;) and ultimately lead me to returning this product, since I have a bad habit of doing that and we have a gas stove where it\'s easy to do.The bottom line is if you want true Non-Stick you are making compromises and taking on a risk of having potentially harmful effects to health in your cookware, regardless which one you choose. They all have their own potential health risks. Many different formulations out there. Some Ceramic can claim PTFE free, but has it\'s own issues and also struggles with longevity. How high that risk is, is hard to say and in many instances still unknown and again everyone has their own risk tolerance. We live in a world where we are surrounded by thousands of chemicals and the majority of PFAS or other harmful substances or metals that end up in humans do not come from our cookware, there are dozens of more concerning pathways. And the risk of them is very real! If you don\'t want to take that risk from your cookware go with Cast Iron, Carbon Steel or Stainless steel and learn how to use those (which is what I\'ll be doing).If you are disciplined and treat this product the right way (no high heat, no dishwasher, no abrasive cleaning, avoid all scratching.) This is probably a good and reasonably healthy non-stick coating and as good as it gets at this price point.Which should be noted as being at the low end for cookware, you can easily spend hundreds and hundreds of $ on higher quality. There\'s also a sea of brands that are very close to identical to Corate that all use the same marketing. It\'s so obviously the same template it\'s silly. Imarku, Sansarte, Michelangelo, Vkoocy, Hausfrau etc. Seems almost endless. So these are either white label brands that not only offer the product, but the marketing package along with it or one big company that is flooding Amazon. Or some other selling scheme on Amazon. Quite annoying that whole trend, everyone\'s a seller these days. So who knows what sort of company you\'re actually dealing with. And if this brand name goes under because mediocre or bad reviews like mine become too prevalent, they just shut it down and start the next one. BUT It doesn\'t necessarily mean the product is junk. It looked and felt nice and sturdy and I was on the brink of keeping it. But due to my overheating concern (and the dodgy marketing annoying me), it\'s not for me.

If you don’t, and something sticks, put a half tsp water in the pan and cover with the lid for 15-30 seconds, it will be unstuck. It’s a whole new slippery game when trying to flip things.

The set pieces were wrapped but weren\'t in it\'s original box inside the shipping box, (not sure what that was). Everything looked new and intact.These cook evenly and with a lower heat than I have previously used, but that keeps things from burning and allows them to cook evenly through. I haven\'t tried to fry crisp fried sliced potatoes and the like because I avoid that much oil. I try to eat healthy and these are perfect for that. Great for veggie and chicken stir fries and the like. Also great for frozen family-sized dinners packages with pasta. I love the 7"" egg pan for all kinds of eggs, chicken breasts or burgers for one. I am sure I could do anything easily.I love how solid they are. I love how well the lids fit (solid too) and and you can see through to check the food.I love how all handles are covered with an almost rubbery material that makes them easy to grip and heat free.I love that as soon as I plate the food, I can turn to the sink, empty any leftover food I don\'t want to save, rinse with hot water, add a drop of soap, and use my sponge wand to simply wipe away any oil or minor pieces of food, then rinse, and turn them over to drip dry while I eat.

The metal is thick and the ceramic (?) melded coating seems thick and solid as well. I suppose if I burn stuff too often, fail to get the oil or left over food cleared while washing, or am not careful with the handles, they could wear out sooner rather than later. I hate warped pans or sticky surfaces, but these don\'t seem apt to do that if I follow normal care and correct heat and attention while cooking. I haven\'t used the dishwasher because they are so easy to rinse out.I can\'t believe how solid they are for the sales prices I paid... and I intentionally bought when they were on sale.

I used to boil milk to make my coffee in the morning, and I can't pour the milk from it into my coffee cup without making a mess. But that's a minor concern and there are other ways to heat up my milk for coffee.

However, the breaking point came when I moved to a new home with a gas stovetop.Unfortunately, the set did not react well to direct heat. While the nonstick surface held up admirably, the bottoms of the pots and pans started to show signs of damage and emitted an unpleasant smell. Understanding that direct heat is notorious for affecting pans with coatings, especially non-stick ones, I decided to part ways with the set.It's important to note that I don't attribute the set's shortcomings to its quality. In fact, it performed well considering the circumstances. Direct heat can be harsh on coated pans, and these held up nicely despite some wear and tear.

This was a huge disappointment. They came with instructions, and I followed them… I only use plastic cooking utensils and medium/low heat when cooking, etc. I was hoping they would be great, so I could purchase another set when we move into our house, but I am just disappointed.

I contacted the company and all they said was that they were still safe to use. Don’t get me wrong! I’m glad they’re safe to use despite the scratches.

I was looking into slowly replacing my older cookware one by one since the coating started coming off on some of the pots and pans. I figured I can't really go wrong for the price, since I don't expect them to last longer than 2 years, just like any other nonstick cookware I have owned, whether they were more expensive or not.They look nice. They do feel very light. And either I missed it or they don't mention it in the product description anywhere, but the lids do NOT fit on the pans. First time I had that issue when I bought a complete set. Fortunately, one of my older small pot lids will fit the small pan, but I don't have one for the big pan.Biggest issue: the handle on the small pan seems heavier than the pan itself. Having a gas stove with a large grate/big gaps, I have to position it just right so it doesn't tilt or fall off.Not sure how well the non-stick coating works, since my omelette ended up burning a bit and getting stuck to the pan (still trying to get used to this lighter, thinner pan than my previous one). Sausage left brown residue multiple times. It all cleaned out easily though.Also, the small pot over my gas stove smelled bad - not really burnt, but more chemical - when used for the first time (have not used it again yet, so not sure if that smell goes away over time), and the grate from my stove turned slightly red after using it.The cooking utensils that come with it come in handy. They're nothing special, basically the same quality you'd get from the dollar store, but that works for me.Overall, for the price, it's a good deal.Update: I've used the little pot that smells a few more times, and the smell has not gone away. Smells chemical/like a dentist's office. I hope it's from the outside of the pot.

I had T-fal when I got my first apartment- it was given to me as a gift and my first complete set of cookware ever. So when it came time to purchase a new cookware set, I went through Amazon and saw T-fal- for everything you got in the twelve-piece set, and you couldn't beat the price- and I knew it was top-of-the-line cookware (in my opinion), from previous use.Everything I needed was in the set- except for the bigger cooking pot. So I bought my birthday present for myself. And yes, cookware is a gift item, in my opinion, even when bought for the home- because it is so nice. And there was nothing more that I wanted than some good cookware to make my life easier- and nicer- to make better food for my loved ones.Let me tell you about the video I made to illustrate my point- of how T-fal is top of the line, high quality made and no other line can give you what T-fal does, at the price- Please excuse that I had to make the video by myself. And I had no stick to hold my phone- only one hand and the other- and these old hands have nerve damage and problems so know that I tried my best.I mixed an egg and poured it into the bare pan- meaning no butter, no oil, just the egg mixture (which was only eggs beaten in my mixing cup). Watch as I cook it (one-handed, the other videoing), and how nothing sticks, it all came up great-- you can see for yourself how nothing sticks!!And, in the video- look and see that there are no signs of oil, butter, or anything that could help the egg not stick. (And excuse the large scraper- while I could have used the one that came with the set- I figured instead of unpacking it, I'd use the one that we had out). All that is there to help prevent sticking is the wonderfulness of T-fal's non-stick technology. Honestly, it was all amazing- to again cook with T-fal and see the wonders of great heat distribution (which also helps the non-stick), along with the non-stick elements.Had I known what would happen next, I would have kept the video rolling but one-handed and all, I quit as early as I could- not knowing how to edit videos either (yet). But I took the pan to the sink to wash it- all I really needed to do- and did- was take a paper towel and wipe the access off. And then it was sparkling clean- nothing left to wash. The picture I included after the video was the pan after it was wiped out with a paper towel, no other cleaning was needed (or done). Especially since no butter or oil was used. And even though the egg was a little bland without anything to grease the pan- I added a little salt and thought how much better my health would be- without clogging my pores with oil and butter.All the T-fal in the set are that amazing. And while I would add more photos of it- the pan is the smallest of the set that I used- all the others look as they appear online in photographs- you don't really need my extra photos because they look the same at home as they do on Amazon.I think the set I had was great for me when I was younger- because at that time I hadn't mastered cooking in a way that made me want to be patient- cook right- and spend the time doing it. Youth can be that way. This is why this set is great- it makes up for the error of youth and the impatience- because that is normally when you are going to get things that stick to the pan- with that kind of attitude. So if you are looking for anyone's set of first cookware- you have found it.But now I take the time to cook and do it well. Even master complicated dishes that take a long time.- however, I want some good cookware to do this. T-fal is still the best for me. Also- for those health issues I have- I would like to cut out added butter and oil- especially when I use it just for the non-stick element and the recipe would be great, still, without it. As you saw in my video- no butter or oil is needed.I am so happy that T-fal has stayed affordable, and even become more affordable over time. This whole set was an amazing price- I didn't pay more than $10 per item- with all that was included- which is amazing when you look at the quality. A small pan that works this well should see for over $20 on its own.Thanks to T-fal for being such a large part of my life- and making it so much easier with the best cookware ever!Please note: I shot the video with one hand to work on everything, the other was on the camera. Sorry I'm not really set up to make great videos- wish I was but I tried my best to show how great the pan is. Also, the second photo shows it after cooking the eggs in the pan and I used a paper towel to wipe out whatever didn't land in the bowl. What was left- a clean pan needing no further wash!!Addition to Review on 11/13If you watched my video, you see that I used a metal spatula- which isn't the best idea with T-fal. If you want to keep the great results of the pots and pans, use the included plastic spatulas and spoons- While nonstick seems like magic, it needs to be treated well to keep working. I just wanted to add this- so people don't follow my bad example. My husband actually reminded me of this, after seeing the video and chiding me on my bad decision, so I don't ruin our new pots and pans (and my birthday present to myself). Isn't that the reason we keep em' around ;)?"", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 27, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': ""4.0 out of 5 stars decent product, but not great. I'll explain"", 'author': 'Kaniki', 'rating': 4, 'content': ""I bought the black 12 piece set. I have only cooked with them once so far and made eggs in one and cooked maple flavored sausage links in the other. Here is my impression of them. First, the final impression in short and to the point, then why I felt that way..The cliffnotes (short) version..Nice lids that fit on both, the pots and pans.. decent handles on the pots and pans, but not great.. easy to dent pots and pans.. very very cheap utensils.. Ok for single person, couple, or starter set.. Not great if you have kids (you know that they will get damaged 10 times faster with kids around) or if you like caramelizing things like meats to make gravies to stews.. OK for the price but not worth retail. Non stick works, but dont expect the slide around egg effect like you see on TV.. Made in china..Full, Description version of my review...The 3 utensil pieces (spoon, flipper, etc) do work, but I'll be honest, I have bought some in the past at the dollar tree, that were, yes you guessed it, a dollar, and they were made much better. The ones included do work but are not very strong, nor do I think that they will hold up to much use over time. But hey, you didnt buy this set for the utensils, you bought them for the pans, so what do you expect. they will work fine until you get to the store (or order off the net) to buy better ones.The lids to the set are pretty well made. they have plastic over the handles will keep you from burning your hands if you have to remove the lids and feel like it will hold up OK over time. there is a plastic, or silicone spacer between the handle rivets and the glass so that should help protect the glass from breaking due to the metal up against glass. Also, the lids fit perfectly on both, the fry pans and the pots, so you have a way to cover both without having to worry about splatter.. Just cant do both at the same time obviously.Now for the pots and pans.the handles feel decently made. Not great, but pretty good. On a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being great, i would give the handles a 6.. maybe 7 if i was feeling generous. They feel like they will hold up to normal use with no problem, but dont try to abuse them or you may have problems. and it may not be the handles fault, it may be the pot or pan part itself.The Nonstick coating works good from what I have seen so far. I cooked eggs in one, and did not need to use any butter to keep them from sticking. The eggs did not slide around like you will see them do on TV, but they did not stick either. They came right up with no problem and did not break the yolks either. The sausage links I cooked in the other pan never stuck either. I washed both out and dried them by hand and you could not see any kind of mark like they were ever used. so the coating did not peel at all, nor did cooking the food leave any marks.Now for the bad.. the aluminum that the pots and pans are made from is not extremely durable. When taking them out of the packing, one of the pots hit up against the flat pan, and guess what.. It dented.. Yes, that little hit was all it took. I have other good quality pots and pans with non stick coatings that are made out of aluminum too, and they can get hit 5 times harder and not dent.. The aluminum in these is a bit of a softer aluminum, so you have to watch or expect a lot of dents in your pans. But on the positive side of that, because of they way and type of aluminum that they are made out of, they are also light.. it is kinda like comparing whipped cream cheese to brick cream cheese.. one is much softer and lighter.. that is these.Another downfall, which I was not happy to find out, was that they were made in china. I did a search on amazon for american, or USA made pots and pans.. These were at the top of the list. Obviously I should have checked into it a little more and not trusted amazon to be accurate here, and for that reason, I did keep them, after all, they will work fine for what I want, but just to be clear.. China made, not American!!!One things that I never see that I would like to point out though, especially for first time buyers of non stick cookware. Non stick does have its advantages, like not having to use any kind of grease or oils when cooking, but at the same time, there is one major flaw to non stick coatings.. you can not brown food.. I have heard it as browning, glazing, caramelizing, etc. These cook the food fine, but you know how you take a roast and brown or caramelize a roast so that it gets that nice brown glaze in the bottom which is really good if you plan on making home made gravy, or for flavoring the stock in a roast so the flavor goes into the other foods when you cook a roast.., From what I have seen, any non stick pan i have ever used sucked at giving any kind of that browning or caramelizing. It cooks the food with not problem, but you dont get that bit that makes good flavoring or gravy material. If you plan on it, get a pan that is non stick for that purpose.. then after you do the initial caramelizing of the meat, then put all that in these pots if you want. but that is one major draw back to non stick coatings on cookware.Overall, they are not bad, but not great. They will work fine for a single person, or for a couple. For a decent first set, they are not bad either. If you are someone that gets their pans knocked around a bit (maybe put it in the sink then put stuff on top and clean everything later), then expect to get a lot of dents in these over time. Considering that you get these for under $10 per piece, they are not bad for the price, but i would say average priced for the set. I would not pay anywhere near the retail price for these because they are not worth that much, in my opinion at least. If they were more expensive, i probably would have given a 3 start instead of 4, but I tool price into consideration vs quality when I gave it 4 stars. In the end, it all depends on how you cook as to if these are good for you. Personally, I'll take my old club aluminum pots over these any day of the week.. but that is just my opinion. But also, luckily for me, these are for someone else, not for me, so i dont have to worry about it. :)........................................Update on info about them...according to the manual, they are good for gas, spiral or solid electric, ceramic (radiant) and halogen rangetops.also, the temp rating on them for the oven is.. 350f/175c with plastic handles or stainless steel handles with silicone inserts. 450f/230c for full silicone handles. 500f/260c for handles made completely out of aluminum or stainless steel. cookware with soft touch translucent portions is not oven safe. and never use them in the broiler."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 18, 2014', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars The Ultimate Cookware Set for Every Kitchen!', 'author': 'Atahan D.', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""The T-fal Signature Nonstick Cookware Set is a game-changer in the kitchen.

The ""stacking"" thing is great, works as promised, very little time to do it.Not an ounce of ""scratched off"" paint yet, which is great.Back to cleaning though: Nothing sticks. Wow. Swish around them with appropriate sponge, and/or slide into dishwasher. Every meal we have every size we need, with lids. Lids are flat, and that helps with stacking.Could this have been an ounce more perfect? One silicone handle that fits the handles of all pans, so one doesn\'t ""eye that metal handle with suspicion"" when cooking... The handles are sturdy, beautiful, but they do get a little hot.

If you're cooking for yourself or maybe one other person, the pots and pans are perfect.However, I do suggest that if you regularly cook for multiple people and you buy this set, get an extra, larger frying pan. The larger of the two that's provided is not really adequate if, say, you're sauteing two whole onions for a full pot of soup, or if you want to make a quesadilla using large tortillas. Because I mostly cook multiple meals' worth of food at a time, I don't use either of the frying pans in the set all that often. I also never find a use for the smallest saucepan.I've also found that the utensils are of somewhat questionable quality. In particular, they don't react too well to heat. I'm not sure if it's from normal use or from one of my roommates frequently leaving it resting on a hot frying pan, but the end of the spatula has some damage from melting or burning, which causes small strips of black plastic to fall off occasionally. And there are several deep gouges in the handle caused by letting it rest on the edge of a hot pan and melting.But the bottom line is that this is a very nice cookware set at a pretty good price.

It has only been a couple weeks though, so can't comment too much on longevity. But in terms of cooking and cleaning, they worked well enough without any complaints. The sizes are okay, may be on the small side for more than two or three people though. But for a couple or for college, these are a good set to pick up.

I have been listening to her speak about what type of cookware sets, and mysteriously asked her what brands names does she like, she mentioned brand names as well as the amount of pots she would like in her cookware set. I saw this Cook N Home 12 Piece Stainless Steel Set on the Amazon website, and I thought for the quality, style and discounted price, this would make an excellent gift.I viewed different types of cookware available during the holiday season. I was surprised by the different sizes, prices, variety, and quality of these sets. I decided to purchase this Cook N Home 12-Piece Stainless Steel Set. I was concerned that since the price was discounted, would the quality of this cookware be durable enough for the type of food she wanted to cook in this set. I know that food can sometimes be compromised because the pots are not durable enough to cook the food while maintaining the taste of the menu/recipe in the final results of cooking.I was concerned about whether the food would taste great in this cookware set based on the price. I started to ask her about different cookware brands, she mentioned a few manufacturer brand names she previously knew, as well as brands she saw on the Amazon website that she was interested in purchasing.I ordered this set for her as a Christmas gift, she was extremely surprised, appreciative, and her family thought that it was a great gift, and gesture on my part to give her something that was needed, appreciated, and of great quality. She did wait until Christmas to open the gift, although she is someone who loves to open gifts early. I would and she would definitely recommend this cookware set to others, as well as Amazon Customers who are looking for a quality, durable, and reasonably priced stainless steel cookware set. This set is efficient for all your cooking needs. She stated that it was packed neatly/securely, and delivery was timely. When it arrived, she did not know what it could be and wanted to guess what I could have purchased for her, coming up to the time of Christmas Day, she promised she would not open the gift until Christmas, although guessing everyday what could it be inside the large box.She was extremely surprised; her family appreciated the gift since they would benefit from more varieties as cookware would not be an issue to receive more selective dishes at mealtime. She is very happy with this gift, and appreciates that I was listening all year as she kept stating that she wanted another cookware set. She likes the fact that it looks much better than she could have anticipated, definitely a quality stainless steel cookware set, cooks nicely whether frying, steaming, stewing, or using to bake some meals, and very easy to wash.

As my hands have gotten older and have some issues I\'d been searching for lighter weight pans with double handles. They are not easy to find! Finally came across these. Very reasonable priced. Cooking in them is good and the sizes are better for us at this point. Cleaning them is easy and do they do well in the dishwasher too. If something looks like it will be a little harder to clean I put a little water in them and heat it a few minutes then there\'s no problem. For me there are 2 cons... I don\'t care for the way the handles are attached having the ""buttons"" on the inside makes it so you can\'t stir smoothly around the sides. In all fairness I haven\'t found any double handle pans that don\'t have the handles attached like that no matter how expensive. Without the long handles the pans take up way LESS space and stack great! Now my biggest pet peeve...The edge of the pan is curled under but not smooth so it creates a wonderful spot for water to sit in after you\'ve washed so when you pick up a pan water goes all over you and the floor. The handles stay cool and I don\'t need an oven mitt to handle them BUT the handles are hollow and not sealed so they can have quite a bit of water in them too. Let\'s just say I\'ve had to dry the floor more than once! Would I buy them again...Yes...I needed this type of pan with double handles they work very nicely on a glass top stove and are good sizes for us.

Overall this is a pretty good deal for how cheap they are. I\'m thinking it\'s time for an upgrade, however. I am an avid home cook, and in addition to this set I use a variety of frying pans.The first thing I need to say is this: if you have not used stainless steel and are used to non-stick, you have some learning to do! Do your research and learn how to use your cookware. The biggest things to remember: preheat your pan before adding food and use plenty of oil. If your meat sticks, that\'s a good thing; just wait until it releases on its own to move it around the pan. Later you can add some liquid (water, wine, vinegar, stock, etc.) to deglaze or release all of the lovely flavorful browned bits on the bottom of the pan. If you are a novice, I would recommend that you continue to use non-stick for delicate foods like eggs and fish.Now that that\'s out of the way, let\'s get to the review.UseabilityThese pots will boil water! Perfect for making pasta, ramen, and anything with copious amounts of liquid. The bottoms have a tendency to scorch when there isn\'t as much water present, so you\'ll want to stir frequently. I\'ve made fudge, caramel, and toffee in that dutch oven, and it only scorched at the very end. I\'m used to this, and it just means that I can\'t scrape the bottom.The frying pan has deep walls, so it will trap moisture and cause less evaporation than a pan with lower, sloping sides. I don\'t use this one very often, opting instead for non-stick (for ease of use and of clean-up), carbon steel, or cast iron. Again, these pans don\'t fare so well in a low-moisture setting.The handles are odd. Typically with the two-handled pots, one handle will get hot and one will stay cool during the cooking process, and that\'s if I use the correct burner size.The lids have vents, but they still rattle loudly when your water comes to a boil. It kind of works as an alarm so that I know the water is boiling - like the whistle of a tea kettle.DurabilityThe casserole/dutch oven type pans are what I use the most, like one would use a sauce pan. Those have held up really well, and with a little bit of Barkeeper\'s Friend would look brand new. These are lightweight and probably won\'t take much of a beating, but with normal use they will last just fine. I haven\'t had any lids break on me, either.The fry pan, however, has a warped bottom. Within a few months or so, the encapsulated bottom formed a 2-inch bubble, so it doesn\'t sit flat on the stove top.The handles are hollow, but I haven\'t had problems with strength. None of them have bent or buckled.Clean-UpFood comes off of these just fine, although sometimes they require a good soak. We have hard water, so spots are inevitable, and sometimes the ""rainbow"" effect is too, but with some Barkeeper\'s Friend they shine like new. My roommate blackened the entire bottom of the frying pan, and I anticipate that it will scrub away just fine, because that powder is magical.The hollow handles like to collect water, so I make sure to let my pans dry thoroughly before hanging them back on my wall.The Bottom LineIf you\'re a casual home cook, a broke college student, or just someone who needs to boil water, I highly recommend this set. It\'s cheap and it works. If you have more money to spend and are looking for quality cookware, you should probably go for something else, but it\'s hard to be disappointed by a $45 set of pans.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 10, 2018', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Say Goodbye and Good Riddance to Non-Stick Coating Forever', 'author': 'NLT of NM', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""For my health, I decided to get rid of non-stick and plastic. I've been buying cast iron because I know it is very safe. Piece by piece, I've bought all the cast iron basics. And I have some Pyrex for baking. Feel clueless about stainless steel? Well, I sure was. I bought a couple pieces from a second-hand shop and sent all my food to its doom. I was left with very unappealing cookware that has been buried somewhere. I'm not sure where to look, but they can stay buried.Well, I couldn't stay a chicken forever because I'm sure my hair was growing white feathers instead of gray hair. Stainless steel looks very pretty, like something I want to eat off of every day. So I began to look at stainless steel cookware sets on amazon. Then I was ogling stainless steel in youtube videos and cooking videos. Daily, I clucked and pecked at my wish list with indecision because I really didn't want to spend a lot of money for a whole set of stainless steel I'd have to find a new burial place for. This set has only one frying pan, which is exactly what I wanted. Many sets I looked at had multiple pans, but I wasn't looking to replace my cast iron skillets, just add to my cookware choices. I also like the handles on the lids more than the sets with knobs. Easier to grasp with a potholder I think. With the winter weather and holiday season coming up, I enjoy cooking and baking more, so the time had come to do something about my lack of stainless steel. I purchased this set with a hesitant sigh of relief.When the set arrived, I inspected each piece closely before washing. Some of the pieces had very minor dents. I think I only noticed them because I was so anxious, scared, excited - glowing. I had a friend here while I un-boxed, because of course, I had to show off my shopping skills just a little bit.I earnestly began to plan my whole life and diet around testing this cookware. A twelve-piece set cannot be tested sufficiently in an hour or two. I poached eggs, cooked rice, fried chicken, Italian sausage, made berry sauce, cooked dried beans, cooked bacon, fried eggs, made soup, heated frozen vegetables, and cooked pasta. I learned how to clean this cookware immediately after cooking and after letting sit overnight. I developed a fondness for this set that's almost as intense as my feelings for my cast iron. Yes, I'm very attached to my cast iron because of all the time and energy I've put into getting them seasoned just right - including not letting anyone else touch them. I hand clean my new set just as carefully, with hot water, salt, and baking soda. Then I carefully dry each piece by hand - I don't think they will rust from air drying, but they don't gleam as well through water spots.When I buy a double boiler and stainless steel cookie sheets, this new cookware journey will be complete. For now, I'm smiling widely because my stainless steel is beautiful to look at - I didn't ruin any of the pieces. I also didn't burn any of my food because the quality of this set practically guaranteed I wouldn't fail. I know some people think cast iron and stainless steel are hard to maintain, but that's just myth. When used and cleaned properly, the maintenance is a breeze. The alternative, using non-stick is no longer an option for me. I've turned that corner and don't regret it. I have had a lot more fun using this stainless steel set than I could have imagined. It weighs less than my cast iron, so that is a plus when I'm tired or sick. Food cooked in my stainless steel is just as mouthwatering to see as my cast iron. Don't make the mistake to rush the cooking - with cast iron and stainless steel, that is a mistake.When it comes to cleaning, remember that hot water is a friend.

After researching various options, I decided to invest in the Cuisinart 11-Piece Cookware Set, and I must say, I am thoroughly impressed.One of the standout features of this cookware set is its exceptional heat distribution. Compared to my old pans, I noticed a significant improvement in how evenly heat was distributed throughout the cooking surface. I experimented by heating the middle of the pan while placing the food to the side, and the results were outstanding. This even heat distribution allowed for precise cooking and eliminated hot spots, ensuring that my dishes cooked uniformly every time.Cleaning these stainless steel pots and pans was also a breeze. I had expected it to be a bit more challenging, but to my surprise, a simple combination of water and dish soap was all it took to scrape off any food residue and restore them to their pristine condition. This ease of cleaning has made cooking and cleanup much more efficient, saving me time and effort in the kitchen.Aside from their functionality, I am also impressed by the aesthetic appeal of this cookware set. The simple yet elegant stainless steel design adds a touch of class to my kitchen. There's something timeless and sophisticated about the look of stainless steel cookware that I find appealing, and this set perfectly embodies that.Overall, I couldn't be happier with my purchase of the Cuisinart 11-Piece Cookware Set. Not only does it meet my cooking needs with its excellent heat distribution and easy cleanup, but it also adds a stylish element to my kitchen. If you're considering making the switch to stainless steel cookware, I highly recommend giving this set a try.

The kitchen is the center of my home. So when my daughter got her own apartment out west and asked for a set of pots for Christmas, I wanted to make sure I got her a quality set that would last her for years and years. I knew what I wanted for her, but didn\'t know which brand to purchase. Non-stick was out (I have never liked it). The pots also had to be both dishwasher/oven safe, and I wanted the pot handles to be riveted into the pot. Off I went to the mall with my ""specifications"" in hand to look at the different brands and sets available. Boy was I amazed at how many there were! I took my time and examined each set. Not only did I look at the sets, but I also handled the sets. This is VERY important. Many of the quality sets were so heavy that I needed two hands to lift the larger pieces, and although I could lift the smaller saucepans, I had difficulty tilting them to the side to pour. Others had handles that were very uncomfortable to use. Then I came upon the Cuisinart Chef\'s Classic Stainless 10-piece cookware set. I was very impressed by the quality. They were heavy grade yet easy to handle. They also met my other specifications listed above AND they looked really nice as well. The price of $149 was quite unbelievable. I drove home and ran straight to my computer and ordered the set through Amazon. I got free shipping and had the set delivered directly to my daughter. I also used the holiday bonus coupon for $25 off my order. I was so impressed with the set and the deal Amazon was offering, a few days later I purchased a second set through Amazon for myself. I LOVE them. They cook beautifully on my gas range and clean up well in the dishwasher. The handles DO NOT get hot while cooking, which totally surprised me. Do be careful with the lid handles though. They will get hot if cooking on higher heat. I haven\'t had a problem with delicate foods burning due to the high thermoconductivity of the pans; however, my stove is a professional grade 6-burner unit. I don\'t know if that makes any difference or not. All I can say is this set looks great, cooks great, handles great, and sells at a great price. What more can you ask for?', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 13, 2005', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Very happy with this set', 'author': 'Kevin', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I had some older non-stick pans leftover from college, but the non-stick coating was starting to flake off, so it was time for new pans. I really like cooking, so I wanted something that was good quality and would last a long time. Since I was replacing most of my pans, going with a set was the best value for my money. I read lots of reviews about different types of cookware and different brands and finally settled on this set. This is a very good quality set for a great price.As of this review, I have been using this set for 2 months, so I am not able to comment on the long term use of the set. However, everything seems solidly constructed and if properly cared for, I think the set can last a long time. This set had everything that I was looking for. It would be nice if the set included a larger (12"") skillet, but I already owned a 12"" stainless steel skillet that I bought by itself, so it ended up working out for me.If you are used to other types of cookware, especially non-stick, you have to get used to cooking with lower heat and properly prepping the pan so that things don\'t stick. Heat the pan first, then add some oil to coat the bottom of the pan, allow the oil to heat up, then add the food. I have cooked a good variety of foods with this set and have had good results. As always, sometimes things get messed up when cooking, but I am going to blame that on the cook and not the pans. I have successfully cooked fish and eggs (although I typically use my cast iron for eggs) in these pans without sticking. For fish, making sure that the pan and oil is hot enough will allow the fish to slide and not stick when you put it in the pan. A light layer of flour on the fish can also help. Contrary to what many people say about leaving the food alone and that it will release from the pan on its own, for fish I move the pan around to keep the fish sliding for the first 10-15 seconds to allow it to develop a crust, then I leave it alone. No sticking (Alton Brown taught me this [...]). On the other hand, for cooking some things, you want some little bits to stick to the pan, and you can accomplish that too.I don\'t have a dishwasher, so I have only hand washed these pans. I use just dish soap and a sponge most of the time, but every one in a while I use Bar Keeper\'s Friend to clean them up and help keep them shiny. The pans are all still shiny. You can see some tiny scratches on the bottom when you tilt them the right way in the light, but in no way is the integrity of the pan damaged. If you expect these pans to never get a single scratch and maintain a perfect mirror finish, then take them out of the box, hang them up, and never use them. From use and cleaning, the surface of the pans will get some micro scratches, but these in no way affect how the pans work. To make cleanup easier, run some hot water in the warm pan after cooking to wash out what you can and let it soak for a little if there is anything stuck in the pan. Don\'t run cold water into a hot pan and let the pan cool a little bit before running water in it, otherwise you could damage the pan by rapidly changing the temperature. Also, don\'t leave water sitting in the pan for long periods of time. Let it soak for a while if you need to and then clean up the pan. I usually let them air dry for a little, then wipe them down with a towel and hang them back up.The metal lids fit very well with the pans, but because of the way they are shaped, you are not able to cover anything other than the pans (i.e. a plate) like you could with a glass lid. The lids work great for what they were designed for, so I can\'t fault them for that. Be careful, the lids can get hot if you cover a hot pan with them, so make sure you use a pot holder or towel. Because the lids don\'t have a lip that lets you hang them, I grabbed some S hooks from the hardware store and hang them by the handle. I\'m limited on cabinet space, so I have to hang all of my pans and lids, but I also think it is nice because keeps them from banging into each other.The handles for the pans, on the other hand stay cool enough that you can grab with your bare hand (just don\'t grab it close to where it connects to the pan). It is always good to be safe and test the handle first before grabbing, just to make sure. I have had times where the handle was too close to another pot on my small stove and did get hot.The last thing I love about these pans is the lip around the edge. Pouring liquids from these is just amazing. The liquid funnels down to a single point, making it easy to control, and there is no dripping or splashing.I highly recommend this set to anyone looking for a good deal on a set of quality pans.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 12, 2013', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars I am pleased with the appearance and performance', 'author': 'M on Amazon', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'People are too unaccustomed to non-stick style pans. When you choose stainless steel cookware you will need to learn how to cook and clean using stainless steel cookware. If you are an old dog who has trouble learning new tricks stainless steel is not for you.These work great with my gas stove. YMMV. I am used to Anolon non-stick costing 2x+ more than this yet for the price this Cuisinart stainless steel set is pretty nice. I took advantage of the sale on this set which includes the steamer. Cuisinart is discontinuing the steamer piece and is selling off the new old stock. The same set absent the steamer is being sold at a close price. I will never use the steamer but I saved a few dollars getting the set with it and the this set came with clear see-through lids instead of metal.Pros: Beautiful finish, comfortable and balanced long handles on the frying pans, even heat distribution (using gas), easy cleaning, also I like the vibe of chrome and stainless steel cookware on the stove instead of the dark gunmetal of Anolon. I was a huge fan of Anolon for years. ALL non-stick eventually wears out and sticks and you have to replace them. Now I prefer stainless steel. I read how to cook using stainless steel and so far I have have near perfect results of no sticking.Cons: The handles and the glass of the lids get hot and stay hot for a longer time than I expected and am used to. There is more play to slide around and they don\'t feel as well made compared to the 2x+ $ Anolon, again at half the cost of the Anolon I am just mentioning it not complaining.Tip: I read that to clean off stuck on food pour white vinegar and some water in the pan and bring it to a boil. IT WORKS! The first time using the frying pan I fried potatoes and there was some food that easily came off when I boiled water and vinegar in the pan. For actual ""stains"" use Bar Keepers Friend and a non-scratch cleaning pad after the vinegar treatment.

Hwang', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I've purchased two sets about six months ago and had a chance to use every piece. I have to say that this set is a bargain, but noticed that Cuisinart Multiclad Pro is what I would prefer over this set (if money was no object). I've purchased the Multiclad Pro 3 qt saucepan and the 5-1/2 qt pan to compliment this set, and love the true triple ply and heavier gauge sides which prevents scorching. Can't compare this set to the Cuisinart Multiclad Pro set that cost two to three times as much (or All-Clad)...and I'm quite happy that I have purchased this set!As for the 10-piece set, I agree with the high praise from many already posted. This is a very good set for a resonable price. Would it last a lifetime? Probably not but I will get good use out of it for at least ten years. Sides of pan are a bit thin and will flex slightly (compared to the Multiclad models). If the pan fell from my hanging rack, it would probably dent. You can hang the pots with lids on, though one would have to be careful not to knock them off. One of the lids came off and hit the countertop then the floor, but survived the fall without any damage. My favorite is the 3 qt saucepan and the 3-1/2 qt saute.Cameo or Bar Keepers Friend does a good job of cleaning up residue that can't be cleaned up with standard dish washing soap or in the dishwasher. I have some pitting on the interior of pan from throwing salt from soft-boiling eggs or pasta. Pitting does not impact the performance, but a bit ugly looking (doesn't bother me as this set was inexpensive and I've purchased to use everyday). I've done a comparison between the 3 qt provided in this set compared to the Multiclad 3 qt. I was surprised that using same amount of water an at same size gas burners with switching the pans every minute to ensure even heating, Chef's Classic boiled water quicker than the Multiclad by at least a minute (I'm a professional engineer and a bit quirky that way).I've also purchased the anodized non-stick pans by Cuisinart and been using the glass lids from that set on the Chef's Classic. Since purchasing the stainless set, my non-stick pans are in storage and though they are fairly new, teflon started coming off from the top of the cookware where lid meets the pan. I realize the professionals use metal lids as it keeps in the heat better and easier to clean, but I do like to see what's going on inside the cookware when I'm cooking. I'm starting to get used to the metal lids. This set has also retired my Lodge cast iron cookware to use only on the grill, as the stainless base heat retention is great and much easier to clean and maintain.I would highly recommend this set to anyone who wants a long lasting cookware, likes to use metal utensils with their cookware as long as they don't mind superficial scratches(instruction manual states that non-metallic utensils be used), enjoys developing fond (brown bits) for making tasty sauces, or simply wants a cookware that one can abuse without having to worry about ingesting Teflon, this set would be very satisfactory. If you want the absolute best and spend considerable time in the kitchen, spend more for the Cuisinart Multiclad or All-Clad and don't complain about the little details. For most everyone else out there, this set would be quite adequate. Happy cooking!Other Info: As for interchangeability with Cuisinart Multiclad line, 3-qt line has different size lids as Multiclas line has deeper Saute pans. Frying pans are the same size. Pam or similar cooking spray should be avoided as they will bake on to the pans and will be difficult to remove. I've started to cook eggs on real butter mixed with olive oil. Wow! Eggs are so much better than cooked on the non-stick skillet with spray oil.

Shopped around for awhile many sites charge shipping to Hawaii so my only option was Amazon where I found this set! I liked the gray tone and it had all necessary pieces we needed according to the picture!Arrived in a store quality box, packaged well to ensure no damage during shipment.Has all the sizes my family needs from individual size cooking to family size meals!The quality is similar to other brand name pots and pans I’ve owned. Except these have different feelings handles!! It has thick rubbery silicone heat resistant handles. My prior one had some kind of thick plastic handles! These handles are very comfortable to grip while cooking! They did not heat up while boiling spaghetti noodles (See video) I was able to drain the noodles into a strainer without holding it with a kitchen rag!Pots and pans are very lightweight yet strong and nice!! The gray tone really looks nicewith my other gray kitchen necessities!The non stick feels really good while cooking, sauté vegetables was so easy and it slid right off on to the plate! I’m hoping the non stick it’ll last long!!They are very easy to wash, my son who’s chores is the dishes no longer has to soak them over night to remove any stuck on food. He appreciates having these wash so easily!! Well... he’s a teen .. they hate doing dishes to begin with!!! We do not own a dishwasher so I can’t comment on how well it will wash in those but I’m sure it would do great!We’ve been using them daily for well over a month to cook our meals and they are working wonderfully!! I’ve taught my kids how to properly cook with silicone or rubber utensils provided in the set to protect the non stick coating and also how to clean these with a soft sponge so they don’t scratch them up!

Plus, weld splatter (looks like) along edge. All are factory defects, not shipping.I tried to show pics of each major defect. I\'m very disappointed. This could be a nice set. But these sets are either factory defects intentionally sold at a slight discount (without notifying customers) OR there is no quality control at the factory OR the company doesn\'t care if they sell defective items. Either way, with 66% of pot & pans defective it\'s not worth trying a second time and end-up being out another return shipping fee and even longer wait. If the factory had good qc to eliminate defective product getting to the customers I believe this would be an excellent cookware set. BUT as is, it isn\'t. Pros = Nice nonstick, Good fairly heavy weight, Thick hard anodized aluminum, Oven safe, Nice handles on pots & lids Cons = Doesn\'t stack very well for storage, Poor quality control with 66% of pots & pans have major defects.I would not recommend this to friends or especially not as a gift. Odds of getting a good quality set is worse than a coin flip. Not worth the risk (for me). But good luck to anyone willing to chance it. UPDATE: NutriChef customer service contacted me. They have, very quickly, refunded the entire purchase price, through PayPal so I had to create a PayPal account (that I didn\'t want). And they are sending me replacement pcs. Without me having to pay return shipping.NutriChef does seem to care about customer satisfaction or at least not having bad reviews.I will update this review again after I receive the new replacements and have a chance to try them. UPDATE #2: I have received the new replacement set. Two pots are (very) slightly out of round but the lids still fit so not a big deal. The non-stick works well so far but I haven\'t tried the true test of scrambled eggs yet (will let you know).The customer service guy was a pain and seemed more interested in not having a bad review than actually having a good product, but he did refund the purchase price and sent a replacement set. So all is good. Was a one star review but since customer service has taken care of issues I changed it to three stars. Would\'ve been four stars except First set was unusable and the customer service rep should be transferred to a different dept.UPDATE #3: I\'ve had a chance to use all the cookware for several diff types of cooking. I have to say.... I\'m very pleased. One of the best non-stick tests are scrambled eggs. Now my cookware is still new condition, but I\'ve cooked scrambled eggs & crepes without any oil or butter and they didn\'t stick at all. Even the crepes slid right out of the pan.** Would be 5 star review but.... * 4/6 pcs in first set had major factory defects. * Had to create PayPal account to get money back. * Customer Support guy was rude, pushy and kinda hateful. * 2 + weeks to get replacement pcs.But all has been taken care of and I\'m now very pleased with cookware.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States June 3, 2020', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars cook great', 'author': 'juan', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'cool graet', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 4, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Good for the price', 'author': 'Joe S.', 'rating': 4, 'content': ""It's a great set.

The bottom of the grill pan has a 2"" wide circle that is cut into the bottom, reducing the thickness of the pan in this area, most likely to provide even heating. What I don\'t like about the pan is the 12""x12"" area is small, a slice of bacon doesn\'t fit but as it shrinks, it does fit. As per the instructions I use only Low to just about Medium heat, and the pan warped making the center higher than the perimeter. Right in the area of this reduced thickness area.

I finally decided to replace the cast iron with something more functional and came across this Sensarte set after reading many reviews of various options across Amazon.After using them for about a month, I can say I have zero regrets about making the switch, as I am completely satisfied with this new cookware!What I love most is that these are truly non stick. Two of the things I cook most often are pancakes and eggs and I don't even need to spray the pan before cooking and yet both food items slide right off.After I’m done cooking, I rarely have to do anything beyond spray them with water and all the remaining food bits slide right off. As someone who hates cooking because it takes so long to prepare and cook food, and then you only eat for like 10 minutes, and then you have to clean it all up after, I very much value pans that take little to no effort to clean.This set feels quite sturdy and will definitely not warp like some other pans I've tried over the years. They even come with pot protectors, which are equally helpful to protect my cabinets shelves from getting scratched. I was also pleased that they come with a silicone spatula and spoon to help you avoid scratching the surface of the cookware.They’re also so much more aesthetically pleasing than cast iron!10/10 recommend. If I ever need to expand the number of pots or pans I have, I would definitely buy more Sensarte products."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 13, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': ""4.0 out of 5 stars I love this cookware, but I guess I'm in the honeymoon period?"", 'author': 'Nathan Ostrander', 'rating': 4, 'content': ""Our collection of cookware needed a serious upgrade. Neither the wife or I are what you would call kitchen or cookware experts... we cook a lot, but do not find it to be a source of great enjoyment/passion. Nor are we particularly great at it :) That said, I was not super keen to invest in high end cookware that was likely more than we need. I started looking around on Amazon and came across these Sensarte, granite finish pans. I ordered a single skillet in the interest of exploring, based on their slightly retro vibe, solid reviews and low price point. It shipped quickly and performed admirably in addition to being lovely to look at.We then came across the 8 piece set and decided to toss out all the old, burnt out cookware odds and ends we'd been using for a long while. The price point on the set was a major selling point. At this point, we have used them a bit and couldn't be happier... they fit our whole, funky vibe and the price was right. I'm now planning to order a couple of smaller pots/saucepans to round out our inventory.At this point, I can say that:- They feel great in your hand and on the stove. The slightly rubberized handles are quite nice feeling. They are indeed light as advertised.- We start at a low setting and gradually raise the temp as their directions indicate. The heat seems to distribute quite evenly (also as advertised.)- They also clean up quite easily and are also egg-cellent... for making the eggs (see what I did there?)In summation, would definitely recommend for the average household user. Totally possible that someone with more demanding requirements would want to go up a level or 2 higher, but I think we're going to be quite happy with them and you can't beat the price. If they hold up to my heavy handed cooking for the next few months, I'll probably add a star to this review."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 11, 2024', 'is_verified': True}]"

The handles don’t get hot on the stovetop and clean up is a breeze. I’ve used so much less oil than I used to when sautéing or searing and the flame doesn’t have to be as high (I have a gas stovetop) to get the same cooking temp.

The truth is, it's too good to be true. But it is! This is the best cookware set I have ever seen by far. Nothing will ever be able to stick to these lovely pots and pans, no matter what you do, so be ready to say goodbye to all the non-stick sprays, oil, butter and soaking and scratching. They don't even need harsh soaps for a moderate cleaning up. It is true that they can burn food, but the instructions say that these are not meant to be used at high stove-top heats anyway, use a low to mid heat and everything will turn up wonderful. They are really good for slow cooking and can also go in the oven up to 500 degrees, which is required for some food I like to make. The glass lids are useful when making rice or seeing the color of vegetables but they can spill if nor handled properly due to the design, which could certainly improve since they are, unlike the pots, not very easy to clean. My handles have never got too hot unlike my previous Faberware set. I adore the small skillet which is just the right size for a 2 egg french omlete, in general, the sizes are logical and all come in handy. It does say they are metal utensil safe, which is not exactly true since it's OK with a fork or spoon, but any hand held electronic gadget can scratch the interior a little. Also, although the dark gray outer finish is beautiful, it seems that the colour will be wearing of in time.To sum it up, if you're willing to give some extra attention to this good-looking set (drying after hand washing, preferably hanging and keeping the lids clean) this is a deal you must not miss. BTW, It arrived very quickly and was packed great by Amazon. You won't be able to use any piece in this set at high stove top heats, so get a cheap large skillet for that kind of job, give away your old set and buy this one like I did. I doubt anyone will ever regret it. I would give 4 1/2 stars if I could due to the not-so-good lid design facor. Still, I love my cookware set, will probably be using it for at least 10 years to come and recommend it fully to anybody.EDIT AFTER 6 YEARSI've just gave away this set after 6 years of daily use. So, they didn't last for 10 years as I was predicting in my initially overly psyched review, but I still think it was a great deal for the price.

I can\'t believe I\'ve never come across this set before now, but I haven\'t. And I also can\'t believe how absolutely perfect this set is for a minimalist expeditioner, at such an unbelievably low cost. The price is fair as-is, but I would expect it to cost three times as much since inferior designed sets by well-known ultralight brands usually cost a lot more, and since the price of stainless steel has gone up so much in recent years.Here\'s what is amazing about this cookset...PERFECT SIZE FOR ONE OR TWO MINIMALISTS. Usually, a cookset that is designed for two will be appreciably larger, but if you\'re a minimalist and like to keep things simple, there is plenty of space here without overdoing it. The pot holds 24 fl. oz. which means you can toss in a typical can of food, such as chili or spaghettios, and heat it right up without having to fill it dangerously to the brim. It also happens to be exactly the right size for two or three cups of instant hot chocolate, and enough for the water requirements of many prepackaged dehydrated meals. In my experience a lot of cooksets are either a little too small or (far more commonly) larger or more awkwardly sized than they need to be. I much prefer a narrow, taller pot to a really wide, shallow one, but they can be hard to find. This one is perfect.ACCEPTABLE WEIGHT. Backpackers who count every gram may grumble to see that it\'s made of stainless instead of titanium, but the weight will be quite acceptable to all but the most obsessive ultralight folks. The stainless steel is thin enough to minimize weight without being so thin as to deform easily under pressure or heat. I\'ve seen other stainless sets made from such thin gauge metal that they actually ""oil can"" (warp or deform) when they get too hot. Not with this set. I\'ve also seen stainless sets so thick they felt like a brick to carry. Again, not with this set.VERSATILE DESIGN. Nested inside the set are two 10 oz. plastic cups, sized perfectly for a cup of hot chocolate or a small bowl of hot food. They also are quite thick, so they don\'t transfer heat to your hands. I poured in some steaming hot chocolate and could barely feel the warmth as I gripped the cup. That means you don\'t have to wait for the pot to cool a bit before pouring the contents into the cups. The lid of the set is stainless steel and contains a series of small 1/8"" diameter vent holes (a row of six holes on one side, and a single hole on the opposite side). At first glance, their purpose is to release steam to show you when your food is hot, which is already a nice feature. However, I also realized that they are designed so they can be used as a strainer to strain water away after cooking pasta or another hydrate-able food.A small plastic tab on the lid offers a cool place to grab the lid even after several minutes of cooking. Other reviewers have noted that the tab can melt over time, but I suspect that would only be after extended cooking. I saw no problems with melting after six minutes of boiling water. The tab is tensioned so that it lays flat when packed away, but can stand erect while cooking (for easy grabbing without burning your fingers).A folding wire handle on one side of the pot snaps down into place for cooking, and has a small ""spreader"" bar that slides into place so you don\'t accidentally pinch the wires together to release the locked position inadvertently. When you want to fold it up, you slide the spreader bar back, squeeze the wires together, and lift. The handle rotates up and snaps down over the top to hold the lid on (and the contents in) during transit. Since it is wire, it diffuses heat quickly. After several minutes of cooking, the handle was barely warm and easy to hold. It is slightly longer than the handles on other cookware I\'ve used. That, combined with the taller height of the pot, seems to keep it cooler than the (similar) wire handles on other compact cookware I\'ve used.On the pot, there are also measuring marks imprinted in the stainless for 6, 12, 16, and 20 oz. (or 237, 355, 473, and 591 mL, respectively). These marks are visible on both the inside and outside of the pot, so they allow quick, easy measurements when you need a precise amount of liquid to rehydrate a meal or cook to a recipe.OUTSTANDING PRICE: After having owned several nice cooksets from SnowPeak, MSR, and Brunton, each of which cost in the $40 to $80 range, I was not expecting this cheap set to be so nice. It looked good in pictures, but I wholly expected to receive something flimsy or shoddily made. Fortunately, I trusted some of the positive reviews. As it turns out, the set is very well made and should stand up to a lifetime of camping if properly used and maintained.NOTES: The Stanley Adventure Camp Cookset fits perfectly on my MSR Pocket Rocket stove. I built a gimbal mount so that I can use this as the perfect cookset-on-the-go aboard my 20\' sailboat.

The pot is made of stainless steel - thin enough not to be too overwhelmingly heavy, but sturdy enough that it should stand up to the usual rigors of camping/backpacking. I am not too worried about this thing getting squished in my pack or denting horribly if I drop it on a rock. The two cups that come inside it are thick, sturdy cups that can handle hot food and drinks without a problem. Each cup has a mark on the inside of it which is about as high as you\'d ever want to put liquid into it. That mark translates into exactly one cup. In addition to the marks on the cups there are also several measurement markings on the cooking pot itself.My biggest concern before ordering this was the shape/design of the cooking pot. It looked long and somewhat narrow - I was worried that it would be unstable when sitting on top of my Pocket Rocket stove. Indeed, when I put it on the stove empty, it looked and felt like an accident waiting to happen. But once it was half full of water, the added weight really settles it down. I wiggled it and jiggled it and poked at it, and it didn\'t tip over. It held in place securely. I think as long as it is at least half full, it shouldn\'t tip over - even in a fairly stiff breeze.Although it is a bit tall, I don\'t think you will need a long-handled spoon to stir it unless you over-fill the pot. It is designed to cook 24 oz, which goes up about halfway up the top part where the pot flares out. A regular-length kitchen spoon can scrape the bottom easily at that depth.The metal conducts heat very quickly - my Pocket Rocket cooks everything absurdly fast, but it felt like this thing conducted the heat into the water even faster than with some of my other stuff.The lid doubles as a strainer and the little strainer holes make it easy to see steam escaping so you can tell when you\'ve got boiling water easily without having to lift the lid. There is a thing to keep your fingers from getting burned while using the lid. I like that the handle for the lid locks up and is rigid.The handle for the pot itself is also very sturdy and sensibly designed. It locks in place very securely both when it is stowed and when it is extended. There is even a tab you slide up the sides to lock the handle in place so you can\'t accidentally fold it while cooking. The handle is, however, completely uninsulated. Just as the pot conducts heat rapidly - the handle gets super hot almost immediately. I boiled about 2 cups of water on my camp stove - the handle was absolutely scorching hot after that. So plan for a fairly serious pot holder of some kind with this thing.The only real downsides to this unit are the fact that the main handle comes with no insulation and the weight. This set is made of stainless steel - that is why you get so much for so little money. You can get a cook set with similar capabilities made out of aluminum that will be noticeably lighter than this one. If you go up to titanium - you can cut even more weight off. But nothing in life is free. You will spend at least 2x-3x what this cost to get a similar set in aluminum. For titanium - it is more like 5x at least (probably more). This thing weighs just about a pound with both cups inside it. Just how much do you want to spend to shave those ounces off? If you are going solo and want to reduce the weight of this - leave one or both of the heavy green, insulated cups it comes with at home. That would be a meaningful weight reduction.It is dishwasher safe, but they warn you in the instructions that using the dishwasher may ""prematurely age components"". So, in other words, just wash it by hand. I was pleased to see that the bottom of the pot remained shiny and spotless after being subjected to the intense heat of my camp stove. It looks like if you take good care of this thing - it should basically last forever. It is simple and basic, but thoughtfully designed. It is unquestionably a winner for all but the most weight-conscious buyers.EDIT: If you decide to buy this - wash the green cups, then fill them both to the absolute brim with boiling hot water and leave them sit a bit. Then pitch that water and rinse them out. There is something on the inside of the cup that needs to get cleaned out and it doesn\'t come out with just regular hand washing - it only dissolves with boiling hot water. You don\'t want to figure this out in the field. After you do that - it seems fine with hot liquids and actually holds the heat in quite well.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States March 23, 2015', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect for solo camping, coffee kit, minimalist camp kitchen', 'author': 'CoolMatthew.', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""This little set is versatile.

You could easily use a spatula to scrape the sides, no problem.This plastic has a sound like it will crack when dropped, but I have dropped several jars from at least 2 feet above a tile counter without breaking any of them. Good. Well, good that they didn't break.There is a very slight variation in weight between these jars, but most are pretty similar in weight.

Dead bodies turn up, missing items, and imagine finding a newborn infant in the manger of the nativity scene of the Christmas pageant! Trouble finds and follows Lydia everywhere.The author, Sarah Hualde delivers a delightful cozy mystery-style series. This is the type of series that any person would enjoy because it is easy to follow and the characters are straightforward. I enjoyed the blending of Lydia’s practice of Christian faith with her community and family interactions. The mystery around the social influencer was well done and like the other three flowed smoothly and each had good plot twists. The contrasting of the characters was well done also, the mother of the infant found and her best friend proved to be good foils for one another and tested the faith of Lydia as a “foster-like mom.”The narrator, Jasmine Rose, did a good job of narration but did not provide unique voices for the characters. This is usually helpful to distinguish who is talking but also to project the emotions of each character. She spoke clearly and with a steady cadence that kept each story moving forward. I enjoyed her voice very much, and while it was mainly told from Lydia’s point of view, using unique voices for each character would have made it easier to follow.Overall, this is a delightful series and I look forward to hearing more from Sarah and Jasmine.There were no issues with the production or quality of this audiobook.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States November 24, 2022', 'is_verified': False}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Terrific Series so far', 'author': 'Jennifer80319', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'What a humbling terrific read.

For one thing, we have four amateur sleuths to follow. Much is going on in their lives and the lives of their family and friends. The book is busy and fast-paced, but the murder isn't even known to be certain until over the 40% mark—and this is a long book. Maybe the author was hoping to build suspense about the missing man, but when the actual murder in a murder mystery is left for too long, it doesn't allow for much development of the murder plot. This is a long novel, so there was still some time for development, but I would have liked to have seen more. It is definitely a book where it felt like the cozy aspect and the mystery aspect were out of balance, with lots of emphasis on the cozy and not quite enough on the mystery.

However, as the story unfolds, he learns that he has the ability to change his perspective and bring joy to those around him.What makes this book truly special is its engaging rhyming narrative that effortlessly flows like the ocean waves. The repetition and rhythm not only captivate young readers but also make it an enjoyable read-aloud experience for parents. The whimsical illustrations by Dan Hanna complement the storyline beautifully, depicting the underwater world and its lively inhabitants with vibrant colors and expressive characters.As a parent, I appreciate how this book subtly introduces emotional intelligence. It teaches children about the influence of attitude on their interactions with others and promotes the idea that one has the power to shape their own narrative. The transformative journey of Mr. Pout-Pout Fish instills a valuable lesson about resilience and the potential for positive change. 📚✨', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 12, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars It’s hard board pages', 'author': 'Tammy T.', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Loved the story.

As soon as I opened this set, my 8 year olds showed renewed and intense excitement that they now had kitchen toys that were in their words “more real”. They played with them for hours, while our littlest one banged away happily.I highly recommend this set for anyone looking for a realistic quality, or who follows the Waldorf or Montessori guidelines for raising children.I was excited about the cardboard box that they were packaged in, as I find other realistic toy companies to be heavy on the plastic. I was disappointed, however, in the amount of unnecessary plastic on the inside of the box, wrapping each individual item. I had originally docked a star for this unnecessary waste, but decided against it due to the incredible quality of the actual toys themselves. My husband even commented that our children now have a sturdier whisk than we do.1/5/19 Update:We just purchased another set of these as a gift, and they were well received. We have also had several friends get the info to order sheets as well, being so impressed with the quality upon seeing them. Holding up extremely well.

I have looked at this cookware before and have seen a few advertisements on it. In the past, I hesitated trying it since, in most of the pictures and videos, it looks like it has a bumpy or rough interior. When I saw the 7-quart hybrid sauce pan, I decided I had to try it to replace a 7-quart Staub Dutch oven that I have. I was so impressed by this sauce pan, I decided to buy the 12-piece set of this cookware. This set was shipped in two boxes. One box include the 6-piece pot set with lids ( 2 and 3 quart pots and 8 quart stock pot), and the other box included the 6-piece frying pan set with lids (8, 10, and 12 inch frying pans with lids).I cook quite a lot and have quit a lot of cookware of various types and brands, including Staub, Le Creuset, cast iron, , Tramontina, carbon steel, Calphalon stainless steel, and Ninja Premium cookware. In most of these, I have complete, or almost complete, sets of every piece available in each type of cookware. Each of these has their pros and cons, and all are very non-stick aside from cast iron and carbon steel that must be well seasoned.Since this review is for the HexClad cookware, I will not get into the pros and cons of each type of cookware, but will compare the HexClad cookware to some of them and let you know why I prefer this cookware over some of the others.It should be noted that it is suggested to wash and season the cookware with vegetable oil before using. I used Crisco shortening which I also use on my cast iron pans. When I seasoned the pans, the oil was completely absorbed. After the initial seasoning, these pans should not need to be seasoned again even when cleaned with soap and water. Cast iron and carbon steel pans should be seasoned after every use.So, what do I like about this cookware as compared to the other cookware I have?1 - Cast iron, and enameled cast iron is very heavy and must be seasoned after every use to maintain it. This cookware does not required seasoning after it is done initially. Carbon steel is not as heavy, but must also be seasoned after every use.2 - Stainless steel cookware needs to be cleaned very time with Bar Keeper's Friend to keep it clean and shiny. The HexClad cookware does have stainless steel on the exterior, but is easier to keep looking shiny since cooking is not done on it. Wash and dry works.3 - Most of the cookware mentioned above can be relatively nonstick when used and seasoned properly and after learning how to use it. Stainless cookware can be more challenging since temperature and what you cook can be issues. Cast iron, carbon steel, and even enameled cookware depends on persistent seasoning after every use aside from the Ninja Premium cookware that maintains a nonstick, easy to clean surface as does the HexClad cookware. Other than Tramontina cookware, the nonstick surfaces of most are durable.4 - As for weight, the cast iron and enameled cast iron (Staub and Le Creuset) are the heaviest, carbon steel comes in second, and HexClad and Ninja are about the same.5- The warranty for HexClad is lifetime vs. the Ninja warranty that is 5-10 year depending on whether you register cookware on the Ninja website. For the HexClad cookware, you must save your purchase receipt.This is all of the differences I can think of for now. If I think of more, I will add them. For now, I am impressed with the HexClad cookware, but I will not likely eliminate much of the cookware I already have. As mentioned previously, each has their own benefits. I may eventually decide to eliminate some of the heavier cookware as it is more difficult to use. I may also eliminate cookware that requires more maintenance.I will update this review if my opinion changes.

Yes, they are scratch resistant, NOT scratch proof.These are not your typical nonstick or stainless steel skillets. They are designed to work with the functionality of both styles of pans.

Everyone is a critic. Everyone complains the pans aren\'t non-stick. It also turns out that none of these people giving the pans terrible reviews seem to have the faintest idea how to cook in the first place.If you dump scrambled eggs into a dry non-stick pan of any make or model, they\'re going to stick. And probably burn. Every single YouTube review tries the ""egg test"" by putting an egg into a hot, dry pan and guess what happens? If you dump frozen ravioli into a dry non-stick pan, they aren\'t going to thaw, much less cook, and they\'ll have scorch marks. If you try to make fried rice in a non-stick wok but don\'t use a drop of oil, the rice is going to stick and burn. If I tune into your HexClad product review and you tell me that you had to go to the store to buy vegetable oil to season the pans because you don\'t normally use any in your cooking, I\'m going to turn that video right off.So here\'s the deal: Are HexClad non-stick pans? Yes. And also no. They are hybrid cookware. But they are unique hybrid cookware unlike any I\'ve owned or tried. Must you use some oil in your cooking? 100% yes. It\'s actually in the instruction sheet that comes with the pans. Also, it\'s proper technique. How else are you going to ensure proper heat transfer to the food? Again, think about what you\'re buying here: hybrid cookware. A hybrid of what? A hybrid of non-stick cookware, which, no matter the brand, still will require some kind of oil or fat to be properly non-stick, and of stainless steel cookware, which most definitely requires oil or fat to be non-stick.The bottom line on this whole ""they aren\'t non-stick"" nonsense is that they most certainly are. When you want them to be. When you use proper cooking techniques.Now, how did they work out for me? I\'m not a chef. I\'m a home cook. But I like to think I\'m an above average home cook. Two of my good friends are foodies. One of them actually is a chef. The other is a skilled home cook and recently purchased a set of HexClad, which he really likes. We often cook and eat together.First test, after following the seasoning instructions, was with the 12"" pan. I made sichuan chicken using boneless, skinless chicken thighs. While skeptical at first, I heated the pan on medium low as instructed, thinking no way is this going to be hot enough. With a little oil in the pan once it came up to temperature (within 2 minutes at that), the chicken cooked and even browned. Developed a nice sear on the outside. Beautiful, gorgeous color. And yet, when turning the meat it released from the pan with zero resistance and no residue left stuck on the pan surface. Removing the chicken, I added a tbsp more oil and in went the peppers and onion. Again, a gorgeous result. Nice searing and no sticking. Added the meat back, added sauce, and the same meal I had prepared the night before in my quality non-stick skillet actually looked far more appetizing. And it was delicious. I dare say, even better due to the increased Maillard reaction over standard non-stick pans. Clean up entailed a wet sponge and a gentle wipe and rinse and it was clean. Nothing stuck. No discoloration. Soap and water finish.After enjoying my meal, I just had to know if the pans were going to pass the test that would make them a keeper for me: the French Omelette test. So I heated up the 10"" pan, scrambled and seasoned three eggs, and threw a knob of butter into the pan. Medium low heat was plenty enough to get the job done. I worked quickly, keeping the eggs moving to avoid forming large curds. Once nearly set, I began rolling. The egg came away from the pan without a single stick, and without even the need to add more butter to release it as I would in my regular non-stick pans. Perfect, soft, yellow (not browned), creamy French Omelette. Clean up was a non-event. Aside from a bit of butter there wasn\'t anything for the soap, water, and sponge to remove. This test sealed the deal for me.I have other decent pans: All-Clad D3 12"" and 10"" pans, and three non-stick Oxo 8"", 10"", and 12"" pans (top rated by America\'s Test Kitchen). The All-Clads can work okay, but they were mostly a disappointment. They take too long to heat up, the heat dissipates quickly when food is added, and they have cold spots around the outside where there isn\'t direct flame. The Oxo pans are actually pretty great, but they have rubber handles which can\'t go into the oven, and even medium heat just isn\'t hot enough. Not the pan\'s fault, but you\'ll never get a sear on a non-stick surface. My goal here was to have ONE set of pans that could get proper searing, could be used in the oven, and still have non-stick properties. I have achieved that goal with the HexClad pans. My All-Clad and Oxo pans will be gifted to someone. I have no need for them anymore.Handles: Nice, fat handles on the HexClad that don\'t turn in your hands or get hot. The worst thing about the All-Clad D3\'s are the handles. I have nearly dumped the contents of both pans when tossing as the handles rotated in my palm. They are the absolute worst. I absolutely LOVE the HexClad handles.Lids: Every HexClad pan came with a nice, glass lid that fits perfectly, and has a steam vent. All-Clad? Because my D3 set didn\'t come with lids initially, All-Clad doesn\'t and won\'t sell them separately. I called All-Clad when I got them and asked if they\'d sell me some lids and they basically told me to go pound sand. They were actually rude and dismissive.Heat distribution: As mentioned, the All-Clad D3\'s didn\'t evenly distribute the heat to the outsides of the pan surface that weren\'t directly over flame, nor did they keep the heat when food was added. Even cranking the flame up to high was never enough to get a good sear. Not so with the HexClad. I was sure that the warning to not heat them above medium had something to do with the non-stick surface (and it might), but it\'s just not necessary to go any higher. The outsides of the pan are just as hot as the middle and they sear so well, keeping their heat even as food is added. They perform almost like carbon steel or cast iron in this regard.Non-stick: Covered this, but it bears repeating that these actually are non-stick when used properly.Appearance: They\'re gorgeous, aren\'t they? My friend\'s set has no discoloration after several months of daily, hard use, and he\'s never had to use Barkeeper\'s Friend or any scouring. They are absolutely stunning under the LED cook lights of my hood. Prettier by far than the All-Clad.I\'ve ordered the 2, 3, and 8 QT pot set, which arrives tomorrow, and expect to be equally happy if these pans are any indication. I also have a 10"" wok arriving next week for my near daily stir fries. At some point, I may also add a 1 QT pot and 7 QT deep saute.The bottom line is that these pans aren\'t going to miraculously make you cook better. But they WILL reward good technique with superior results. I was skeptical coming into this that I wouldn\'t like them nearly as much as what I already had but any hesitation is gone. The hype is real with this tech.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 16, 2022', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars This was part of the 12-piece set I ordered', 'author': 'Judy L.', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""This was part of the 12 piece set I ordered that was shipped in 2 boxes. I have looked at this cookware before and have seen a few advertisements on it. In the past, I hesitated trying it since, in most of the pictures and videos, it looks like it has a bumpy or rough interior. When I saw the 7-quart hybrid sauce pan, I decided I had to try it to replace a 7-quart Staub Dutch oven that I have. I was so impressed by this sauce pan, I decided to buy the 12-piece set of this cookware. This set was shipped in two boxes. One box include the 6-piece pot set with lids ( 2 and 3 quart pots and 8 quart stock pot), and the other box included the 6-piece frying pan set with lids (8, 10, and 12 inch frying pans with lids).I cook quite a lot and have quit a lot of cookware of various types and brands, including Staub, Le Creuset, cast iron, , Tramontina, carbon steel, Calphalon stainless steel, and Ninja Premium cookware. In most of these, I have complete, or almost complete, sets of every piece available in each type of cookware. Each of these has their pros and cons, and all are very non-stick aside from cast iron and carbon steel that must be well seasoned.Since this review is for the HexClad cookware, I will not get into the pros and cons of each type of cookware, but will compare the HexClad cookware to some of them and let you know why I prefer this cookware over some of the others.It should be noted that it is suggested to wash and season the cookware with vegetable oil before using. I used Crisco shortening which I also use on my cast iron pans. When I seasoned the pans, the oil was completely absorbed. After the initial seasoning, these pans should not need to be seasoned again even when cleaned with soap and water. Cast iron and carbon steel pans should be seasoned after every use.So, what do I like about this cookware as compared to the other cookware I have?1 - Cast iron, and enameled cast iron is very heavy and must be seasoned after every use to maintain it. This cookware does not required seasoning after it is done initially. Carbon steel is not as heavy, but must also be seasoned after every use.2 - Stainless steel cookware needs to be cleaned very time with Bar Keeper's Friend to keep it clean and shiny. The HexClad cookware does have stainless steel on the exterior, but is easier to keep looking shiny since cooking is not done on it. Wash and dry works.3 - Most of the cookware mentioned above can be relatively nonstick when used and seasoned properly and after learning how to use it. Stainless cookware can be more challenging since temperature and what you cook can be issues. Cast iron, carbon steel, and even enameled cookware depends on persistent seasoning after every use aside from the Ninja Premium cookware that maintains a nonstick, easy to clean surface as does the HexClad cookware. Other than Tramontina cookware, the nonstick surfaces of most are durable.4 - As for weight, the cast iron and enameled cast iron (Staub and Le Creuset) are the heaviest, carbon steel comes in second, and HexClad and Ninja are about the same.5- The warranty for HexClad is lifetime vs. the Ninja warranty that is 5-10 year depending on whether you register cookware on the Ninja website. For the HexClad cookware, you must save your purchase receipt.This is all of the differences I can think of for now. If I think of more, I will add them. For now, I am impressed with the HexClad cookware, but I will not likely eliminate much of the cookware I already have. As mentioned previously, each has their own benefits. I may eventually decide to eliminate some of the heavier cookware as it is more difficult to use. I may also eliminate cookware that requires more maintenance.I will update this review if my opinion changes. I hope this review was helpful for you."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 12, 2023', 'is_verified': True}]"

The ingredients used in cooking spray are to harsh for the ceramic coating.Now on with my review:Before purchasing this set of cookwear I did a lot of research and read a lot of reviews for different ceramic cookweare.I selected this set of cookware taking in consideration some of the negative reviews in which I believe people did not take the time to read the do's & don'ts. I also went online and read what kind of oils could be used and not used.Do not use anything abrasive to clean this cookwear. If you have stuck on food soak the pan or pot in warm soapy water for as long as needed.There is no need to add a lot of butter or oil to the pan or pot. Believe it or not your food will cook & brown evenly.Adding a little butter or oil helps the food not to stick and keeps a protective coating between the food & cookware.Use only silicone or plastic utensils that can be safely used on your ceramic cookware.Do Not stack your pan & pots inside one another without putting something between them or they will get scratched.Do Not use high heat with this cookwear because the heat is evenly distributed through out the pan or pot & you only need to be using med to med-high heat.I for the most part use medium heat.Do not deep fry anything in these pans or pots because you will ruin the coating. If you need to fry food use a different type of pan or pot.Now to my review. I got side tracked a little but felt that I had to write the do's & don'ts first.The cookwear was nicely packaged. I wasn't sure if I was going to keep this cookwear because my previous set were heavier, non stick Paula Dean Cookwear.The first thing that I used was the pot to cook red sauce in and was worried that the red sauce would stain the coating. To my surprise it did not stain it. Cleanup was so easy.I have cooked boneless, skinless chicken breast with very little oil and was very surprised of how nicely, evenly it cooked and browned.I cooked four eggs in one of the pans and wanted the yolks cooked all the way. I put a lid on the pan and when I took the lid off a few minutes later the yolks were cooked all the way through. The egg white wasn't even burnt on the edges.Cooking rice is great, easy cooks in no time.Cleaning this cookware is so easy and nice to do.I always wash my pan & pots with dish & warm water.Never use harsh abrasives, pads or sponges.I believe this cookware is wwll worth the money.If you take care of them properly, they will last.

I burned rice in both pots by accident (forgot to set a timer, totally my fault nothing to do with the pans) and they were irreversibly damaged.

I finally decided to replace the cast iron with something more functional and came across this Sensarte set after reading many reviews of various options across Amazon.After using them for about a month, I can say I have zero regrets about making the switch, as I am completely satisfied with this new cookware!What I love most is that these are truly non stick. Two of the things I cook most often are pancakes and eggs and I don't even need to spray the pan before cooking and yet both food items slide right off.After I’m done cooking, I rarely have to do anything beyond spray them with water and all the remaining food bits slide right off. As someone who hates cooking because it takes so long to prepare and cook food, and then you only eat for like 10 minutes, and then you have to clean it all up after, I very much value pans that take little to no effort to clean.This set feels quite sturdy and will definitely not warp like some other pans I've tried over the years. They even come with pot protectors, which are equally helpful to protect my cabinets shelves from getting scratched. I was also pleased that they come with a silicone spatula and spoon to help you avoid scratching the surface of the cookware.They’re also so much more aesthetically pleasing than cast iron!10/10 recommend.

Nor are we particularly great at it :) That said, I was not super keen to invest in high end cookware that was likely more than we need. I started looking around on Amazon and came across these Sensarte, granite finish pans. I ordered a single skillet in the interest of exploring, based on their slightly retro vibe, solid reviews and low price point. It shipped quickly and performed admirably in addition to being lovely to look at.We then came across the 8 piece set and decided to toss out all the old, burnt out cookware odds and ends we'd been using for a long while. The price point on the set was a major selling point. At this point, we have used them a bit and couldn't be happier... they fit our whole, funky vibe and the price was right. I'm now planning to order a couple of smaller pots/saucepans to round out our inventory.At this point, I can say that:- They feel great in your hand and on the stove. The slightly rubberized handles are quite nice feeling. They are indeed light as advertised.- We start at a low setting and gradually raise the temp as their directions indicate. The heat seems to distribute quite evenly (also as advertised.)- They also clean up quite easily and are also egg-cellent... for making the eggs (see what I did there?)In summation, would definitely recommend for the average household user. Totally possible that someone with more demanding requirements would want to go up a level or 2 higher, but I think we're going to be quite happy with them and you can't beat the price.

So I have to use other skillets when I cook a big meal for my family. If I could get bigger skillets at a better price, with lids, and would match my set, this set would be great.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 24, 2022', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Just what I was looking for in a set of pans', 'author': 'donna brown', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Looks great and and easy to wash I love the colorWould recommend', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 20, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Gift', 'author': 'Loren Ashbaugh', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'My wife absolutely loves these pans.

It’s perfect for the single person, college student out on their own or maybe even a couple who doesn’t cook big meals. The pans have sturdy handles, glass covers so you can check on your food without lifting the lid letting heat escape and best of all, thick solid bottoms which is a necessity when using induction. They aren’t heavy, but as I get older, not having cookware that weighs a ton isn’t exactly a bad thing.I wouldn’t necessarily call these pans non-stick. The interiors are polished, but foods stick to stainless steel very easily so you should use butter or oil to help the food along. I tried a couple of the pans and food cooked very quickly on my induction burners. Water was boiling in just a few minutes. They actually performed better than my current set of pans and I think that is due to the flat bottoms of the new pans while my older set is probably warped from use and not making contact as fully as they should.Just a couple of things to know. The covers don’t fit tightly. Not a big deal, but the cover clanking around makes them noisy. There are no instructions on how to attach the metal handles to the glass covers. Just study the photos and you’ll figure it out. There seem to be two different sets of these pans. The photos on this page show thick double handles on the sides of all the pans.

The Simply Calphalon was rated a best buy by CR and I thought that the specs for the Kitchen Aid KitchenAid KCH1S10KD Hard Anodized Nonstick 10-Piece Cookware Set - Black Diamond made them worth consideration. I have been in the restaurant business for over 30 years so I have a lot of experience with pans, mostly professional sets. So that is my point of reference. The Calphalon and Kitchen Aid were in the same mid-range price point (170 - 220) in November of 2015. Truthfully they are very similar but not equal.First thing I noticed was that the Simply Calphalon were slightly smaller. Especially the Saute pan. The Kitchen Aid set is dishwasher safe, Calphalon is not. For better or worse (as you'll read better in this case) the Kitchen Aid are heavier. The Calphalon are double-coated nonstick, the Kitchen Aid are triple-coated. Packaging for KA says oven safe to 350 degrees and Cal. says 400. Amazon says 500 for KA vs 400 for Cal. Being curious I had both in the oven at 425 for 15 minutes with no issues. Both are Hard Anodized aluminum. If you have an induction cooktop only KA is compatable.What is Hard Anodized and does it matter? Hard Anodized pans are naturally nonstick, and completely chemical-free. These pans are made with an aluminum base, which essentially gets submerged in a sulfuric acid bath that has low electrical charges running through it. As it cools, it causes the pans exterior to anodize. A hard anodized pan is extremely strong, has a long lifespan, and because it is virtually non-porous, it resists sticking. Add a few layers of non-stick coating and you have a great, relatively cheap (cost wise), pan.So what are meaningful differences? The most important, and the one most often overlooked by consumers, is that Calphalon set is 3.2mm thick and the Kitchen Aid is 4.5mm thick. Meaning (all else being equal) the Kitchen Aid is more thermally conductive and durable. And my non-scientific tests show this. The KA heats up far quicker, stays at temp longer and cooks more evenly. It's not even close. Boiling water took about 1:30 less time in the KA and eggs cooked over medium heat in far less time. I had to lower the heat on everything I tested with the KA set. It conducted heat far better that my old Cuisinart or the Simply Calphalon. The difference in thickness also accounts for the difference in weight.Calphalon double-coated and KA has a triple-coated non-stick coating. The name is pretty explanatory but does it really matter? Yes and no. Right out of the box there is no noticible difference. However, in 4-5 years there should be a difference. Kitchen Aid's triple-coating should last longer and look better. We'll wait and see.The Kitchen Aid is dishwasher safe the Simply Calphalon is not. Truthfully, I don't care what the manufacture says if you want you cookware to last don't put it in the dishwasher. With the non-stick coating it takes little effort to clean these so it's not worth it. Also, don't use metal instruments and never use cooking spray. Buy silicon utensils and a oil mister. The utensils are cheap and a mister lasts forever and is less expensive than 2 cans of Pam.Real world cooking experience. After spending a week with each I gave the Calphalon to my son who recently moved out. They are nice pans and should take most of his abuse but they do not compare with the Kitchen Aid set. Cooking is quicker, food cooks more evenly and they look great. The deep black finish and flat tops are a stark change from the grey, domed cookware you usually see. I did find that the handles of the Calphalon set were slightly more comfortable. But that is subjective. Anyway who holds their pans for more than 10 seconds at a time?Neither sets handles became hot but, as expected, the handles on the lids of both became hot.Lastly, while I like the look of the flat lids on the Kitchen Aid set, they do have issues. Domed lids like those on the Cal. set allow the condensation to continually drain. The flat lids tend to collect the condensation so that when you remove them... water everywhere. You quickly learn to tilt them as you remove but it is something of which to be aware.Are they a professional set, no. But restaurants cook 300+ meals a day with people who don't care if the pans last to the next shift. So why pay triple the price? Well, the speed at which a 6mm or 7mm thick set gets to temp. is nice but that's the only difference.

Everything that was supposed to be in the box, was in it.Cooking with them was a great experience, it actually still is. These DO have a nonstick feature and they DO heat up well. You can feel the quality in the weight and they are most certainly stackable. If you are concerned about the functionality - you won\'t be.However, the unfortunate thing about these pans is that they will not look great after a few months. If you are like my mother, and you cook at home every day, you will be privy to dark food marks from meats, grease stains and a potential rusty-look EVEN after washing and drying. You could, probably, remedy this with a pan cleaner product. Your permanent problem will more or less be the scratches that these EASILY get. You can try to prevent that by NEVER using metal utensils on them, and stacking them very carefully.In conclusion, I love that these work. That\'s what I had ultimately intended for my mother. She seems satisfied with the fact that they work. But I can tell she is not super jazzed about how they look right now, especially when we are coming up on the holidays and we will be having guests over. It kind of upsets me that she would have had to seriously ""baby"" these pans to get them to keep their appearance.I would honestly not buy these pans again for this reason. Like my mother, I take pride in being able to visually show off my cooking skills to anyone watching.

You\'ll get relatively even cooking from these. Upon delivery, I was surprised how heavy the box was. Keep in mind, as of this review, these are on sale. These do have the quality of a 80 or 90 dollar set. They\'re a good buy.I\'ve found non stick interiors eventually scratch and peel. Even those that claim you can safely use metal utensils. This one has that slightly grainy interior. This grainy kind tends to hold up better than ones with mirror smooth interior surfaces. To keep the interior lasting as long as possible, the flame should be no higher than medium, no metal utensils used, and no dishwashing. It\'s best to get a grill pan, and electric fryer or wok for cooking with searingly high heat. High heat will eventually ruin the nonstick abililty of these type of pans. I will keep mine out of oven, too. I find they lose nonstick ability if used in oven frequently, but these are ""oven safe to 350 degrees"".The manufacturer suggest seasoning the pans prior to cooking. The instruction booklet tells how to. They also advise to avoid washing, before the pans are cooled to prevent warping. I\'ve had the warping experience. When that happens, the lids no longer fit.The glass lids, with their steam vents, fits perfectly into the pots and pans. The lid knobs are nice and tall. The handles are great quality, but are not riveted. They are screwed on and will eventually need tightening. Upon purchasing, the handles are nice and tight with good quality screws attaching them.The saute and fry pans are open....no lids. It would have been nice if manufaturer included lid on skillet. The smallest saucepan is quite small. It\'s a good size for melting butter, boiling water for a couple cups of tea/instant coffee, or cooking frozen veggies for one or two people. The steam basket is included and expands to fit into the largest pot. It does have sharp feet and will potentially scratch pot\'s interior. Still, I\'m glad to have it. I can use it for steaming tamales in my stainless stock pot. While these don\'t have the pretty colors of an hardcoat enamel exterior, I like the nontick outside. It makes spillover cleanups easier. The exterior is a charcoal gray. It\'s slightly lighter than interior. In the photo, the detail work seen on the lid knobs is just the T-Fal logo.This is a good starter set for a single, and small family, too. In addition to these, you may need a dutch oven, a fryer or wok, a stovetop grill pan, and 3 or 4 pieces of various sizes in glass bakewear(recommend ""Marinex"" not Pyrex). You may purchase a generic lid for the fry pan. This will set you up really well in cooking for yourself/family and company.These were shipped with very good protective packaging. Extra care was given to the glass lids. Overall, I am very pleased with this set and definitely recommend for the average everyday cook, like myself. I will update a few months from now, and let you know how the interior is holding up. I intend to take extra care with these...tired of shelling out cash for nonstick cookware. This is the least expensive set I\'ve purchased and I think I will like it the most.UPDATE: I\'ve used the cookware regularly for almost a year and couldn\'t be more pleased with it\'s perfomance and durabililty. No scratches in the interior, no burn marks on the exterior, no flaking, peeling or warping. It cooks evenly.

As it\'s being used, my intention is to come back to this review with updates.I ordered this set after doing a bit of \'googling\' on what is the best cookware set for 2019 - I wanted something for our gas range. I think it\'s something to take into consideration when choosing what you\'re going to buy. An example - on a gas range - if the setting is high and your cookware has some sort of enamel-like finish, and the flames are coming over the sides of the pot/pan - it\'s going to discolor the finish after a period of time.I looked at the top 10 bracket, the top 5 bracket, I went to reviews, Good Housekeeping, Consumer Reports, just to name two of several, and surprisingly (at least for me) T-Fal was a set that kept popping up as one of the best. I\'ve always thought of T-Fal as one of those starter cookware sets that someone might purchase when they\'re moving into their first apartment and starting out on their own - it is/was inexpensive - a set for a person learning to cook and therefore not requiring something more \'higher-end.\' If you have/had those thoughts as well, you might want to set them aside, at least with this set..Upon pulling everything out of the box my first impression was they look really nice. The set is light weight - the handles are riveted, silicone encased and can withstand up to 400 degree oven temperature. The lids are heavy tempered glass, each one having a small vent hole, and the handles are also silicone encased as well. The design of the lid-handles seems to take into account the use of pot holders since there\'s substantial space between the glass and the handle itself. All of the lids in my set fit nicely onto their respective pot/pan - no warpage or bent rims. The pots/pans are dishwasher safe (mine aren\'t going to see the inside of a dishwasher), and this particular set you can use metal utensils (I personally ain\'t-a-gonna do it). It comes with a steamer that is designed to stack on top of the large pot (not the dutch oven). When you\'re done steaming, grab some pot holders and lift the insert out by it\'s handles - no muss, no fuss. It\'s a much better option than the collapsible steamer I currently using.It comes with instructions on how to care for your cookware. READ THE INSTRUCTIONS! Why you may ask? This set is replacing a Calphalon set, and yes Calphalon was/is rated highly as well. But why replace it? Because being the knuckle head that I am, I didn\'t read the instructions. I knew Calphalon had to be hand washed (at least the set that I own) - but what I didn\'t know was what high heat does to the pots. When you read the instructions for T-Fal, and because it\'s aluminum, it\'ll say something to the effect of using low to medium heat (because aluminum conducts heat really well). See … I didn\'t know that about anodized aluminum and what I ended up doing was burning the finish off of each pot and skillet bottom of my Calphalon set - right down to the bare aluminum and of course this affected the non-stick surface on the inside. So please, read and follow the instructions. One other thing before I wrap this up. When I was doing my \'research\' I came across this one video of an owner showing how an empty T-Fal pot didn\'t sit level on her stove. Seems the handle was heavy enough that it caused the pot to tip. She said this was a problem - and I guess it could be if you\'re in the process of putting something inside the pot in preparation of cooking. I do get that - but I placed an empty pot on the stove, centered over the burner, and it sat just fine - although I\'ll say my stove grate is different than the stove in the video - it also sat level on the counter top. Perhaps this might be something to take into consideration???So initial impression is the set seems to be of good quality, looks nice, and I\'m looking forward to putting this set through it\'s paces.UPDATE:As of December 4, 2019 I have to say that the T-Fal set has held up extremely well - cooking with this set is a breeze. I keep the burner setting usually at med-high if I want to bring something to a boil - and it doesn\'t take long for that to happen. The pots and pans conduct heat really well and there\'s practically no sticking. Usually I can pretty-much rinse off any food residue left behind using just running hot water. I\'m pretty good at using either wooden or silicon-type utensils when cooking, though on occasion I\'ve used metal spoons to stir, and there are no marks inside any of the pots/pans. I\'m not one of those cooks adept enough to shift a pan around and flip the contents briefly into the air (my cool-factor is not that high) so ""skating"" the bottom of a pot/pan over the cast-iron grate has not taken place, so I can\'t say what would happen to this set if I were to do so. If I were to hazard a guess, I would say that more than likely there would be some marring of the bottom since cast iron probably trumps aluminum. Overall I\'m very please with this purchase and the performance of this cook set.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 16, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Best Pans Ever!', 'author': 'Amazon Customer', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I love T-Fal Pans.

I always hand wash and never with anything abrasive.First thing is first there are a lot of mixed reviews about this set. As I've used these for over a year now and cook every meal every day with them I feel I can offer some insight. For me this has been the most I've ever spent on a set of pots and pans not going to lie I bought these because of the color and they were a little darker than what I expected but as I love the color Navy I wasn't too upset about it. I have treated these pots and pans as investments and such they are still in really good conditon.Cleaning care that I've done to make them last over a year:First off I never put any of them in the dishwasher as the dishwasher water can possibly get too hot and cause bubbling in coatings, even though it's dishwasher safe I have always been told when it comes to pots and pans that you like and plan on keeping hand wash only. I've also never used an abrasive sponge on them as I know that it can lead to scratching any time there is a coating on a pot or pan if you don't mind risking taking off the coating then go ahead and use the abrasive side of a scotch Brite or other abrasive sponge. As I spent a good chunk of money knowing I wasn't going to be buying another set for a while I am personally not comfortable with it. A general rule of thumb I have when something says coating, don't use anything abrasive on it. If you really can't resist scrubbing I suggest a silicone scrubber they work great! Otherwise you can let it sit in hot water to help loosen the baked on or cooked on stuff or put water in it and reheat it and scrub with a wooden or silicone cooking utensil. The sheet pan did discolor and turn brown which is something I'm okay with and expected as I cook all the time using it.I had the sauce pot warp while cleaning (dropped it while cleaning or dropped something on it right after I got it) it wasn't bad however the lid no longer fit correctly. I was able to fix it with my bare hands however after filling it with hot water and letting it sit for a bit. The nonstick coating has never come off for me, and the non stick coating still works like new I do put oil in these mainly for flavor but also it does help keep the nonstick coating still good, and I'm still able to get a good sear on meat and everything, and my husband has loved how much I cook with them, and has also loved cooking with them. Overall I've had a very good experience and as someone who cooks 3-5 meals a day, I get a ton of use and still work like new over a year later, with the extra steps I've taken caring for them. I think these will probably last me for a while until I save enough money to buy a set that will probably end up being passed to my children.I only gave four stars, as the fact that I could fix these without any tools was a bit concerning and also the fact I do take the extra steps to care for these means that I hand wash dishes every day can be annoying."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 9, 2022', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Easy to clean, handle and great color!!', 'author': 'Paul King', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'These are great!

This surface was really odd and it was so bad that part of me thinks it was possible defective and perhaps the non-stick coating wasn\'t even applied. Even after scrubbing and putting through the dishwasher twice we found normal foods would not come off. We ended up returning it.Additionally, why would you put metal handles on these? Yes, they do look aesthetically better, but in the kitchen ""form should follow function"" and that isn\'t what you have here. The handles obviously get hot very easily.

There is no way I could be any happier with a stainless steel set of cookware! The product is hefty without being heavyweight, balanced in hand, heats very quickly, uses less than half of heat setting to what I use on cast iron or all aluminum.1. Used the 2 quart pan and steamer to do green beans. Brought the water to boil on 6, (you could do this on 4 if you give it another minute or so) added beans, reduced heat to 1 for 20 minutes...perfect! Clean up...there was a little cloudiness in the steamer, used vingar and it cleared right up, the pot had the slight water mark, I used vingar but it did not clear up, used Cerama Bryte (my stovetop cleaner) and it removed it wonderfully.2. Used the 10 in fry pan to sautee onions. I used 3 T of olive oil and let heat on #4 for couple of minutes until I could see the oil movement, added onions. Reduced heat to 3 to cook. There was residue stuck to pan but instant removal with soap and water! No cloudness in pan.3.In 1 1/2 quart pan boiled potatotes. Cooked on 1 again after using 4 to bring to boil.The usual ring around the pan and cloudness in pan. Washed with soap and water then used Cerama Bryte to remove water ring and haze. Barkeepers or vingar both left some ring residue. The Cerama Bryte will remove....you can see the sliver haze on the paper towel when you use the CB. CB works great on the ceramic stovetop when foam won't remove as long as the spot is not deep burned, then I have to use Barkeeper's Friend and it does the job!4. Used the small fry pan to scramble eggs. Used 2T corn oil on #4 when oil started to bubble poured in eggs, turned down heat to 3 and scrambled. Geeze I had to look to see if it was coated with telflon!! They did not stick and slide right out of the pan. I am using a new GE ceramic top stove to do this, so some burners on other models could not be as hot and need to be set on 4 or whatever to do actual cooking. Main thing is HEAT THE PAN before you put the food in to cook. Do not over heat either or it will grab spots and stick. I did read not to heat to hot or pan could warp. Also do not heat pan very long while empty.5.Used the deep fry pan to cook smothered steak...yum!! Again brought heat up to #6 with 1/4 cup of oil. Rolled steak in flour and seasoned, placed in pan and reduced heat to 3 or 4 and browned side well then flipped over using silicone spatula and did same to other side, be sure it's well browned before trying to flip or coating will stick to pan, now add 2 cups or more of water and let simmer with lid on at lowest setting (just so there is a slight boil) and cook for an hour or until tender. Add more water as needed and thicken if desired with flour in water, then add to pan. Pour over hot Pillsbury biscuits (frozen kind) and chow down. Clean up was a breeze again. Soap and water and for some reason no cloudness.....maybe because the heat was turned down low and stayed low!? Do not use metal utensils unless you don't mind scratches. Note: I do the All American Cooking so these have and will get a work out!!AND to think I HATED stainless steel all these years! I always cooked on a coil stove and everything stuck tight! I spent some time reading reviews on how ever one was cooking so knew what to do and it worked! Can only say buy these if you want a great set of cookware and a price that is great. All-Clad is just unreal on their prices (not knocking their product just if you have more money than you know what to do with buy) and the reviews are no better than for this set and this product is made the SAME as the high price All-Clad....and these are all clad (meaning they have the aluminum core on bottom and sides. Just be sure to check the weight of the set you are buying, that will let you know what quality you are getting. These are 21.7 lbs, with the shipping weight being 28.2 lbs. Weights on the box!

I spent a lot of time researching the different brands and their product lines and what to look for in cookware. I replaced a set of the all-aluminum Calphalon that were so ‘hot’ in the 90’s (pun intended) but were completely destroyed and, as a result, I barely used them. Then we renovated our kitchen and I found myself compelled to cook.I decided on stainless early (i.e. dishwasher safe, durable, cooktop-oven-table flexibility, no toxic coatings, etc.) and figured I would eventually pick up cast iron and non-stick pans for their more specific benefits. I also read that 18/10 stainless steel is the best. I am a ‘research first, then buy quality’ type and am willing to spend more for what I believe to be a more value-added product. The Cuisinart Chef’s Classic line was my baseline because it fit the above requirements and was a great price. Then I started researching in earnest.I discovered that an aluminum and/or copper core that went up the entire side of the pot/pan would be an improvement over one with the conductive metal in the bottom only, which is how the Chef’s Classic line is made. I felt that this was worth the additional cost (and I was right).My manufacturer search started with what many believe is the gold standard, All-Clad. It’s an excellent product but in the end I couldn’t justify spending the equivalent of a down payment on a car on a set of cookware. Calphalon was next and, although less expensive, they are still a lot of money. The Cuisinart multi-clad cookware line kept coming up as an alternative so I dove into researching the positives and negatives. I couldn’t find any other than that they are made in China so I dove in.In short this cookware is amazing and has me cooking things I never thought I would try otherwise. As with anything, there is a (very) small learning curve using this cookware. I have a gas cooktop and here is what I learned. You will find all of these ‘lessons learned’ in other reviews and although they may be academic to many, I had to learn them for myself.1. You will not have to use anything hotter than medium-low to medium unless you are boiling water. For that, medium-high is plenty hot. The pans are tremendous at heating evenly and retain heat in the entire pot/pan; cooking the food on all sides.2. When you boil water, don’t put salt the cold water. Wait until it boils. Salt will make pits in the surface (this set of pots escaped this mistake, but my old stainless steel pot from Ik*a suffered my ignorance)3. Use a pan that’s sized for the food you are cooking. It helps control how much oil you use, makes it easier to manipulate the food in the pan and it will cook the food faster. Bigger isn’t better.4. Warm the pan on your cooktop without anything in it for a few minutes then flick some water droplets in it. If they skate across the surface like mercury it’s ready for the oil/butter.5. Use just enough oil to coat the bottom and the sides an inch or so, so you can use them while you are cooking.6. The oil is ready for food when it starts to ‘ripple’. If it starts to ripple really fast and/or starts to smoke, turn down the heat. Less is definitely more here. At this point you have basically created a non-stick surface on the skillet’s almost semi-polished finish. Pork chops, fried eggs, etc. slide around without scalding and make cleanup a breeze. I would rather add an extra 120 calories to a dish that serves four using a tablespoon of olive oil than have flakes of Teflon in my food. 40 calories is not a savings in my book, and I have to watch what I eat. I also have no desire to treat cookware with kid gloves. I did that for 17 years with the Calphalon I replaced.7. These pans do not need to be ‘seasoned’ by baking them in the oven or on the cooktop with a high heat oil. Please, please, please know this is not necessary. I did it and found my brand new, sparkling pans covered in what only can be described as a coat of inpenetrable motor oil. Up the sides, on the handles, everywhere. I thought they were ruined. Which leads me to my research on cleanup.8. 95% of the time dishwashing liquid and water when the pan is still a bit warm will clean it right up. Sometimes just a little warm water does the trick and the small bit of oil left on the pan makes it a little more non-stick for the next time. Cameo stainless steel cleaner and Bar Keeper’s Friend are amazing for thick layers of tough burned on food. They also remove scorch marks on the bottom from the burners being too hot. Serious scrubbing with these made my brand new pans look new again. Amazingly, no surfaces were harmed during that workout.9. Rainbow hues and water scales (we have scaly water in Chicago) disappear with some distilled vinegar. I hear club soda does the trick too, but I use that for cocktails.Finally, I did supplement this set with the 5 ½ qt. casserole (MCP55-30N) as I needed a larger pan. I read a review here that the casserole and saute pans are the same except the saute pan has a handle as opposed to two grips. She was right and it does make it easier to use, cleanup and store. I also won’t bother buying non-stick and cast iron pans, since I’ve mastered using this cookware. This cookware has made me a much better cook and made the whole cooking process easier.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States April 24, 2015', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Very impressed', 'author': 'OC Doc', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Bought this set to replace a thirteen year-old set of Cuisinart Everyday Stainless, which I passed down to an employee who is just starting a household and who had no kitchen furnishings whatsoever. The 2001 version of Everyday Stainless was steel with a mirror finish, and a very thin steel/copper/steel disk attached at the bottom---nothing as sturdy as today\'s Chef\'s Choice line with its very thick, encapsulated aluminum/steel disks. That said, they held up very well, the exterior mirror finishes were still stunning, and the interiors still spot free---thanks to Barkeepers Friend. The only major negative were the rolled, hollow handles which got hot during cooking and which often required the use of mitts to handle the pan.Given that I was upgrading, I was willing to spend in the area of $250-300 and was hoping for clad cookware. All-Clad at $700-900 for a full set was out of the question. I did consider the 10 piece French Tri-ply set, which is made in France, which was priced about $50 more than MultiClad Pro. However, that set had only one saucepan and yet two frying pans---since I use saucepans more frequently than frying pans, I\'d prefer more saucepans and fewer frying pans. There is a larger French Tri-ply set, with extra saucepans and a pasta insert for the stockpot, but it was priced up in the low $400s.In addition, there was the issue of the exterior finish. French Tri-Ply (and also Chef\'s Choice) has a mirror finish, whereas MultiClad Pro has a brushed finish. My existing pans (Everyday Stainless, 2001 version) had a mirror finish which, while attractive, took extra time to maintain because they would ""show"" hard water spots. One couldn\'t set them on a dish drainer to dry, the exterior had to be hand dried right away to avoid spots. In addition, some of them had been dropped on to a ceramic tile floor, which caused dents and scratches. Since MultiClad Pro offered the brushed exterior, which I figured would not ""show"" water spots, and since the construction of the two sets was virtually identical otherwise, I went with MultiClad Pro. In addition, the larger French Tri-Ply set was $150 more than this set, and the smaller French Tri-Ply set, while only $50 more, would have required me to buy additional saucepans, thereby increasing the cost of building a set comparable in scope to the 12 piece MultiClad Pro set.Heat conductivity is wonderful, noticeably better than the old pans, and also better than the few Chef\'s Choice pieces (sauteé pan, wok) that I bought several years ago to augment the original stainless steel set. I\'m already a pro at cooking on stainless, just start out low heat and gradually increase it, and don\'t forget Pam or olive oil spray or other nonstick product to reduce sticking. The pans clean up beautifully, and emerge spotless from the dishwasher. I now realize I enjoy the brushed finish more than a mirror finish, since I no longer have to fuss about removing all water spots from a mirror exterior. The brushed interior is also easier to maintain than a shiny interior.This is of course a matter of taste. Some folks who hang their cookware from a rack in the kitchen might perhaps want a showier look with a mirror finish, but I stow mine in a base cabinet and don\'t need to ""show"" a shiny finish. I\'m more concerned with cooking performance and ease of clean up. For those who want a shiny finish, perhaps invest in the French Tri-Ply line, but I\'m delighted with this set and am sure it will be my ""last"" set. Bonus: there are many additional pieces in the line if you wish to augment your collection. I already have the Chef\'s choice 5 qt sauteé and wok, and see no reason to replace them, but someone without such pieces can choose from a lot of additional pieces to build one\'s collection. They also offer a ""casserole"", which is basically the sauteé pan with two helper handles and no long handle. This is perfect for dishes which you start on the stove top but finish in the oven: the lack of the long handle helps you fit it in the oven, and otherwise the pan is the same as a sauteé.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States June 29, 2013', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Quality set!', 'author': 'Johnston', 'rating': 4, 'content': ""I've been looking for a stainless steel set for awhile now, and was hestitant to buy anything not non-stick. I am health-minded so I've been trying to use 'healthy' ceramic-coated, porcelain-coated cast iron, etc., but everything has left me dissapointed. 'Healthy' versions of non-stick lose their non-stick after awhile, and for me cast iron is too heavy and hard to clean. I originally didn't want stainless steel because I love the convenience/easy clean up of non-stick. BUT I was tired of non-stick pans losing their coating and looking ugly after awhile. Still, my favorite skillets to cook with are porcelain-coated cast iron (Le Creuset or Cusinart), but they are so expensive and almost impossible to find a full set of pots and pans.All this to say, I am very impressed by this Cuisinart Multiclad set. I've been using them daily for over a week now, and have got a good feel for how they perform and clean up (I'm an avid cook, and make breakfast and dinner at home almost every day). I only use silicone/plastic utensils so I don't scratch them (scratches aren't terribly noticable anyway, but I want these to last). I make sure to keep them on medium or low heat only, and so far they maintain heat enough that I don't need it on high. They cook well, evenly and quickly. Things do stick (like eggs and anything starchy like potatoes), but clean up has been a breeze!! I add water to the pans/pots after cooking and leave them on the stove. Easy. By the time they're cooled and ready to be cleaned, I can easily scrub off stuck-on food from the bottom of the pans with minimal effort. I use a pampered chef hard nylon scrapper to gently scrape bits off the bottom, and then a non-abrasive sponge (rough side, and then regular side) to clean. They clean up like brand new! (Minus the water spots, lol). (I used a steel wool scrubber on one of the pans and it left tiny scratches throughout-not too noticable, but :-| ) I've use bar-keepers friend once since I've got them a week ago because there was slight discoloration (normal for stainless steel) on the bottom of a couple of the pans. It took the discoloration away and they look brand new. I wouldn't use bar-keepers friend with every washing because I'm sure it's somewhat harsh on the pans and the chemicals are terrible for you. But if you want to keep your pans looking brand new, it's a must have! There was nothing I could have done to keep my non-stick pans looking brand new once they lost their coating. The thing I love about SS is there is no unhealthy coating to worry about flaking off in food! I cook with ghee, butter and avocado oil spray and while things do still stick after cooking for awhile (not right away if you're using an oil), clean up is easy enough that it doesn't bother me enough to go back to non-stick. I am sticking with these pans! Lids are also great, and there's a lid that fits for every pan (multiple pans use the same lid size). This is a great price for a set that is comparable to an All-Clad.

If they\'re taken care of, they\'ll last you a lifetime. I grew up admiring Martha Stewart and Julia Child. I enjoy watching Ina Garten (Barefoot Contessa.) My favorite dishes to make are chicken and mango fajitas with orange and lime, my Aunt\'s lasagna recipe with beef and Italian sausage and four cheeses. I\'ve been known to make gyros from scratch, baklava for holidays.I contemplated copper cookware, but I couldn\'t afford the Mauviel copper sets made in France. I have always loved 18/10 stainless. 18/0 hasn\'t much weight to it. I didn\'t want hard anodized cookware, or porcelain ceramic. I didn\'t want something inexpensive. Lagostina seemed it might be a great second choice. I went to Bed, Bath & Beyond simply to look at the Lagostina. For $2K, Mauviel copper cookware has a base of 2.5 mm thick. For $399.00, Lagsotina\'s copper set is 2.3 mm thick. I also examined the Lagostina stainless steel for $199.00 on sale. The lids seemed to wobble on the cookware. An annoyance I couldn\'t live with. Copper is a fabulous conductor of heat and it\'s beautiful. However, it cannot be placed in the dishwasher, it discolors with a bluish green patina, and must be polished with Wright\'s copper cream or Bar Keepers Friend, or a fresh lemon and salt to restore original color. Too much upkeep for me for everyday use.I felt stainless steel is the way to go. Non stick is only nice if you don\'t cook with E.V. olive oil, or any fats. Through researching, Martha Stewart said,; \'ALL CLAD; is the greatest cookware on the planet, and it\'s American made.\' if that\'s important to you. I looked at All Clad at Bed Bath& Beyond. Oh, it was lovely! The heaviest cookware. I picked up some Cuisinart MCP and held it in my hand. I was seriously impressed. I researched the weight of each of the pieces, because that matters. If you want cheap, go to Walmart. I\'m not trying to knock Walmart. Martha Stewart said, ""Buy what you can afford."" Amazon Prime had this priced normally at $670.00 suggested retail. This entire set of Cuisinart Multi Clad Pro, 12 piece stainless steel cookware for $205.00 without sales tax. I was SOLD. It arrived in early 2018, I was thrilled! USPS delivered it to my doorstep. I couldn\'t even pick up the box as it\'s very heavy. I scooted it across the foyer, through the living room, right into my kitchen and parked it in front of my stove. I\'m in love. This stuff is AMAZING!! Here\'s another thing that sold me quickly. I believe this is oven proof to 500 or 550 degrees. It pours nicely directly from the pieces themselves. Brilliantly designed. Remember, after FOUR years, mine still looks like the day it arrived. Bar Keepers Friend powdered cleanser/polish is your best friend. (Wear gloves.)For the weirdos who don\'t know how to cook, if it sticks, you\'re doing it wrong. I had my 10"" MCP pan on medium to cook pancakes this morning, and even on medium, it was a tad too hot for pancakes. This MCP conducts heat beautifully. I\'m not using metal scouring pads on this cookware. I want it to stay beautiful. I have a green nylon scouring pad, and a stiff dishwashing brush. I want my cookware to look beautiful always, and it\'s dishwasher safe. I am looking forward to using the steamer insert to steam fresh veggies!

I figured I would order this, decide which one I liked more and give one to my sone who is moving out for the first time. The Calphalon was hard used nad coupld have been taken care of better but teaching three kids (and my wife) to cook put it to it's test, so was showing it's age and I was looking for something 'prettier' for when we had people over.Out of the box:- Everythign was packaged well (both original packaging and the Amazon packaging).- The individual pieces were heavy (which I was worried they would seem flimsy, totally not the case). Welds are sturdy for handles and finish was perfect.- Ever single piece seemed to be one size smaller that what I had with my old set. The sizes should be fine for an average family but if you often cook for 10 or more, plan on ordering some of the larger pieces.- The stickers on the lids were annoying to remove but not a big deal.Cooking:- Eveything works great with my ceramic cookrange. Heating is even. It does seem to retain heat better than my old set and if you're going to turn it down right before something boils over you're going to be a few minutes too late ;-)- I do use my cast iron for searing meat and cooking eggs, so I can't comment on how it browns.meat.- I have not gone from range to oven with these yet but don't see it being an issue.- Handles remain cool which is great.Cleaning- No issues so far with cleaning them and them looking like new! I am on a well with a lot of minerals so water spots keep me busy. I have not run them through the dishwasher and probably never will.Overall:- My son is enjoying the old Calphalon set in his apartment! I think my wife really likes these too but just wont admit it. You may need to buy a few larger pieces depending on your cooking style (12 Qt stockpot was a must have, it's wider and taller than the 8Qt that comes with this set). I have a few other pieces on my wish list that I'll be ordering over the next couple of months, but I must admit I'm surprised that a set that cost half as much as the Calphalon set performs as well as this does! Stainless is a change, but it hasn't been a bad one for me,This is a great set and I'm glad I gave it a shot."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 1, 2017', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Good warranty support', 'author': 'Amazon Customer', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'First, I like that the pot lids fit the two frying pans perfectly. After a few uses, I noticed that one frying pan\'s handle was subtly askew, like a broken nose. After noticing that, I couldn\'t stop focusing on that manufacturing imperfection. I called their customer support and she immediately asked for my address and had a replacement on its way. She stated that they have a lifetime warranty. That won me over, as now I\'m confident that if they warp due to no fault of my own, I\'ll be covered. (I read a well known online review group that said the pans had a tendency to warp, but Cuisinart\'s warranty service has put me at ease assuming I don\'t do anything stupid, such as dumping a hot pan into a sink of water. )The pans seems to cook just fine and I am happy with their performance. My stainless steel experience is minimal as most of my previous cooking experience has been with cast iron and carbon steel. The tri-ply does spread that heat out much better and more quickly than CI or CS, but SS requires more oil than a well seasoned CI or CS. Either way, all three types clean up well.As far as style, they are polished on the inside and the last centimeter on the upper outer edge. The bottom and most of the sides are brushed. The lids are polished. At least when they are brand new, the mirror like reflection the Cuisinart insides is very attractive. They are very pretty and I almost didn\'t want to risk spoiling the pretty pans by actually cooking in them. With baking soda, vinegar, some elbow grease, and towel drying, I\'m able to keep the pans shiny and nice looking. I have a 12 inch frying pan from the Brazilian brand and that\'s brushed on the inside and polished on the outside and brushed on the outside bottom. Neither style is better, just different. Compared to the Brazilian pan, the Cuisinart seems to be a bit heavier in construction, but hard to definitely say since I\'m comparing a 12"" of the other company to smaller frying pans from Cuisinart. I have no real preference between one company\'s rounded handles vs. Cuisinart\'s flatter style. Overall, I think the pans are a great value, especially when bought during the November discount season. I don\'t think my cooking would be any better with one of the more expensive brands and I\'m not going to freak out as these pans gather the inevitable scratches over the years or get abused by my kids. Sometimes there\'s good mental value to owning something functional, but not fashionable so I won\'t be inclined to be worried over it like I (imagine) I\'d be with a new luxury car. I wish the Cuisinart were not made in China, but at least Cuisinart is American owned, unlike Al...ad which is now owned by a French conglomerate. Still, I\'d prefer something not made in a country that we at political odds with, so the made in Brazil pans are attractive in that sense.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 15, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Absolutely love this set!', 'author': 'Carl', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I decided to wait for a while to write this review as I wanted to use them for at least a few weeks prior to rating and reviewing. Keep in mind this is my first set of stainless steel cookware I\'ve ever used so I can\'t really compare them to other stainless steel sets. I\'ve only used numerous types/styles of non-stick sets. Teflon, ceramic, ""green pan"", copper chef, etc. (I\'ve never actually BOUGHT a set of cookware until I bought these, all of the others have been gifts of some sort).I was trying to decide between these or a set that Calphalon were heavily discounting at the time (a set with copper on the outside, stainless on the inside, aluminum core), but out of all the comparisons and other reviews, I chose these instead mainly because the copper would most likely tarnish and get unevenly ugly. Also America\'s Test Kitchen tested sauce pans. The winner being All-clad of course was WELL out of my price range. Their next recommendation though was the Cuisinart Multiclad unlimited, and I figured those should perform similar to these.ProsStainless steel - with care will last a lifetime and moreHeats very evenly and quicklyThe tapered rim really does make pouring MUCH easier and practically drip free (I always have a paper towel handy regardless)Cooked eggs without sticking (yeah, you read that right)Cooking is much more predictableConsThe cookware do ""stain"" but can be removedMust be very diligent with proper preheating and not overheatingParts of the cookware is a high mirror polish (more on why I put this as a con later)Could be sensitive to temperature shock (but then again, MOST if not all cookware is)First, I\'ll tackle the cons""Stains"" can occur on the cooking surface, especially if you get some stuck food (some food sticking is normal, it\'s called fond, don\'t be discouraged by it). After giving it a good soap and water bath with a plastic scrub sponge I\'ve noticed light colored ""whitish"" marks on the cookware. Honestly this isn\'t a problem, but it does trigger my OCD to want the pans to look clean. Nothing a little Bon Ami/Bar Keepers Friend can\'t fix. Just don\'t really recommend doing this often as these are minor abrasives. This leads me to...Mirror like finish in spots. I honestly wish all of the surface had the brushed look to it. Once you use Bon Ami/Bar Keepers friend on the upper parts of the cooking surface or elsewhere, you\'ll get swirl marks. This is just once again my OCD of wanting to keep my brand new set looking brand new. They WILL scratch and get swirls and other stuff. But the mirror finish only makes it that much worse. It obviously won\'t change the performance of the cookware.Preheating/overheating. These pans can heat up QUICK (ymmv depending on your stove type, mine is electric with exposed element), even on medium. Because of this you really need to make sure you aren\'t overheating the pan while preheating. Overheat can/will lead to badly stuck/burned food. This is going to be typical of pretty much any multiclad/all clad stainless steel cookware. If you don\'t like this, stick with hard anodized or something of the sort.Temperature shock. Honestly this should go without saying, but really the last thing you want to do is go from cooking to putting this under cold water. I\'ve seen reviews (from pros using this specific cookware) where they have done this and the pan was fine. But really, you seriously run the risk of warping ANY cookware doing this. Just.....don\'t do it.Time for the prosStainless steel - Really, there\'s not much to say here. Because the outer and inner surfaces are stainless steel, as long as you\'re not abusing the pans, they\'ll last forever. There isn\'t a non-stick surface that slowly turns turns into a reason for throwing it out.Heats evenly/quickly - The fact that these have an aluminum core sandwiched by stainless steel really helps these pans heat up quick and even. I\'ve made frittata and numerous other things and get a pretty consistent cook throughout the entire thing (it would help if my stove top were more level but there\'s little I can do about that without replacing the entire top, the whole stove is level).Tapered rim - I\'ve poured out sauces, soups bacon grease, etc. It all pours out really easy and smooth. I can\'t 100% comment on it being drip free as I always have a paper towel or something handy to wipe the edge. Force of habit.Cooked eggs without sticking - Yeah I\'ve read numerous reviews saying that eggs stick like crazy to these. It\'s the one thing that made me wait 2 weeks prior to even think about cooking eggs, let alone over easy eggs on these. I can safely say that eggs swirl around on these pans just as good as any perfectly new non-stick pan. Granted you need to make sure you heat the pan just right and prep it. I haven\'t tried putting eggs in with JUST butter yet but I would imagine it would work. Usually I\'ll put a about an 1/8th of a teaspoon of canola oil in the pre heated pan and use a paper towel to cover the surface and the sides, let it sit for a few seconds, then put a little butter in the bottom. I have yet to have any eggs stick at all. In fact, I threw out my old 8"" non-stick I kept around specifically for eggs.Cooking predictable - Because the pans heat evenly and they\'re super conductive, cooking because so much more predictable and you use much less heat. On my old pans, I\'d usually cook most things on medium high. I\'ve found medium with these has been equivalent. Polenta, rice, etc all cook really nicely because you can just set the heat to low and just let it go. At first I was a bit worried about the lids not being see through (as I\'ve always had glass lids) but now I\'ve come to not care.All in all every single time I cook with this cookware, I always find myself saying ""I Love these pans!!!"". I have yet to have food ""stick"" to them. At least to the point where it\'s destroying the food. The only thing I haven\'t tried are fish and pancakes, but I would imagine pancakes would stick regardless. If you\'re having a problem with all your food sticking, you\'re doing it wrong. You\'re most likely over heating the pan. Watch some youtube vids about proper use of stainless steel cookware and you should be able to figure it out.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 17, 2017', 'is_verified': True}]"

I wish a Deep Dutch oven pot came with this also with removable handles. This is a brilliant idea for storage.I also wondered why there wasn’t a handle for each pot… comes with a set of five pots, two handles, and three lids $100 (worth every cent) but it makes sense because you’re typically not using all of them at the same time. And even if you were using four of the five pots, at the same time, you can take the handles off while it’s cooking and then put it on until you need to move them… That is fabulous!

I was just cooking 2 eggs, so there wasn’t anything heavy in the pan to weigh down. When I attached the handle, it pulled the pan down due to the weight of it and caused the pan to lift off the burner on one side. It would probably be fine if you were cooking something heavier like a sauce or steak, but otherwise the handle is just too heavy to use while cooking with the smaller pan.Original review: I am really impressed with this set so far. It includes 5 pots/pans and 3 lids. Two pairs of pans have the same diameter so even with only 3 lids, each one has a lid to match. The lids have a nice silicone border which prevents the lid from scratching the pan, unlike similar lids with metal rims. The handles to the lids were simple to install. As for the handles for the pans, I find them to be the best part of this set. They are incredibly easy to attach and remove. This allows all the pots/pans to stack neatly for storage. You can also use the pots for serving dishes if you want, since the handles can be removed and stored away. The nonstick coating on these is really nice and I’m hopeful that it will hold up well.

Love these pans!', 'author': 'Lisa', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I received a Gotham fry pan for Christmas and loved it so much, I asked for the whole set for my birthday! They are fantastic! The first time I used it to fry an egg along with some egg whites, No butter, No oil, NO STICKING whatsoever! The egg and whites slid right out with ease. I\'ve also used them for quesadillas where cheese has melted out of the tortilla into the pan, but again NO STICKING! LOVE THAT! With my nonstick pan, I would still have to scrape melted cheese off of it even using butter or oil, but these just wipe clean. Even if something does stick a bit, a smidge of butter or oil will release it quickly, versus using 3 times as much fat as with stainless or non-stick pans. I dislike non-stick pans as the coating can be harmful and you MUST ALWAYS use some type of fat when heating them up (so as not to have chemicals released into the air). Not to mention, the coating inevitably starts to degrade (peeling, cracking, etc.) then you must toss them (even the expensive non-stick such as Calphalon). My non-stick pans went into the garbage after getting this set! (they were falling apart anyway)I\'ve been trying to watch the amount of fat in my diet, so being able to cook without butter or oil is a plus for sure. Now to sweat veggies for making sauces (onions and garlic primarily) I do use a little fat to get the ""party"" started, as the veg will just burn if you don\'t use a little fat for them to swim around in and soften vs carmelizing. To those reviewers that gave bad reviews for the handles getting hot, well that\'s going to happen with any metal handle. I have an Emerilware fry pan and the handle gets hotter than these. I like the metal handles as I can pop the pan in the oven without worry of plastic melting. The instructions say they are dishwasher safe, but I\'m not sure if I\'ll do that as the dishwasher has a way of ruining pans, but cleaning these is such a breeze, I just do it by hand. I\'m not sure about the manufacturer\'s warranty as I have not had to use it or the other reviews that state their food has stuck to the pan, I have not had that issue. The one thing I did notice in the instructions is to NEVER use non-stick spray, so perhaps other reviewers that had a sticking problem, used non-stick spray?You do have to watch the temperature when cooking in these as they do heat up hotter than traditional stainless or non-stick cookware. I used the fry pan to make cornbread in my oven (instead of my cast iron) and it did a great job with no butter or oil! The crust stuck a little to the bottom, but wiped out with ease. The cornbread was done in about 15 minutes versus 25 as with my cast iron, so again you do have to watch the heat and the food, it\'s not a ""set it and forget it"" type cookware. I highly recommend these pans if you\'re tired of non-stick teflon coated kind.

A family member of mine has ceramic pots and pans and I detested them: every time I tried to use them I needed to use so much more oil than I ever would prefer, and things often usually stuck anyway and were very hard to clean off. But I read that ceramic pots and pans just require different care and cooking methods, e.g. cooking on lower temperatures and not using scratchy cleaning materials. And for the price point of around $100 for a fairly complete set, I decided to go for it.So far, I adore these pots and pans!My fiancé and I have been using them daily for the past week and so far the nonstick factor is working just the way its advertised. I'm finding that they heat up faster and keep the heat better than cookware I'm more accustomed to, and I never have to turn the heat up past med-high. Usually medium works just fine. I haven't used *any* oil or butter in my cooking so far with no issues whatsoever.One issue is that one of the handles came pretty badly scratched, as you can see in the attached photo (sorry for the poor photo quality). And the largest skillet isn't quite as large as I would want, though I'm able to cook a standard sized tofu scramble pretty easily as long as I'm careful (one block of tofu, peppers, onions). And the handles do indeed get very warm, sometimes too hot to touch, but I bought a pair of silicone oven (+ multipurpose) mitts for that purpose and now it's a non-issue. Otherwise these are excellent. I love the way they look and they cook wonderfully. I'm very, *very* happy we made the purchase!PROS:+ Heats quickly, retains heat better (no need for higher than a little over medium heat)+ Nonstick factor is better than traditional nonstick (imo) both in effect and health+ Cleanup is a breeze+ Heavy duty but lightweight+ BeautifulCONS:- Largest skillet isn't as big as I'd like (can't use for multi-ingredient stirfries, for instance) and I'm not sure I'll use the smallest skillet as it's so small- Medium pot doesn't have a lid- Handles do get hot (just use holders)- Learning curve (but I picked adjusted to the new temperature requirements and cleaning style very quickly)OVERALL:5★ Very pleased with purchase, especially at a $100 price point. These are the best pots and pans I've ever worked with. If you're willing to learn something new, give these a shot. As long as you do what you're supposed to (don't overheat them, don't use nonstick sprays, don't scrub with anything abrasive, don't poke around with anything but gentle utencils) ceramic is amazing and you'll fall in love.I'll try to remember to come back to update after several months' use, and if there are any issues I'll update for sure."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 28, 2018', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Good heat surface but handles on pan and cover get hot', 'author': 'Joyce Harris', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'These are good non-stick pans that are very easy to use and clean.

The results: FIRST: Wash and then season each pan before using. Do not use cooking spray. I used butter on one and margarine on the others before using. SECOND: The first thing noticed is that it seems to take longer for the pan to reach cooking level. So what is the first reaction? TURN THE HEAT UP TO HIGH! WRONG WRONG WRONG.!!! Here is the test I did on my small pan...and please don\'t try this as your results may not be exactly the same. I seasoned the pan (9"") and then proceeded to cook my eggs on high. Once cooking temp was reached, cooking time was short. The eggs appeared to stick. Once the pan cooled, I rinsed the pan, and the placed it in THE DISHWASHER. Results? Pan came out looking brand new. Not satisfied with this one test, I did the same thing 6 days in a row more; high heat, cool, rinse, dishwasher. Pan came out looking brand new. The one more important condition noted: AFTER THIS ""ABUSE"" THE PAN STILL STAYED FLAT ON MY GLASS TOP RANGE. Is this important? Absolutely! I previously purchased the top brands of non-stick cookware. Both sets were somewhat heavy and my thinking was ""heavy is good"". Within 1 year both sets showed signs of warping and now, I could place any of the pans on the range and ""teter-totter"" these pans with the handle. So far, the Gotham set is still flat. I have an electric glass top range and First: I pre-heat my pan (except for boiling water or soup), on ""7"" and do not exceed that temp and then adjust downward to 4 or 5. Pre-heat time takes about 1-2 minutes. Second, cooking times will vary somewhat with this set. Ex: I boiled pasta in the large pot which would normally take 6-6 1/2 minutes. The pasta came out a bit more chewy and could have used another minute or so. Moral?: Cooking times might vary from what you are used to (if this is important). Now for the LIDS that came with the set. I was doing my EPA banned chili and had covered the pot to simmer. Later, I went back to stir the concoction, lifted the lid and promptly got my wrist slightly cooked with steam. I had forgotten about the HOLE in the lid. Now, this IS a good idea to prevent boil-overs but I would suggest placing the lid hole turned away from you while on the pot. STAINLESS STEEL STRAINER: Haven\'t tried it yet. Overall, the set SEEMS thin and flimsy but I don\'t find this to be a negative. Use pot holders when lifting pans by the handle (s). Same with the lids. Handles did not get super hot but exercise caution anyway. Everything I have cooked so far (with the experimental heat adjustments) has come out better than I thought. So, unless you are boiling water or really need to, your cooking temp should be no higher than 5 to 7 on your electric range. (Sorry, I don\'t have any feel for those with gas ranges). As for the reports of surface material chipping, etc. I don\'t know about you but I DO NOT USE AN ELECTRIC DRILL TO MIX THINGS IN MY COOKWARE! Unless the pan is totally diamond coated, any surface will wear with excessive abuse. And finally, to retain the cooking ability of this set, I take the pan/pot OFF THE DIRECT HEAT once cooking is done. OVERALL: This set has exceeded my expectations. I am using various items of this set twice per day and have only had the set about one month. Still, it is doing what is said it will do, it has not yet warped and it cleans up very nicely (and yes I place these in the dishwasher using a liquid DW soap. I am hopeful that with reasonable care this set will continue to provide the type of cooking utensil I expect from more expensive brands. If you think you might want the set, do this first. Purchase one of the frying pans first. Use it as I describe and then after a month or so, if the results are as you expect, buy the set. And yes I do recommend this as a buy.UPDATE: DEC 2017There are times in ones life that one has to eat their words. The time for me is now regarding the 10 Piece Gotham cookware. I have had the set for one year and am still very impressed with the non-stick surface. Granted, I haven\'t tried to melt a plastic bag or peppermint candy in any of the pans, but again, who does. I have the whole set hanging from a pot rack so as not to potentially damage the non-stick surface. Also, I don\'t cook ANYTHING on high heat and only preheat the frying pans. The exterior coating of this set is still holding up very well and look in very good condition. The problem is WARPING. Within the past 2 months, I noticed both the fry pans and smaller pots to have a ""teetering"" effect. The warping is not to the point where one would have trouble cooking, but it is enough where heat distribution of the fry pans has become noticeably uneven. Both fry plans AND smaller pots (2) have this condition. The largest pot has yet to show any of thiswarpage. Now, I did previously state that I was impressed with these pans because they did not show warping of the bottoms. This is true and was based on the fact that the metal was thinner that my other cookware. But I now have to "" eat my words"". Granted, the pots and fry pans are still very usable but I suspect there will be more warping of the bottoms over the next year or so. The price of this set was very attractive at the time of my purchase. I haven\'t checked the price lately but suspect it will still be well within reach of the majority of buyers. I had high hopes that this set would not go the same route as my very expensive cookware did. However, I still feel that these are a recommended BUY as long as you know that you will experience warping of the pan bottoms over time.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 20, 2016', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Follow the instructions you get.', 'author': 'Amazon Customer', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I’ve only had them for a few days.I’ve fried eggs, potatoes, applesEverything came out great,', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 18, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Decent', 'author': 'Richard Vandemark', 'rating': 4, 'content': ""Was a little disappointed with the handles,they're pretty lightweight.The pots and pans work good though."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 15, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Price and quality', 'author': 'Robert holman', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Product came package professionally.. excellent company.. very satisfied with my cookware', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 23, 2024', 'is_verified': True}]"

However, using these on my regular electric stovetop, and just caring for them like I do all cookware.With such a big family living at home, I swear I spend more time in the kitchen than anywhere else! Except maybe the car driving kids to and from all over the place. So, having nice cookware makes life so much easier! I had not heard of this brand Aufranc. But, I am just learning about induction cooking. We were kind of settled for a little bit and I had not kept up on all the latest, I just have really missed my gas cooking stove. However, it is time to keep up with the latest and greatest in keeping the planet green and since we are building our house after hurricane Ian.These Nonstick Pots and Pans look great first of all - nothing to do with performance, of course, but they really are quite pretty! Sleek black granite design and promises of compatibility on all cooktops. Here’s my personal take after putting it through its paces:Safety is my top priority, and these set don't disappoint. The non-toxic coating is free of PFOS, PFOA, and PFAS—no harmful chemicals leaching into my food. Plus, it maintains the original flavors without any metallic aftertaste.An enlarged magnetic base heats up fast and evenly - much better and faster than traditional cookware. So, from stir-fry to sauce, these pans deliver consistent results I can count on every time, regardless of the type of cooktop.The sturdy Bakelite handles stay comfortable and cool, even when the heat is on. No more fumbling with oven mitts or burnt fingers! It is SO convenient! The glass lids let me see what's happening with the cooking process without lifting and losing heat or moisture.And they are so easy to clean! These are Dishwasher-safe - truly. Although, because of their coating, I have found that they are just as easy to wash by hand quickly after use thanks to the amazing non-stick coating, truly the best non-stick I have ever seen. I use less oil and produce less smoke. Often clean-up is as simple as wiping with a paper towel and rinse with water. No scrubbing required!And the Cherry on top is the warranty! A two-year warranty with excellent customer service. I admit I have not had to test the excellence of the customer service as of yes, but both statements give me peace of mind. If I encounter any issues, I know I can reach out to the Aufranc team through Amazon, but I feel really great about the fact that I have used these well over a dozen times for various different foods thus far, and I have not had any kind of trouble whatsoever.So? These nonstick pots and pans have become my kitchen go-to.

I have looked at this cookware before and have seen a few advertisements on it. In the past, I hesitated trying it since, in most of the pictures and videos, it looks like it has a bumpy or rough interior. When I saw the 7-quart hybrid sauce pan, I decided I had to try it to replace a 7-quart Staub Dutch oven that I have. I was so impressed by this sauce pan, I decided to buy the 12-piece set of this cookware. This set was shipped in two boxes. One box include the 6-piece pot set with lids ( 2 and 3 quart pots and 8 quart stock pot), and the other box included the 6-piece frying pan set with lids (8, 10, and 12 inch frying pans with lids).I cook quite a lot and have quit a lot of cookware of various types and brands, including Staub, Le Creuset, cast iron, , Tramontina, carbon steel, Calphalon stainless steel, and Ninja Premium cookware. In most of these, I have complete, or almost complete, sets of every piece available in each type of cookware. Each of these has their pros and cons, and all are very non-stick aside from cast iron and carbon steel that must be well seasoned.Since this review is for the HexClad cookware, I will not get into the pros and cons of each type of cookware, but will compare the HexClad cookware to some of them and let you know why I prefer this cookware over some of the others.It should be noted that it is suggested to wash and season the cookware with vegetable oil before using. I used Crisco shortening which I also use on my cast iron pans. When I seasoned the pans, the oil was completely absorbed. After the initial seasoning, these pans should not need to be seasoned again even when cleaned with soap and water. Cast iron and carbon steel pans should be seasoned after every use.So, what do I like about this cookware as compared to the other cookware I have?1 - Cast iron, and enameled cast iron is very heavy and must be seasoned after every use to maintain it. This cookware does not required seasoning after it is done initially. Carbon steel is not as heavy, but must also be seasoned after every use.2 - Stainless steel cookware needs to be cleaned very time with Bar Keeper's Friend to keep it clean and shiny. The HexClad cookware does have stainless steel on the exterior, but is easier to keep looking shiny since cooking is not done on it. Wash and dry works.3 - Most of the cookware mentioned above can be relatively nonstick when used and seasoned properly and after learning how to use it. Stainless cookware can be more challenging since temperature and what you cook can be issues. Cast iron, carbon steel, and even enameled cookware depends on persistent seasoning after every use aside from the Ninja Premium cookware that maintains a nonstick, easy to clean surface as does the HexClad cookware. Other than Tramontina cookware, the nonstick surfaces of most are durable.4 - As for weight, the cast iron and enameled cast iron (Staub and Le Creuset) are the heaviest, carbon steel comes in second, and HexClad and Ninja are about the same.5- The warranty for HexClad is lifetime vs. the Ninja warranty that is 5-10 year depending on whether you register cookware on the Ninja website. For the HexClad cookware, you must save your purchase receipt.This is all of the differences I can think of for now. If I think of more, I will add them. For now, I am impressed with the HexClad cookware, but I will not likely eliminate much of the cookware I already have. As mentioned previously, each has their own benefits. I may eventually decide to eliminate some of the heavier cookware as it is more difficult to use. I may also eliminate cookware that requires more maintenance.I will update this review if my opinion changes.

Everyone is a critic. Everyone complains the pans aren\'t non-stick. It also turns out that none of these people giving the pans terrible reviews seem to have the faintest idea how to cook in the first place.If you dump scrambled eggs into a dry non-stick pan of any make or model, they\'re going to stick. And probably burn. Every single YouTube review tries the ""egg test"" by putting an egg into a hot, dry pan and guess what happens? If you dump frozen ravioli into a dry non-stick pan, they aren\'t going to thaw, much less cook, and they\'ll have scorch marks. If you try to make fried rice in a non-stick wok but don\'t use a drop of oil, the rice is going to stick and burn. If I tune into your HexClad product review and you tell me that you had to go to the store to buy vegetable oil to season the pans because you don\'t normally use any in your cooking, I\'m going to turn that video right off.So here\'s the deal: Are HexClad non-stick pans? Yes. And also no. They are hybrid cookware. But they are unique hybrid cookware unlike any I\'ve owned or tried. Must you use some oil in your cooking? 100% yes. It\'s actually in the instruction sheet that comes with the pans. Also, it\'s proper technique. How else are you going to ensure proper heat transfer to the food? Again, think about what you\'re buying here: hybrid cookware. A hybrid of what? A hybrid of non-stick cookware, which, no matter the brand, still will require some kind of oil or fat to be properly non-stick, and of stainless steel cookware, which most definitely requires oil or fat to be non-stick.The bottom line on this whole ""they aren\'t non-stick"" nonsense is that they most certainly are. When you want them to be. When you use proper cooking techniques.Now, how did they work out for me? I\'m not a chef. I\'m a home cook. But I like to think I\'m an above average home cook. Two of my good friends are foodies. One of them actually is a chef. The other is a skilled home cook and recently purchased a set of HexClad, which he really likes. We often cook and eat together.First test, after following the seasoning instructions, was with the 12"" pan. I made sichuan chicken using boneless, skinless chicken thighs. While skeptical at first, I heated the pan on medium low as instructed, thinking no way is this going to be hot enough. With a little oil in the pan once it came up to temperature (within 2 minutes at that), the chicken cooked and even browned. Developed a nice sear on the outside. Beautiful, gorgeous color. And yet, when turning the meat it released from the pan with zero resistance and no residue left stuck on the pan surface. Removing the chicken, I added a tbsp more oil and in went the peppers and onion. Again, a gorgeous result. Nice searing and no sticking. Added the meat back, added sauce, and the same meal I had prepared the night before in my quality non-stick skillet actually looked far more appetizing. And it was delicious. I dare say, even better due to the increased Maillard reaction over standard non-stick pans. Clean up entailed a wet sponge and a gentle wipe and rinse and it was clean. Nothing stuck. No discoloration. Soap and water finish.After enjoying my meal, I just had to know if the pans were going to pass the test that would make them a keeper for me: the French Omelette test. So I heated up the 10"" pan, scrambled and seasoned three eggs, and threw a knob of butter into the pan. Medium low heat was plenty enough to get the job done. I worked quickly, keeping the eggs moving to avoid forming large curds. Once nearly set, I began rolling. The egg came away from the pan without a single stick, and without even the need to add more butter to release it as I would in my regular non-stick pans. Perfect, soft, yellow (not browned), creamy French Omelette. Clean up was a non-event. Aside from a bit of butter there wasn\'t anything for the soap, water, and sponge to remove. This test sealed the deal for me.I have other decent pans: All-Clad D3 12"" and 10"" pans, and three non-stick Oxo 8"", 10"", and 12"" pans (top rated by America\'s Test Kitchen). The All-Clads can work okay, but they were mostly a disappointment. They take too long to heat up, the heat dissipates quickly when food is added, and they have cold spots around the outside where there isn\'t direct flame. The Oxo pans are actually pretty great, but they have rubber handles which can\'t go into the oven, and even medium heat just isn\'t hot enough. Not the pan\'s fault, but you\'ll never get a sear on a non-stick surface. My goal here was to have ONE set of pans that could get proper searing, could be used in the oven, and still have non-stick properties. I have achieved that goal with the HexClad pans. My All-Clad and Oxo pans will be gifted to someone. I have no need for them anymore.Handles: Nice, fat handles on the HexClad that don\'t turn in your hands or get hot. The worst thing about the All-Clad D3\'s are the handles. I have nearly dumped the contents of both pans when tossing as the handles rotated in my palm. They are the absolute worst. I absolutely LOVE the HexClad handles.Lids: Every HexClad pan came with a nice, glass lid that fits perfectly, and has a steam vent. All-Clad? Because my D3 set didn\'t come with lids initially, All-Clad doesn\'t and won\'t sell them separately. I called All-Clad when I got them and asked if they\'d sell me some lids and they basically told me to go pound sand. They were actually rude and dismissive.Heat distribution: As mentioned, the All-Clad D3\'s didn\'t evenly distribute the heat to the outsides of the pan surface that weren\'t directly over flame, nor did they keep the heat when food was added. Even cranking the flame up to high was never enough to get a good sear. Not so with the HexClad. I was sure that the warning to not heat them above medium had something to do with the non-stick surface (and it might), but it\'s just not necessary to go any higher. The outsides of the pan are just as hot as the middle and they sear so well, keeping their heat even as food is added. They perform almost like carbon steel or cast iron in this regard.Non-stick: Covered this, but it bears repeating that these actually are non-stick when used properly.Appearance: They\'re gorgeous, aren\'t they? My friend\'s set has no discoloration after several months of daily, hard use, and he\'s never had to use Barkeeper\'s Friend or any scouring. They are absolutely stunning under the LED cook lights of my hood. Prettier by far than the All-Clad.I\'ve ordered the 2, 3, and 8 QT pot set, which arrives tomorrow, and expect to be equally happy if these pans are any indication. I also have a 10"" wok arriving next week for my near daily stir fries. At some point, I may also add a 1 QT pot and 7 QT deep saute.The bottom line is that these pans aren\'t going to miraculously make you cook better. But they WILL reward good technique with superior results. I was skeptical coming into this that I wouldn\'t like them nearly as much as what I already had but any hesitation is gone. The hype is real with this tech.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 16, 2022', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars This was part of the 12-piece set I ordered', 'author': 'Judy L.', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""This was part of the 12 piece set I ordered that was shipped in 2 boxes. I have looked at this cookware before and have seen a few advertisements on it. In the past, I hesitated trying it since, in most of the pictures and videos, it looks like it has a bumpy or rough interior. When I saw the 7-quart hybrid sauce pan, I decided I had to try it to replace a 7-quart Staub Dutch oven that I have. I was so impressed by this sauce pan, I decided to buy the 12-piece set of this cookware. This set was shipped in two boxes. One box include the 6-piece pot set with lids ( 2 and 3 quart pots and 8 quart stock pot), and the other box included the 6-piece frying pan set with lids (8, 10, and 12 inch frying pans with lids).I cook quite a lot and have quit a lot of cookware of various types and brands, including Staub, Le Creuset, cast iron, , Tramontina, carbon steel, Calphalon stainless steel, and Ninja Premium cookware. In most of these, I have complete, or almost complete, sets of every piece available in each type of cookware. Each of these has their pros and cons, and all are very non-stick aside from cast iron and carbon steel that must be well seasoned.Since this review is for the HexClad cookware, I will not get into the pros and cons of each type of cookware, but will compare the HexClad cookware to some of them and let you know why I prefer this cookware over some of the others.It should be noted that it is suggested to wash and season the cookware with vegetable oil before using. I used Crisco shortening which I also use on my cast iron pans. When I seasoned the pans, the oil was completely absorbed. After the initial seasoning, these pans should not need to be seasoned again even when cleaned with soap and water. Cast iron and carbon steel pans should be seasoned after every use.So, what do I like about this cookware as compared to the other cookware I have?1 - Cast iron, and enameled cast iron is very heavy and must be seasoned after every use to maintain it. This cookware does not required seasoning after it is done initially. Carbon steel is not as heavy, but must also be seasoned after every use.2 - Stainless steel cookware needs to be cleaned very time with Bar Keeper's Friend to keep it clean and shiny. The HexClad cookware does have stainless steel on the exterior, but is easier to keep looking shiny since cooking is not done on it. Wash and dry works.3 - Most of the cookware mentioned above can be relatively nonstick when used and seasoned properly and after learning how to use it. Stainless cookware can be more challenging since temperature and what you cook can be issues. Cast iron, carbon steel, and even enameled cookware depends on persistent seasoning after every use aside from the Ninja Premium cookware that maintains a nonstick, easy to clean surface as does the HexClad cookware. Other than Tramontina cookware, the nonstick surfaces of most are durable.4 - As for weight, the cast iron and enameled cast iron (Staub and Le Creuset) are the heaviest, carbon steel comes in second, and HexClad and Ninja are about the same.5- The warranty for HexClad is lifetime vs. the Ninja warranty that is 5-10 year depending on whether you register cookware on the Ninja website. For the HexClad cookware, you must save your purchase receipt.This is all of the differences I can think of for now. If I think of more, I will add them. For now, I am impressed with the HexClad cookware, but I will not likely eliminate much of the cookware I already have. As mentioned previously, each has their own benefits. I may eventually decide to eliminate some of the heavier cookware as it is more difficult to use. I may also eliminate cookware that requires more maintenance.I will update this review if my opinion changes. I hope this review was helpful for you."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 12, 2023', 'is_verified': True}]"

Very unique color.During the day, with natural sunlight it looks like a darker purple. At night, under the reflection of the spotlights over the stovetop, its color changes to a more vivid, lighter color. The outer coating looks really nice.One reason we got this set is that it uses a ceramic nonstick coating, which doesn't contain the problematic materials of old nonstick coatings.Duralon is the brand name of their ceramic coating, and this appears to be a newer, and I would expect, more durable iteration.Another thing I noticed is that these are lighter than other pans, however the heat dissipates evenly. These are also suitable for induction cooking, which requires a good metal base, to that explains why these heat evenly. Our stovetop however is gas.The set is fairly complete, with different pots and pans, small and medium sized.Each pot has a lid. Two of the larger pots have the same circumference, so the lids for both are the same and although they could've omitted one of the lids, this set has all of them. Also the large pot comes with a matching steaming basket. There is enough clearance on the bottom of the pot when using the steamer for a good amount of water.Each of the lids has like dots sticking out. This is to better manage the vapor inside the pot when the lid is on. Very nice detail.The handles are solid and don't get too hot. One can easily handle the pans without cooking mittens.Overall, I'm impressed with this set, better than I expected. And I like the distinctive eggplant color.

Sleek, modern, and that G10 Duralon ceramic coating – it\'s like the red carpet for my food. And can we talk about how lightweight these bad boys are? It\'s like cooking with clouds – no more bicep workouts just to lift a pan.Now, the non-stick situation is legit. I made pancakes, and they slid off the pan like they were auditioning for a cooking show. Easy clean-up vibes for sure. The cool-touch handles are a game-changer. No more oven mitts acrobatics – I can handle my pots and pans like a kitchen boss.But, and here\'s the tiny hiccup, the handles can get a bit wobbly. It\'s like they\'re doing the salsa dance while I\'m sautéing. Nothing major, just a gentle reminder to tighten things up. Also, the ""induction-ready"" claim is a bit of a tease. My induction stove took a minute to warm up to the idea. It\'s like waiting for a friend who\'s fashionably late – a bit annoying but worth it in the end.Nuwave, a small suggestion – how about throwing in a recipe card or a cheeky kitchen magnet with each set? A little extra spice to welcome us to the Nuwave family.In a nutshell, the Lux set has upgraded my kitchen from zero to hero.

The lids fit nicely, and enable you to make all your favorite dishes.The cookware is easy to clean, and can handle high temps, which is important. The hard coating makes them nice from a scratch resistant perspective too. They heat up evenly, and my food has come out tasting nicely. My only wish is that they come with clear lids. That isn’t that big a deal because let’s face it, lids steam up, and can be hard to see through, but it still makes it nice to have them. That aside, I have no complaints about these.

After researching various options, I decided to invest in the Cuisinart 11-Piece Cookware Set, and I must say, I am thoroughly impressed.One of the standout features of this cookware set is its exceptional heat distribution. Compared to my old pans, I noticed a significant improvement in how evenly heat was distributed throughout the cooking surface. I experimented by heating the middle of the pan while placing the food to the side, and the results were outstanding. This even heat distribution allowed for precise cooking and eliminated hot spots, ensuring that my dishes cooked uniformly every time.Cleaning these stainless steel pots and pans was also a breeze. I had expected it to be a bit more challenging, but to my surprise, a simple combination of water and dish soap was all it took to scrape off any food residue and restore them to their pristine condition. This ease of cleaning has made cooking and cleanup much more efficient, saving me time and effort in the kitchen.Aside from their functionality, I am also impressed by the aesthetic appeal of this cookware set. The simple yet elegant stainless steel design adds a touch of class to my kitchen. There's something timeless and sophisticated about the look of stainless steel cookware that I find appealing, and this set perfectly embodies that.Overall, I couldn't be happier with my purchase of the Cuisinart 11-Piece Cookware Set. Not only does it meet my cooking needs with its excellent heat distribution and easy cleanup, but it also adds a stylish element to my kitchen. If you're considering making the switch to stainless steel cookware, I highly recommend giving this set a try. It's a worthwhile investment that delivers on both performance and aesthetics."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States March 2, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars A Great Set of Cookware', 'author': 'Grammy05', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Let me preface this review with the fact that I am Italian and raised 5 children on daily home-cooked meals. The kitchen is the center of my home. So when my daughter got her own apartment out west and asked for a set of pots for Christmas, I wanted to make sure I got her a quality set that would last her for years and years. I knew what I wanted for her, but didn\'t know which brand to purchase. Non-stick was out (I have never liked it). The pots also had to be both dishwasher/oven safe, and I wanted the pot handles to be riveted into the pot. Off I went to the mall with my ""specifications"" in hand to look at the different brands and sets available. Boy was I amazed at how many there were! I took my time and examined each set. Not only did I look at the sets, but I also handled the sets. This is VERY important. Many of the quality sets were so heavy that I needed two hands to lift the larger pieces, and although I could lift the smaller saucepans, I had difficulty tilting them to the side to pour. Others had handles that were very uncomfortable to use. Then I came upon the Cuisinart Chef\'s Classic Stainless 10-piece cookware set. I was very impressed by the quality. They were heavy grade yet easy to handle. They also met my other specifications listed above AND they looked really nice as well. The price of $149 was quite unbelievable. I drove home and ran straight to my computer and ordered the set through Amazon. I got free shipping and had the set delivered directly to my daughter. I also used the holiday bonus coupon for $25 off my order. I was so impressed with the set and the deal Amazon was offering, a few days later I purchased a second set through Amazon for myself. I LOVE them. They cook beautifully on my gas range and clean up well in the dishwasher. The handles DO NOT get hot while cooking, which totally surprised me. Do be careful with the lid handles though. They will get hot if cooking on higher heat. I haven\'t had a problem with delicate foods burning due to the high thermoconductivity of the pans; however, my stove is a professional grade 6-burner unit. I don\'t know if that makes any difference or not. All I can say is this set looks great, cooks great, handles great, and sells at a great price. What more can you ask for?', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 13, 2005', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Very happy with this set', 'author': 'Kevin', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I had some older non-stick pans leftover from college, but the non-stick coating was starting to flake off, so it was time for new pans. I really like cooking, so I wanted something that was good quality and would last a long time. Since I was replacing most of my pans, going with a set was the best value for my money. I read lots of reviews about different types of cookware and different brands and finally settled on this set. This is a very good quality set for a great price.As of this review, I have been using this set for 2 months, so I am not able to comment on the long term use of the set. However, everything seems solidly constructed and if properly cared for, I think the set can last a long time. This set had everything that I was looking for. It would be nice if the set included a larger (12"") skillet, but I already owned a 12"" stainless steel skillet that I bought by itself, so it ended up working out for me.If you are used to other types of cookware, especially non-stick, you have to get used to cooking with lower heat and properly prepping the pan so that things don\'t stick. Heat the pan first, then add some oil to coat the bottom of the pan, allow the oil to heat up, then add the food. I have cooked a good variety of foods with this set and have had good results. As always, sometimes things get messed up when cooking, but I am going to blame that on the cook and not the pans. I have successfully cooked fish and eggs (although I typically use my cast iron for eggs) in these pans without sticking. For fish, making sure that the pan and oil is hot enough will allow the fish to slide and not stick when you put it in the pan. A light layer of flour on the fish can also help. Contrary to what many people say about leaving the food alone and that it will release from the pan on its own, for fish I move the pan around to keep the fish sliding for the first 10-15 seconds to allow it to develop a crust, then I leave it alone. No sticking (Alton Brown taught me this [...]). On the other hand, for cooking some things, you want some little bits to stick to the pan, and you can accomplish that too.I don\'t have a dishwasher, so I have only hand washed these pans. I use just dish soap and a sponge most of the time, but every one in a while I use Bar Keeper\'s Friend to clean them up and help keep them shiny. The pans are all still shiny. You can see some tiny scratches on the bottom when you tilt them the right way in the light, but in no way is the integrity of the pan damaged. If you expect these pans to never get a single scratch and maintain a perfect mirror finish, then take them out of the box, hang them up, and never use them. From use and cleaning, the surface of the pans will get some micro scratches, but these in no way affect how the pans work. To make cleanup easier, run some hot water in the warm pan after cooking to wash out what you can and let it soak for a little if there is anything stuck in the pan. Don\'t run cold water into a hot pan and let the pan cool a little bit before running water in it, otherwise you could damage the pan by rapidly changing the temperature. Also, don\'t leave water sitting in the pan for long periods of time. Let it soak for a while if you need to and then clean up the pan. I usually let them air dry for a little, then wipe them down with a towel and hang them back up.The metal lids fit very well with the pans, but because of the way they are shaped, you are not able to cover anything other than the pans (i.e. a plate) like you could with a glass lid. The lids work great for what they were designed for, so I can\'t fault them for that. Be careful, the lids can get hot if you cover a hot pan with them, so make sure you use a pot holder or towel. Because the lids don\'t have a lip that lets you hang them, I grabbed some S hooks from the hardware store and hang them by the handle. I\'m limited on cabinet space, so I have to hang all of my pans and lids, but I also think it is nice because keeps them from banging into each other.The handles for the pans, on the other hand stay cool enough that you can grab with your bare hand (just don\'t grab it close to where it connects to the pan). It is always good to be safe and test the handle first before grabbing, just to make sure. I have had times where the handle was too close to another pot on my small stove and did get hot.The last thing I love about these pans is the lip around the edge. Pouring liquids from these is just amazing. The liquid funnels down to a single point, making it easy to control, and there is no dripping or splashing.I highly recommend this set to anyone looking for a good deal on a set of quality pans.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 12, 2013', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars I am pleased with the appearance and performance', 'author': 'M on Amazon', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'People are too unaccustomed to non-stick style pans. When you choose stainless steel cookware you will need to learn how to cook and clean using stainless steel cookware. If you are an old dog who has trouble learning new tricks stainless steel is not for you.These work great with my gas stove. YMMV. I am used to Anolon non-stick costing 2x+ more than this yet for the price this Cuisinart stainless steel set is pretty nice. I took advantage of the sale on this set which includes the steamer. Cuisinart is discontinuing the steamer piece and is selling off the new old stock. The same set absent the steamer is being sold at a close price. I will never use the steamer but I saved a few dollars getting the set with it and the this set came with clear see-through lids instead of metal.Pros: Beautiful finish, comfortable and balanced long handles on the frying pans, even heat distribution (using gas), easy cleaning, also I like the vibe of chrome and stainless steel cookware on the stove instead of the dark gunmetal of Anolon. I was a huge fan of Anolon for years. ALL non-stick eventually wears out and sticks and you have to replace them. Now I prefer stainless steel. I read how to cook using stainless steel and so far I have have near perfect results of no sticking.Cons: The handles and the glass of the lids get hot and stay hot for a longer time than I expected and am used to. There is more play to slide around and they don\'t feel as well made compared to the 2x+ $ Anolon, again at half the cost of the Anolon I am just mentioning it not complaining.Tip: I read that to clean off stuck on food pour white vinegar and some water in the pan and bring it to a boil. IT WORKS! The first time using the frying pan I fried potatoes and there was some food that easily came off when I boiled water and vinegar in the pan. For actual ""stains"" use Bar Keepers Friend and a non-scratch cleaning pad after the vinegar treatment.

Hwang', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I've purchased two sets about six months ago and had a chance to use every piece. I have to say that this set is a bargain, but noticed that Cuisinart Multiclad Pro is what I would prefer over this set (if money was no object). I've purchased the Multiclad Pro 3 qt saucepan and the 5-1/2 qt pan to compliment this set, and love the true triple ply and heavier gauge sides which prevents scorching. Can't compare this set to the Cuisinart Multiclad Pro set that cost two to three times as much (or All-Clad)...and I'm quite happy that I have purchased this set!As for the 10-piece set, I agree with the high praise from many already posted. This is a very good set for a resonable price. Would it last a lifetime? Probably not but I will get good use out of it for at least ten years. Sides of pan are a bit thin and will flex slightly (compared to the Multiclad models). If the pan fell from my hanging rack, it would probably dent. You can hang the pots with lids on, though one would have to be careful not to knock them off. One of the lids came off and hit the countertop then the floor, but survived the fall without any damage. My favorite is the 3 qt saucepan and the 3-1/2 qt saute.Cameo or Bar Keepers Friend does a good job of cleaning up residue that can't be cleaned up with standard dish washing soap or in the dishwasher. I have some pitting on the interior of pan from throwing salt from soft-boiling eggs or pasta. Pitting does not impact the performance, but a bit ugly looking (doesn't bother me as this set was inexpensive and I've purchased to use everyday). I've done a comparison between the 3 qt provided in this set compared to the Multiclad 3 qt. I was surprised that using same amount of water an at same size gas burners with switching the pans every minute to ensure even heating, Chef's Classic boiled water quicker than the Multiclad by at least a minute (I'm a professional engineer and a bit quirky that way).I've also purchased the anodized non-stick pans by Cuisinart and been using the glass lids from that set on the Chef's Classic. Since purchasing the stainless set, my non-stick pans are in storage and though they are fairly new, teflon started coming off from the top of the cookware where lid meets the pan. I realize the professionals use metal lids as it keeps in the heat better and easier to clean, but I do like to see what's going on inside the cookware when I'm cooking. I'm starting to get used to the metal lids. This set has also retired my Lodge cast iron cookware to use only on the grill, as the stainless base heat retention is great and much easier to clean and maintain.I would highly recommend this set to anyone who wants a long lasting cookware, likes to use metal utensils with their cookware as long as they don't mind superficial scratches(instruction manual states that non-metallic utensils be used), enjoys developing fond (brown bits) for making tasty sauces, or simply wants a cookware that one can abuse without having to worry about ingesting Teflon, this set would be very satisfactory. If you want the absolute best and spend considerable time in the kitchen, spend more for the Cuisinart Multiclad or All-Clad and don't complain about the little details. For most everyone else out there, this set would be quite adequate. Happy cooking!Other Info: As for interchangeability with Cuisinart Multiclad line, 3-qt line has different size lids as Multiclas line has deeper Saute pans. Frying pans are the same size. Pam or similar cooking spray should be avoided as they will bake on to the pans and will be difficult to remove. I've started to cook eggs on real butter mixed with olive oil. Wow! Eggs are so much better than cooked on the non-stick skillet with spray oil.

I have looked at this cookware before and have seen a few advertisements on it. In the past, I hesitated trying it since, in most of the pictures and videos, it looks like it has a bumpy or rough interior. When I saw the 7-quart hybrid sauce pan, I decided I had to try it to replace a 7-quart Staub Dutch oven that I have. I was so impressed by this sauce pan, I decided to buy the 12-piece set of this cookware. This set was shipped in two boxes. One box include the 6-piece pot set with lids ( 2 and 3 quart pots and 8 quart stock pot), and the other box included the 6-piece frying pan set with lids (8, 10, and 12 inch frying pans with lids).I cook quite a lot and have quit a lot of cookware of various types and brands, including Staub, Le Creuset, cast iron, , Tramontina, carbon steel, Calphalon stainless steel, and Ninja Premium cookware. In most of these, I have complete, or almost complete, sets of every piece available in each type of cookware. Each of these has their pros and cons, and all are very non-stick aside from cast iron and carbon steel that must be well seasoned.Since this review is for the HexClad cookware, I will not get into the pros and cons of each type of cookware, but will compare the HexClad cookware to some of them and let you know why I prefer this cookware over some of the others.It should be noted that it is suggested to wash and season the cookware with vegetable oil before using. I used Crisco shortening which I also use on my cast iron pans. When I seasoned the pans, the oil was completely absorbed. After the initial seasoning, these pans should not need to be seasoned again even when cleaned with soap and water. Cast iron and carbon steel pans should be seasoned after every use.So, what do I like about this cookware as compared to the other cookware I have?1 - Cast iron, and enameled cast iron is very heavy and must be seasoned after every use to maintain it. This cookware does not required seasoning after it is done initially. Carbon steel is not as heavy, but must also be seasoned after every use.2 - Stainless steel cookware needs to be cleaned very time with Bar Keeper's Friend to keep it clean and shiny. The HexClad cookware does have stainless steel on the exterior, but is easier to keep looking shiny since cooking is not done on it. Wash and dry works.3 - Most of the cookware mentioned above can be relatively nonstick when used and seasoned properly and after learning how to use it. Stainless cookware can be more challenging since temperature and what you cook can be issues. Cast iron, carbon steel, and even enameled cookware depends on persistent seasoning after every use aside from the Ninja Premium cookware that maintains a nonstick, easy to clean surface as does the HexClad cookware. Other than Tramontina cookware, the nonstick surfaces of most are durable.4 - As for weight, the cast iron and enameled cast iron (Staub and Le Creuset) are the heaviest, carbon steel comes in second, and HexClad and Ninja are about the same.5- The warranty for HexClad is lifetime vs. the Ninja warranty that is 5-10 year depending on whether you register cookware on the Ninja website. For the HexClad cookware, you must save your purchase receipt.This is all of the differences I can think of for now. If I think of more, I will add them. For now, I am impressed with the HexClad cookware, but I will not likely eliminate much of the cookware I already have. As mentioned previously, each has their own benefits. I may eventually decide to eliminate some of the heavier cookware as it is more difficult to use. I may also eliminate cookware that requires more maintenance.I will update this review if my opinion changes.

Yes, they are scratch resistant, NOT scratch proof.These are not your typical nonstick or stainless steel skillets. They are designed to work with the functionality of both styles of pans.

Everyone is a critic. Everyone complains the pans aren\'t non-stick. It also turns out that none of these people giving the pans terrible reviews seem to have the faintest idea how to cook in the first place.If you dump scrambled eggs into a dry non-stick pan of any make or model, they\'re going to stick. And probably burn. Every single YouTube review tries the ""egg test"" by putting an egg into a hot, dry pan and guess what happens? If you dump frozen ravioli into a dry non-stick pan, they aren\'t going to thaw, much less cook, and they\'ll have scorch marks. If you try to make fried rice in a non-stick wok but don\'t use a drop of oil, the rice is going to stick and burn. If I tune into your HexClad product review and you tell me that you had to go to the store to buy vegetable oil to season the pans because you don\'t normally use any in your cooking, I\'m going to turn that video right off.So here\'s the deal: Are HexClad non-stick pans? Yes. And also no. They are hybrid cookware. But they are unique hybrid cookware unlike any I\'ve owned or tried. Must you use some oil in your cooking? 100% yes. It\'s actually in the instruction sheet that comes with the pans. Also, it\'s proper technique. How else are you going to ensure proper heat transfer to the food? Again, think about what you\'re buying here: hybrid cookware. A hybrid of what? A hybrid of non-stick cookware, which, no matter the brand, still will require some kind of oil or fat to be properly non-stick, and of stainless steel cookware, which most definitely requires oil or fat to be non-stick.The bottom line on this whole ""they aren\'t non-stick"" nonsense is that they most certainly are. When you want them to be. When you use proper cooking techniques.Now, how did they work out for me? I\'m not a chef. I\'m a home cook. But I like to think I\'m an above average home cook. Two of my good friends are foodies. One of them actually is a chef. The other is a skilled home cook and recently purchased a set of HexClad, which he really likes. We often cook and eat together.First test, after following the seasoning instructions, was with the 12"" pan. I made sichuan chicken using boneless, skinless chicken thighs. While skeptical at first, I heated the pan on medium low as instructed, thinking no way is this going to be hot enough. With a little oil in the pan once it came up to temperature (within 2 minutes at that), the chicken cooked and even browned. Developed a nice sear on the outside. Beautiful, gorgeous color. And yet, when turning the meat it released from the pan with zero resistance and no residue left stuck on the pan surface. Removing the chicken, I added a tbsp more oil and in went the peppers and onion. Again, a gorgeous result. Nice searing and no sticking. Added the meat back, added sauce, and the same meal I had prepared the night before in my quality non-stick skillet actually looked far more appetizing. And it was delicious. I dare say, even better due to the increased Maillard reaction over standard non-stick pans. Clean up entailed a wet sponge and a gentle wipe and rinse and it was clean. Nothing stuck. No discoloration. Soap and water finish.After enjoying my meal, I just had to know if the pans were going to pass the test that would make them a keeper for me: the French Omelette test. So I heated up the 10"" pan, scrambled and seasoned three eggs, and threw a knob of butter into the pan. Medium low heat was plenty enough to get the job done. I worked quickly, keeping the eggs moving to avoid forming large curds. Once nearly set, I began rolling. The egg came away from the pan without a single stick, and without even the need to add more butter to release it as I would in my regular non-stick pans. Perfect, soft, yellow (not browned), creamy French Omelette. Clean up was a non-event. Aside from a bit of butter there wasn\'t anything for the soap, water, and sponge to remove. This test sealed the deal for me.I have other decent pans: All-Clad D3 12"" and 10"" pans, and three non-stick Oxo 8"", 10"", and 12"" pans (top rated by America\'s Test Kitchen). The All-Clads can work okay, but they were mostly a disappointment. They take too long to heat up, the heat dissipates quickly when food is added, and they have cold spots around the outside where there isn\'t direct flame. The Oxo pans are actually pretty great, but they have rubber handles which can\'t go into the oven, and even medium heat just isn\'t hot enough. Not the pan\'s fault, but you\'ll never get a sear on a non-stick surface. My goal here was to have ONE set of pans that could get proper searing, could be used in the oven, and still have non-stick properties. I have achieved that goal with the HexClad pans. My All-Clad and Oxo pans will be gifted to someone. I have no need for them anymore.Handles: Nice, fat handles on the HexClad that don\'t turn in your hands or get hot. The worst thing about the All-Clad D3\'s are the handles. I have nearly dumped the contents of both pans when tossing as the handles rotated in my palm. They are the absolute worst. I absolutely LOVE the HexClad handles.Lids: Every HexClad pan came with a nice, glass lid that fits perfectly, and has a steam vent. All-Clad? Because my D3 set didn\'t come with lids initially, All-Clad doesn\'t and won\'t sell them separately. I called All-Clad when I got them and asked if they\'d sell me some lids and they basically told me to go pound sand. They were actually rude and dismissive.Heat distribution: As mentioned, the All-Clad D3\'s didn\'t evenly distribute the heat to the outsides of the pan surface that weren\'t directly over flame, nor did they keep the heat when food was added. Even cranking the flame up to high was never enough to get a good sear. Not so with the HexClad. I was sure that the warning to not heat them above medium had something to do with the non-stick surface (and it might), but it\'s just not necessary to go any higher. The outsides of the pan are just as hot as the middle and they sear so well, keeping their heat even as food is added. They perform almost like carbon steel or cast iron in this regard.Non-stick: Covered this, but it bears repeating that these actually are non-stick when used properly.Appearance: They\'re gorgeous, aren\'t they? My friend\'s set has no discoloration after several months of daily, hard use, and he\'s never had to use Barkeeper\'s Friend or any scouring. They are absolutely stunning under the LED cook lights of my hood. Prettier by far than the All-Clad.I\'ve ordered the 2, 3, and 8 QT pot set, which arrives tomorrow, and expect to be equally happy if these pans are any indication. I also have a 10"" wok arriving next week for my near daily stir fries. At some point, I may also add a 1 QT pot and 7 QT deep saute.The bottom line is that these pans aren\'t going to miraculously make you cook better. But they WILL reward good technique with superior results. I was skeptical coming into this that I wouldn\'t like them nearly as much as what I already had but any hesitation is gone. The hype is real with this tech.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 16, 2022', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars This was part of the 12-piece set I ordered', 'author': 'Judy L.', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""This was part of the 12 piece set I ordered that was shipped in 2 boxes. I have looked at this cookware before and have seen a few advertisements on it. In the past, I hesitated trying it since, in most of the pictures and videos, it looks like it has a bumpy or rough interior. When I saw the 7-quart hybrid sauce pan, I decided I had to try it to replace a 7-quart Staub Dutch oven that I have. I was so impressed by this sauce pan, I decided to buy the 12-piece set of this cookware. This set was shipped in two boxes. One box include the 6-piece pot set with lids ( 2 and 3 quart pots and 8 quart stock pot), and the other box included the 6-piece frying pan set with lids (8, 10, and 12 inch frying pans with lids).I cook quite a lot and have quit a lot of cookware of various types and brands, including Staub, Le Creuset, cast iron, , Tramontina, carbon steel, Calphalon stainless steel, and Ninja Premium cookware. In most of these, I have complete, or almost complete, sets of every piece available in each type of cookware. Each of these has their pros and cons, and all are very non-stick aside from cast iron and carbon steel that must be well seasoned.Since this review is for the HexClad cookware, I will not get into the pros and cons of each type of cookware, but will compare the HexClad cookware to some of them and let you know why I prefer this cookware over some of the others.It should be noted that it is suggested to wash and season the cookware with vegetable oil before using. I used Crisco shortening which I also use on my cast iron pans. When I seasoned the pans, the oil was completely absorbed. After the initial seasoning, these pans should not need to be seasoned again even when cleaned with soap and water. Cast iron and carbon steel pans should be seasoned after every use.So, what do I like about this cookware as compared to the other cookware I have?1 - Cast iron, and enameled cast iron is very heavy and must be seasoned after every use to maintain it. This cookware does not required seasoning after it is done initially. Carbon steel is not as heavy, but must also be seasoned after every use.2 - Stainless steel cookware needs to be cleaned very time with Bar Keeper's Friend to keep it clean and shiny. The HexClad cookware does have stainless steel on the exterior, but is easier to keep looking shiny since cooking is not done on it. Wash and dry works.3 - Most of the cookware mentioned above can be relatively nonstick when used and seasoned properly and after learning how to use it. Stainless cookware can be more challenging since temperature and what you cook can be issues. Cast iron, carbon steel, and even enameled cookware depends on persistent seasoning after every use aside from the Ninja Premium cookware that maintains a nonstick, easy to clean surface as does the HexClad cookware. Other than Tramontina cookware, the nonstick surfaces of most are durable.4 - As for weight, the cast iron and enameled cast iron (Staub and Le Creuset) are the heaviest, carbon steel comes in second, and HexClad and Ninja are about the same.5- The warranty for HexClad is lifetime vs. the Ninja warranty that is 5-10 year depending on whether you register cookware on the Ninja website. For the HexClad cookware, you must save your purchase receipt.This is all of the differences I can think of for now. If I think of more, I will add them. For now, I am impressed with the HexClad cookware, but I will not likely eliminate much of the cookware I already have. As mentioned previously, each has their own benefits. I may eventually decide to eliminate some of the heavier cookware as it is more difficult to use. I may also eliminate cookware that requires more maintenance.I will update this review if my opinion changes. I hope this review was helpful for you."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 12, 2023', 'is_verified': True}]"

I chose the Cool Grey set with the beautiful dark blue ceramic coating, and let me tell you, this set makes me feel like I'm a Michelin star chef, even though I certainly cannot cook like one!This cookware set comes with 9 pieces, 3 pots, a frying pan, a saucepan, and their corresponding lids. I was skeptical of their non-stick coating, but I seriously did not have to use any oil to cook my eggs with! It felt like some sort of sorcery...you always see eggs slide off of pans in the infomercials, but it rarely happens in real life on non-stick pans and using no oil, but here we are. These pans take quickly to the heat and it does feel like the heat distribution is very even. Usually the center of then pan is really hot and the edges not so much, which causes a lot of uneven cooking, but the frying pan is solid. It cooked my chicken evenly, as well as my hamburger patties.I definitely recommend using silicone or wooden cooking utensils on any sort of non-stick coated pots and pans because scratching them and chipping the coating is inevitable when using steel utensils. These pots and pans were very easy to clean up afterwards, there didn't seem to be much cooked-on residue that stayed on them, and they washed very easily. Always wait until your pots and pans cool down though, before washing them, because cooler water on hot metal pans will cause them to warp over time.This is a stellar set of cookware! They are worth the price and then some, honestly! I say you should replace your old and worn out cookware with this set if you can, or buy this as a lovely wedding or housewarming gift.

Upon unboxing, the pans immediately showcased superior construction compared to my previous set from another brand that I got from Costco. A large part of what drew me to this pan set when I was looking to replace my aging set was the Duralon Blue all-natural ceramic coating since it is devoid of harmful chemicals like PFAS, PTFE, PFOA, lead, and cadmium. I found this commitment to safety, coupled with the thorough third-party testing done by TÜV Rheinland impressive, highlighting Nuwave's dedication to providing a healthy cooking environment and cookware set.When it comes to testing nonstick prowess, I always turn to scrambled eggs. After seasoning the pans with a bit of oil, these pans aced the test. Fluffy, light eggs with zero sticking or burning, even without additional oil or butter. They've proven themselves with various foods and meals, demonstrating versatility in the kitchen.However, a quick note on heat conduction—these pans distribute heat efficiently. When cooking anything, especially eggs, I recommend turning the heat down once the pan is preheated to avoid any unwanted browning. Additionally, it is unnecessary to preheat these pans at a high temperature, in fact the manufacturers manual says that preheating of the pan should not exceed 300 degrees Fahrenheit. Surprisingly, while the base conducts heat effectively, the handles remain cool despite being metal and lacking additional covering. It's a thoughtful touch that enhances the overall cooking experience.One thing to keep in mind is the size of the frying pan that comes with this set—it's ideal for omelets or a single toasted cheese sandwich. If you're in need of a larger sized frying pan, you might want to explore Nuwave’s 12 pc set where the larger frying pan is included. Lastly, the 10-year warranty is a standout feature. Nuwave stands firmly behind their products, and that kind of assurance is hard to beat.

I have looked at this cookware before and have seen a few advertisements on it. In the past, I hesitated trying it since, in most of the pictures and videos, it looks like it has a bumpy or rough interior. When I saw the 7-quart hybrid sauce pan, I decided I had to try it to replace a 7-quart Staub Dutch oven that I have. I was so impressed by this sauce pan, I decided to buy the 12-piece set of this cookware. This set was shipped in two boxes. One box include the 6-piece pot set with lids ( 2 and 3 quart pots and 8 quart stock pot), and the other box included the 6-piece frying pan set with lids (8, 10, and 12 inch frying pans with lids).I cook quite a lot and have quit a lot of cookware of various types and brands, including Staub, Le Creuset, cast iron, , Tramontina, carbon steel, Calphalon stainless steel, and Ninja Premium cookware. In most of these, I have complete, or almost complete, sets of every piece available in each type of cookware. Each of these has their pros and cons, and all are very non-stick aside from cast iron and carbon steel that must be well seasoned.Since this review is for the HexClad cookware, I will not get into the pros and cons of each type of cookware, but will compare the HexClad cookware to some of them and let you know why I prefer this cookware over some of the others.It should be noted that it is suggested to wash and season the cookware with vegetable oil before using. I used Crisco shortening which I also use on my cast iron pans. When I seasoned the pans, the oil was completely absorbed. After the initial seasoning, these pans should not need to be seasoned again even when cleaned with soap and water. Cast iron and carbon steel pans should be seasoned after every use.So, what do I like about this cookware as compared to the other cookware I have?1 - Cast iron, and enameled cast iron is very heavy and must be seasoned after every use to maintain it. This cookware does not required seasoning after it is done initially. Carbon steel is not as heavy, but must also be seasoned after every use.2 - Stainless steel cookware needs to be cleaned very time with Bar Keeper's Friend to keep it clean and shiny. The HexClad cookware does have stainless steel on the exterior, but is easier to keep looking shiny since cooking is not done on it. Wash and dry works.3 - Most of the cookware mentioned above can be relatively nonstick when used and seasoned properly and after learning how to use it. Stainless cookware can be more challenging since temperature and what you cook can be issues. Cast iron, carbon steel, and even enameled cookware depends on persistent seasoning after every use aside from the Ninja Premium cookware that maintains a nonstick, easy to clean surface as does the HexClad cookware. Other than Tramontina cookware, the nonstick surfaces of most are durable.4 - As for weight, the cast iron and enameled cast iron (Staub and Le Creuset) are the heaviest, carbon steel comes in second, and HexClad and Ninja are about the same.5- The warranty for HexClad is lifetime vs. the Ninja warranty that is 5-10 year depending on whether you register cookware on the Ninja website. For the HexClad cookware, you must save your purchase receipt.This is all of the differences I can think of for now. If I think of more, I will add them. For now, I am impressed with the HexClad cookware, but I will not likely eliminate much of the cookware I already have. As mentioned previously, each has their own benefits. I may eventually decide to eliminate some of the heavier cookware as it is more difficult to use. I may also eliminate cookware that requires more maintenance.I will update this review if my opinion changes. I hope this review was helpful for you."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 12, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Really are worth the higher price so far.', 'author': 'Fuzms', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Lately I had been treating pans as almost disposable.

My opinion on that review is that she most likely didn’t follow directions when she received it and didn’t SEASON the pan first before using it; and so blamed the pan!I did not find a single flaw or scratch on any of the pieces I received.

It also turns out that none of these people giving the pans terrible reviews seem to have the faintest idea how to cook in the first place.If you dump scrambled eggs into a dry non-stick pan of any make or model, they\'re going to stick. And probably burn. Every single YouTube review tries the ""egg test"" by putting an egg into a hot, dry pan and guess what happens? If you dump frozen ravioli into a dry non-stick pan, they aren\'t going to thaw, much less cook, and they\'ll have scorch marks. If you try to make fried rice in a non-stick wok but don\'t use a drop of oil, the rice is going to stick and burn. If I tune into your HexClad product review and you tell me that you had to go to the store to buy vegetable oil to season the pans because you don\'t normally use any in your cooking, I\'m going to turn that video right off.So here\'s the deal: Are HexClad non-stick pans? Yes. And also no. They are hybrid cookware. But they are unique hybrid cookware unlike any I\'ve owned or tried. Must you use some oil in your cooking? 100% yes. It\'s actually in the instruction sheet that comes with the pans. Also, it\'s proper technique. How else are you going to ensure proper heat transfer to the food? Again, think about what you\'re buying here: hybrid cookware. A hybrid of what? A hybrid of non-stick cookware, which, no matter the brand, still will require some kind of oil or fat to be properly non-stick, and of stainless steel cookware, which most definitely requires oil or fat to be non-stick.The bottom line on this whole ""they aren\'t non-stick"" nonsense is that they most certainly are. When you want them to be. When you use proper cooking techniques.Now, how did they work out for me? I\'m not a chef. I\'m a home cook. But I like to think I\'m an above average home cook. Two of my good friends are foodies. One of them actually is a chef. The other is a skilled home cook and recently purchased a set of HexClad, which he really likes. We often cook and eat together.First test, after following the seasoning instructions, was with the 12"" pan. I made sichuan chicken using boneless, skinless chicken thighs. While skeptical at first, I heated the pan on medium low as instructed, thinking no way is this going to be hot enough. With a little oil in the pan once it came up to temperature (within 2 minutes at that), the chicken cooked and even browned. Developed a nice sear on the outside. Beautiful, gorgeous color. And yet, when turning the meat it released from the pan with zero resistance and no residue left stuck on the pan surface. Removing the chicken, I added a tbsp more oil and in went the peppers and onion. Again, a gorgeous result. Nice searing and no sticking. Added the meat back, added sauce, and the same meal I had prepared the night before in my quality non-stick skillet actually looked far more appetizing. And it was delicious. I dare say, even better due to the increased Maillard reaction over standard non-stick pans. Clean up entailed a wet sponge and a gentle wipe and rinse and it was clean. Nothing stuck. No discoloration. Soap and water finish.After enjoying my meal, I just had to know if the pans were going to pass the test that would make them a keeper for me: the French Omelette test. So I heated up the 10"" pan, scrambled and seasoned three eggs, and threw a knob of butter into the pan. Medium low heat was plenty enough to get the job done. I worked quickly, keeping the eggs moving to avoid forming large curds. Once nearly set, I began rolling. The egg came away from the pan without a single stick, and without even the need to add more butter to release it as I would in my regular non-stick pans. Perfect, soft, yellow (not browned), creamy French Omelette. Clean up was a non-event. Aside from a bit of butter there wasn\'t anything for the soap, water, and sponge to remove. This test sealed the deal for me.I have other decent pans: All-Clad D3 12"" and 10"" pans, and three non-stick Oxo 8"", 10"", and 12"" pans (top rated by America\'s Test Kitchen). The All-Clads can work okay, but they were mostly a disappointment. They take too long to heat up, the heat dissipates quickly when food is added, and they have cold spots around the outside where there isn\'t direct flame. The Oxo pans are actually pretty great, but they have rubber handles which can\'t go into the oven, and even medium heat just isn\'t hot enough. Not the pan\'s fault, but you\'ll never get a sear on a non-stick surface. My goal here was to have ONE set of pans that could get proper searing, could be used in the oven, and still have non-stick properties. I have achieved that goal with the HexClad pans. My All-Clad and Oxo pans will be gifted to someone. I have no need for them anymore.Handles: Nice, fat handles on the HexClad that don\'t turn in your hands or get hot. The worst thing about the All-Clad D3\'s are the handles. I have nearly dumped the contents of both pans when tossing as the handles rotated in my palm. They are the absolute worst. I absolutely LOVE the HexClad handles.Lids: Every HexClad pan came with a nice, glass lid that fits perfectly, and has a steam vent. All-Clad? Because my D3 set didn\'t come with lids initially, All-Clad doesn\'t and won\'t sell them separately. I called All-Clad when I got them and asked if they\'d sell me some lids and they basically told me to go pound sand. They were actually rude and dismissive.Heat distribution: As mentioned, the All-Clad D3\'s didn\'t evenly distribute the heat to the outsides of the pan surface that weren\'t directly over flame, nor did they keep the heat when food was added. Even cranking the flame up to high was never enough to get a good sear. Not so with the HexClad. I was sure that the warning to not heat them above medium had something to do with the non-stick surface (and it might), but it\'s just not necessary to go any higher. The outsides of the pan are just as hot as the middle and they sear so well, keeping their heat even as food is added. They perform almost like carbon steel or cast iron in this regard.Non-stick: Covered this, but it bears repeating that these actually are non-stick when used properly.Appearance: They\'re gorgeous, aren\'t they? My friend\'s set has no discoloration after several months of daily, hard use, and he\'s never had to use Barkeeper\'s Friend or any scouring. They are absolutely stunning under the LED cook lights of my hood. Prettier by far than the All-Clad.I\'ve ordered the 2, 3, and 8 QT pot set, which arrives tomorrow, and expect to be equally happy if these pans are any indication. I also have a 10"" wok arriving next week for my near daily stir fries. At some point, I may also add a 1 QT pot and 7 QT deep saute.The bottom line is that these pans aren\'t going to miraculously make you cook better. But they WILL reward good technique with superior results. I was skeptical coming into this that I wouldn\'t like them nearly as much as what I already had but any hesitation is gone. The hype is real with this tech.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 16, 2022', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars This was part of the 12-piece set I ordered', 'author': 'Judy L.', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""This was part of the 12 piece set I ordered that was shipped in 2 boxes. I have looked at this cookware before and have seen a few advertisements on it. In the past, I hesitated trying it since, in most of the pictures and videos, it looks like it has a bumpy or rough interior. When I saw the 7-quart hybrid sauce pan, I decided I had to try it to replace a 7-quart Staub Dutch oven that I have. I was so impressed by this sauce pan, I decided to buy the 12-piece set of this cookware. This set was shipped in two boxes. One box include the 6-piece pot set with lids ( 2 and 3 quart pots and 8 quart stock pot), and the other box included the 6-piece frying pan set with lids (8, 10, and 12 inch frying pans with lids).I cook quite a lot and have quit a lot of cookware of various types and brands, including Staub, Le Creuset, cast iron, , Tramontina, carbon steel, Calphalon stainless steel, and Ninja Premium cookware. In most of these, I have complete, or almost complete, sets of every piece available in each type of cookware. Each of these has their pros and cons, and all are very non-stick aside from cast iron and carbon steel that must be well seasoned.Since this review is for the HexClad cookware, I will not get into the pros and cons of each type of cookware, but will compare the HexClad cookware to some of them and let you know why I prefer this cookware over some of the others.It should be noted that it is suggested to wash and season the cookware with vegetable oil before using. I used Crisco shortening which I also use on my cast iron pans. When I seasoned the pans, the oil was completely absorbed. After the initial seasoning, these pans should not need to be seasoned again even when cleaned with soap and water. Cast iron and carbon steel pans should be seasoned after every use.So, what do I like about this cookware as compared to the other cookware I have?1 - Cast iron, and enameled cast iron is very heavy and must be seasoned after every use to maintain it. This cookware does not required seasoning after it is done initially. Carbon steel is not as heavy, but must also be seasoned after every use.2 - Stainless steel cookware needs to be cleaned very time with Bar Keeper's Friend to keep it clean and shiny. The HexClad cookware does have stainless steel on the exterior, but is easier to keep looking shiny since cooking is not done on it. Wash and dry works.3 - Most of the cookware mentioned above can be relatively nonstick when used and seasoned properly and after learning how to use it. Stainless cookware can be more challenging since temperature and what you cook can be issues. Cast iron, carbon steel, and even enameled cookware depends on persistent seasoning after every use aside from the Ninja Premium cookware that maintains a nonstick, easy to clean surface as does the HexClad cookware. Other than Tramontina cookware, the nonstick surfaces of most are durable.4 - As for weight, the cast iron and enameled cast iron (Staub and Le Creuset) are the heaviest, carbon steel comes in second, and HexClad and Ninja are about the same.5- The warranty for HexClad is lifetime vs. the Ninja warranty that is 5-10 year depending on whether you register cookware on the Ninja website. For the HexClad cookware, you must save your purchase receipt.This is all of the differences I can think of for now. If I think of more, I will add them. For now, I am impressed with the HexClad cookware, but I will not likely eliminate much of the cookware I already have. As mentioned previously, each has their own benefits. I may eventually decide to eliminate some of the heavier cookware as it is more difficult to use. I may also eliminate cookware that requires more maintenance.I will update this review if my opinion changes. I hope this review was helpful for you."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 12, 2023', 'is_verified': True}]"

I have looked at this cookware before and have seen a few advertisements on it. In the past, I hesitated trying it since, in most of the pictures and videos, it looks like it has a bumpy or rough interior. When I saw the 7-quart hybrid sauce pan, I decided I had to try it to replace a 7-quart Staub Dutch oven that I have. I was so impressed by this sauce pan, I decided to buy the 12-piece set of this cookware. This set was shipped in two boxes. One box include the 6-piece pot set with lids ( 2 and 3 quart pots and 8 quart stock pot), and the other box included the 6-piece frying pan set with lids (8, 10, and 12 inch frying pans with lids).I cook quite a lot and have quit a lot of cookware of various types and brands, including Staub, Le Creuset, cast iron, , Tramontina, carbon steel, Calphalon stainless steel, and Ninja Premium cookware. In most of these, I have complete, or almost complete, sets of every piece available in each type of cookware. Each of these has their pros and cons, and all are very non-stick aside from cast iron and carbon steel that must be well seasoned.Since this review is for the HexClad cookware, I will not get into the pros and cons of each type of cookware, but will compare the HexClad cookware to some of them and let you know why I prefer this cookware over some of the others.It should be noted that it is suggested to wash and season the cookware with vegetable oil before using. I used Crisco shortening which I also use on my cast iron pans. When I seasoned the pans, the oil was completely absorbed. After the initial seasoning, these pans should not need to be seasoned again even when cleaned with soap and water. Cast iron and carbon steel pans should be seasoned after every use.So, what do I like about this cookware as compared to the other cookware I have?1 - Cast iron, and enameled cast iron is very heavy and must be seasoned after every use to maintain it. This cookware does not required seasoning after it is done initially. Carbon steel is not as heavy, but must also be seasoned after every use.2 - Stainless steel cookware needs to be cleaned very time with Bar Keeper's Friend to keep it clean and shiny. The HexClad cookware does have stainless steel on the exterior, but is easier to keep looking shiny since cooking is not done on it. Wash and dry works.3 - Most of the cookware mentioned above can be relatively nonstick when used and seasoned properly and after learning how to use it. Stainless cookware can be more challenging since temperature and what you cook can be issues. Cast iron, carbon steel, and even enameled cookware depends on persistent seasoning after every use aside from the Ninja Premium cookware that maintains a nonstick, easy to clean surface as does the HexClad cookware. Other than Tramontina cookware, the nonstick surfaces of most are durable.4 - As for weight, the cast iron and enameled cast iron (Staub and Le Creuset) are the heaviest, carbon steel comes in second, and HexClad and Ninja are about the same.5- The warranty for HexClad is lifetime vs. the Ninja warranty that is 5-10 year depending on whether you register cookware on the Ninja website. For the HexClad cookware, you must save your purchase receipt.This is all of the differences I can think of for now. If I think of more, I will add them. For now, I am impressed with the HexClad cookware, but I will not likely eliminate much of the cookware I already have. As mentioned previously, each has their own benefits. I may eventually decide to eliminate some of the heavier cookware as it is more difficult to use. I may also eliminate cookware that requires more maintenance.I will update this review if my opinion changes.

Personally, I wouldn't recommend that one bit. Hexclad does give a lifetime warranty but not from minor scratches, so buyer beware. Yes, they are scratch resistant, NOT scratch proof.These are not your typical nonstick or stainless steel skillets. They are designed to work with the functionality of both styles of pans.

Everyone is a critic. Everyone complains the pans aren\'t non-stick. It also turns out that none of these people giving the pans terrible reviews seem to have the faintest idea how to cook in the first place.If you dump scrambled eggs into a dry non-stick pan of any make or model, they\'re going to stick. And probably burn. Every single YouTube review tries the ""egg test"" by putting an egg into a hot, dry pan and guess what happens? If you dump frozen ravioli into a dry non-stick pan, they aren\'t going to thaw, much less cook, and they\'ll have scorch marks. If you try to make fried rice in a non-stick wok but don\'t use a drop of oil, the rice is going to stick and burn. If I tune into your HexClad product review and you tell me that you had to go to the store to buy vegetable oil to season the pans because you don\'t normally use any in your cooking, I\'m going to turn that video right off.So here\'s the deal: Are HexClad non-stick pans? Yes. And also no. They are hybrid cookware. But they are unique hybrid cookware unlike any I\'ve owned or tried. Must you use some oil in your cooking? 100% yes. It\'s actually in the instruction sheet that comes with the pans. Also, it\'s proper technique. How else are you going to ensure proper heat transfer to the food? Again, think about what you\'re buying here: hybrid cookware. A hybrid of what? A hybrid of non-stick cookware, which, no matter the brand, still will require some kind of oil or fat to be properly non-stick, and of stainless steel cookware, which most definitely requires oil or fat to be non-stick.The bottom line on this whole ""they aren\'t non-stick"" nonsense is that they most certainly are. When you want them to be. When you use proper cooking techniques.Now, how did they work out for me? I\'m not a chef. I\'m a home cook. But I like to think I\'m an above average home cook. Two of my good friends are foodies. One of them actually is a chef. The other is a skilled home cook and recently purchased a set of HexClad, which he really likes. We often cook and eat together.First test, after following the seasoning instructions, was with the 12"" pan. I made sichuan chicken using boneless, skinless chicken thighs. While skeptical at first, I heated the pan on medium low as instructed, thinking no way is this going to be hot enough. With a little oil in the pan once it came up to temperature (within 2 minutes at that), the chicken cooked and even browned. Developed a nice sear on the outside. Beautiful, gorgeous color. And yet, when turning the meat it released from the pan with zero resistance and no residue left stuck on the pan surface. Removing the chicken, I added a tbsp more oil and in went the peppers and onion. Again, a gorgeous result. Nice searing and no sticking. Added the meat back, added sauce, and the same meal I had prepared the night before in my quality non-stick skillet actually looked far more appetizing. And it was delicious. I dare say, even better due to the increased Maillard reaction over standard non-stick pans. Clean up entailed a wet sponge and a gentle wipe and rinse and it was clean. Nothing stuck. No discoloration. Soap and water finish.After enjoying my meal, I just had to know if the pans were going to pass the test that would make them a keeper for me: the French Omelette test. So I heated up the 10"" pan, scrambled and seasoned three eggs, and threw a knob of butter into the pan. Medium low heat was plenty enough to get the job done. I worked quickly, keeping the eggs moving to avoid forming large curds. Once nearly set, I began rolling. The egg came away from the pan without a single stick, and without even the need to add more butter to release it as I would in my regular non-stick pans. Perfect, soft, yellow (not browned), creamy French Omelette. Clean up was a non-event. Aside from a bit of butter there wasn\'t anything for the soap, water, and sponge to remove. This test sealed the deal for me.I have other decent pans: All-Clad D3 12"" and 10"" pans, and three non-stick Oxo 8"", 10"", and 12"" pans (top rated by America\'s Test Kitchen). The All-Clads can work okay, but they were mostly a disappointment. They take too long to heat up, the heat dissipates quickly when food is added, and they have cold spots around the outside where there isn\'t direct flame. The Oxo pans are actually pretty great, but they have rubber handles which can\'t go into the oven, and even medium heat just isn\'t hot enough. Not the pan\'s fault, but you\'ll never get a sear on a non-stick surface. My goal here was to have ONE set of pans that could get proper searing, could be used in the oven, and still have non-stick properties. I have achieved that goal with the HexClad pans. My All-Clad and Oxo pans will be gifted to someone. I have no need for them anymore.Handles: Nice, fat handles on the HexClad that don\'t turn in your hands or get hot. The worst thing about the All-Clad D3\'s are the handles. I have nearly dumped the contents of both pans when tossing as the handles rotated in my palm. They are the absolute worst. I absolutely LOVE the HexClad handles.Lids: Every HexClad pan came with a nice, glass lid that fits perfectly, and has a steam vent. All-Clad? Because my D3 set didn\'t come with lids initially, All-Clad doesn\'t and won\'t sell them separately. I called All-Clad when I got them and asked if they\'d sell me some lids and they basically told me to go pound sand. They were actually rude and dismissive.Heat distribution: As mentioned, the All-Clad D3\'s didn\'t evenly distribute the heat to the outsides of the pan surface that weren\'t directly over flame, nor did they keep the heat when food was added. Even cranking the flame up to high was never enough to get a good sear. Not so with the HexClad. I was sure that the warning to not heat them above medium had something to do with the non-stick surface (and it might), but it\'s just not necessary to go any higher. The outsides of the pan are just as hot as the middle and they sear so well, keeping their heat even as food is added. They perform almost like carbon steel or cast iron in this regard.Non-stick: Covered this, but it bears repeating that these actually are non-stick when used properly.Appearance: They\'re gorgeous, aren\'t they? My friend\'s set has no discoloration after several months of daily, hard use, and he\'s never had to use Barkeeper\'s Friend or any scouring. They are absolutely stunning under the LED cook lights of my hood. Prettier by far than the All-Clad.I\'ve ordered the 2, 3, and 8 QT pot set, which arrives tomorrow, and expect to be equally happy if these pans are any indication. I also have a 10"" wok arriving next week for my near daily stir fries. At some point, I may also add a 1 QT pot and 7 QT deep saute.The bottom line is that these pans aren\'t going to miraculously make you cook better. But they WILL reward good technique with superior results. I was skeptical coming into this that I wouldn\'t like them nearly as much as what I already had but any hesitation is gone.

I have looked at this cookware before and have seen a few advertisements on it. In the past, I hesitated trying it since, in most of the pictures and videos, it looks like it has a bumpy or rough interior. When I saw the 7-quart hybrid sauce pan, I decided I had to try it to replace a 7-quart Staub Dutch oven that I have. I was so impressed by this sauce pan, I decided to buy the 12-piece set of this cookware. This set was shipped in two boxes. One box include the 6-piece pot set with lids ( 2 and 3 quart pots and 8 quart stock pot), and the other box included the 6-piece frying pan set with lids (8, 10, and 12 inch frying pans with lids).I cook quite a lot and have quit a lot of cookware of various types and brands, including Staub, Le Creuset, cast iron, , Tramontina, carbon steel, Calphalon stainless steel, and Ninja Premium cookware. In most of these, I have complete, or almost complete, sets of every piece available in each type of cookware. Each of these has their pros and cons, and all are very non-stick aside from cast iron and carbon steel that must be well seasoned.Since this review is for the HexClad cookware, I will not get into the pros and cons of each type of cookware, but will compare the HexClad cookware to some of them and let you know why I prefer this cookware over some of the others.It should be noted that it is suggested to wash and season the cookware with vegetable oil before using. I used Crisco shortening which I also use on my cast iron pans. When I seasoned the pans, the oil was completely absorbed. After the initial seasoning, these pans should not need to be seasoned again even when cleaned with soap and water. Cast iron and carbon steel pans should be seasoned after every use.So, what do I like about this cookware as compared to the other cookware I have?1 - Cast iron, and enameled cast iron is very heavy and must be seasoned after every use to maintain it. This cookware does not required seasoning after it is done initially. Carbon steel is not as heavy, but must also be seasoned after every use.2 - Stainless steel cookware needs to be cleaned very time with Bar Keeper's Friend to keep it clean and shiny. The HexClad cookware does have stainless steel on the exterior, but is easier to keep looking shiny since cooking is not done on it. Wash and dry works.3 - Most of the cookware mentioned above can be relatively nonstick when used and seasoned properly and after learning how to use it. Stainless cookware can be more challenging since temperature and what you cook can be issues. Cast iron, carbon steel, and even enameled cookware depends on persistent seasoning after every use aside from the Ninja Premium cookware that maintains a nonstick, easy to clean surface as does the HexClad cookware. Other than Tramontina cookware, the nonstick surfaces of most are durable.4 - As for weight, the cast iron and enameled cast iron (Staub and Le Creuset) are the heaviest, carbon steel comes in second, and HexClad and Ninja are about the same.5- The warranty for HexClad is lifetime vs. the Ninja warranty that is 5-10 year depending on whether you register cookware on the Ninja website. For the HexClad cookware, you must save your purchase receipt.This is all of the differences I can think of for now. If I think of more, I will add them. For now, I am impressed with the HexClad cookware, but I will not likely eliminate much of the cookware I already have. As mentioned previously, each has their own benefits. I may eventually decide to eliminate some of the heavier cookware as it is more difficult to use. I may also eliminate cookware that requires more maintenance.I will update this review if my opinion changes.

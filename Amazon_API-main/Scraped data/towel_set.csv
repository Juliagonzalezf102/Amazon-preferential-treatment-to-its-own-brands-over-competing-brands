The towels arrived vacuum packed, and I was somewhat nervous as to whether or not they would fluff-up after being washed with soap and fabric softener. You should know that the water in the washing machine was the color of claret wine. Strangely, the bath towels fluffed better than the hand towels or the washcloths. They were still on the thin side, nevertheless. When dried, there was a huge amount of lint (perhaps 1-inch thick) in the dryer. In evaluating the absorbency, it was moderate. All in all, I decided to go ahead with purchasing more towels since they were quite reasonable. Be aware that if you decide--as I did--that you would chance more towel purchases, the price will go up significantly. Frankly, I felt duped!Addendum: After three washes, the wash water is now only the color of pink lemonade. It seems that the bath towels and hand towels are decent quality--reasonably thick and fluffy--but the washcloths are stiff and thin. The dryer is still coated with an inch of lint. Keep in mind that I only purchased one set of towels.Addendum #2 (the last one): I think that I have isolated the excessive lint problem. The bath and hand towels are of decent quality. On the other hand, the stiff, thin washcloths--that seem as though they are made of different material, but the same dye lot--are visibly losing the fibers and getting slight bald patches.

Advertised at 27x54"" (1458 sq/in or 0.94 sq/meters). Actual measurement was 26""x50.5"" (1313 sq/in or 0.84 sq/meters) before first drying. That\'s a big deal to me, and more than 10% smaller AREA than advertised. Just charge 10% more, and give me what I ordered, please... No shrinkage from low heat drying. Some fade in the color despite being washed in cold water with vinegar, and the towels are no longer quite ""navy"" but are a pretty deep blue. They can look a little purplish under some lighting, but that\'s likely the type of light you use. Measured towel weights about 535-540 grams. For the advertised dimensions, it works out to about 575 GSM or the true (smaller than advertised) actual dimensions 640 GSM. If you\'re expecting to get what you paid for, look elsewhere. After laundering and soaking the towels, the saturated weight of the towel was 2220g or about 4.1:1 for water retention, which you\'ll see is middle of the pack of the old towels I compared it to.I compared the American Soft Linen towel to an old Target brand Fieldcrest Luxury (Made in India) 27""x56"" towel which after 10+ years of use was still 27""x55.5"" The Fieldcrest weighed 709g or about 725 GSM, and it feels more like a true luxury towel. Noticeably thicker and denser. Fully soaked, then formed into a ball and squeezed, the Fieldcrest saturated weight was 2615g. A ratio of 3.7:1 for water weight retention. As is typical with high GSM towels, absorbency isn\'t quite as good as towels in the 600 GSM area.I also compared the American Soft Linen to an old Linens \'N Things (Made in the U.S.A.) mid-grade towel. 27""x54"" The edges of the towel showed no shrinkage after 15+ years, however, the decorative banding had shrunk a little bit. You can really tell how worn out the LNT towel is compared to the very fluffy soft, new American Soft Linen towel, but the towels feel sort of similar in weight/density. The LNT towel weighed 595g or about 630 GSM. Fully soaked, then squeezed, the LNT saturated weight was 2,634g for a ratio of 4.4:1 for water weight retention, the best of the 3.Final thoughts: I chose American Soft Linen because of the reviews, the price, and looking into the company which imports products from Turkey, rather than China as I like to see more global manufacturing source options. The American Soft Linen Luxury towels had an actual 640 GSM rating which is a bit better than expected; however, they were 10% smaller than the advertised size (this was across all 3 sets I ordered in different colors). The towels feel quite soft, and they seem decently absorbent. The towels survived their first laundry cycle with no pulls or loose strings and they seem well made, but expect ""navy"" to fade some. These towels are a tick lighter than true luxury towels, and they\'re very fluffy once properly laundered which makes them feel lighter still. So if you want denser, heavy feeling towels, you will not be pleased with these. Overall, I\'m disappointed because these towels are substantially smaller than advertised, but at least they are significantly less expensive than luxury towels at the big box store, and they feel like they\'ll hold up and work well. If they were the correct size, I\'d give this 4 stars.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 13, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Glad I made the purchase.', 'author': 'Sarah', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""Possibly like others, I'm the sort of person who, when looking for something on Amazon, I'll buy the item which has the most reviews, thinking you can't go wrong with something that's clearly pleased thousands of others above a plethora of other options. And, thus, I hardly ever check said reviews. Seeing that the product(s) have more reviews than any other listed item is enough to sell me on it.It's sometimes only after I've placed my order & it's possibly even shipped that I bother to check what people are saying about the item, just out of curiosity. Which is what I did with the towels & washcloths I ordered here. And I panicked when I saw all the negative reviews about the extreme amounts of lint these items produce in washers, dryers, & upon other items, as well as the people using them. It was discerning to read that people were even having to empty their lint traps multiple times during a cycle due to it. Or, that they were having to clean out their washers, because it was stuck everywhere inside.But I couldn't cancel my order because they were already on their way to me by this point. So I said I'd give them a shot. Wash them, dry them, & try them. If I was unhappy, I'd simply return them & start looking elsewhere.I'm glad I didn't just immediately return them as soon as the box arrived. I might be one of few, but these towels & washcloths have caused me 0 issues. I don't know that it matters, but for reference, we have a Maytag 3000 Series matching set of washer & dryer. In terms of water: we have well water without a water softener, but we of course have a filter. So, the water could make a difference. Ours doesn't have a bunch of chemicals like fluoride & chlorine, unlike city water.When I washed them (on their own, I might add, since I was already paranoid about a mess—didn't want to be picking lint off clothing later if I could avoid it; I have enough on my plate), I put in only Tide Original liquid detergent. No fabric softener, no scent beads. Nothing fancy. Once the cycle was done, there was thankfully no lint in the washer. So, I then put everything into the dryer, forgoing including a dryer sheet.(You might wonder why I used only the detergent when washing. I read reviews on here, & in an article that when you get new towels & do your first wash or two, to not use fabric softener or dryer sheets, as it can make the issue of lint worse.)I checked the lint trap three times during the drying cycle, as I was afraid that it'd get full multiple times as the dryer ran. Instead, it was full about three-fourths of the way through, so I emptied it. When I went to retrieve the laundry about 15 minutes later once it was done, the trap was still empty.I did include a picture of how much lint my dryer collected during the cycle, with the base of a wire hanger underneath for reference. In terms of how thick the lint was, I'd say it's about how much our dryer accumulates after perhaps 2 cycles. So not bad at all. And you have to remember that these items are brand new. Something is going to come off.Then came the big test: time to shake out a towel & a washcloth, & see how much of a mess they make. So I opened our back door & stepped out, as I didn't want it all over the laundry room, & I shook a towel first, then a washcloth, as hard as I could. And I was shocked! Only a couple tiny strings came off the towel. That's it. No lint from either. No strings even from the washcloth.So I'm pleased in there being 0 mess.I did, a couple days later, have enough laundry to do another load. So, I put another towel & washcloth in, & used fabric softener this time, as well as a dryer sheet in the dryer. Once again, no problems. No lint.Onto size: I've also seen reviews of people complaining that either in the packaging or after washing & drying, the towels are/become flat. I didn't experience that. I've included pictures of the towels & washcloths both measured & compared to ones we've been using. For the washcloth: the grey one lying next to the white one I bought is one of my favorite washcloths that we have. I actually thought it was large, compared to many of our other ones! Imagine my surprise.Finally, I came to the most important test: how do they hold up when being used for their actual purposes? The washcloth was just fine in the shower. It cleaned me like it was supposed to & suds-upped easily, without any lint getting all over. The towel dried me just as well as our old ones, & no lint ended up all over the floor or shower.All in all, I have no reason to be upset with my purchases. I know they're pricey, but I feel they were worth it. I was actually thinking of—so long as I liked the towels—ordering another set or two. Due to how large they are, however, I don't think they'd even fit where I'd need them to (this is not a complaint)! Same for the washcloths. I ordered 5 packs, which would give me 20, but I then looked & found another color or two that I'd like to have, but due to how fluffy they are, I don't know that they'd all fit in the bin I intend to get from Target to place them all in.I won't say that if you're skeptical to just buy them & that you won't be regretful. You could end up like the others that have dealt with the horrible lint problem. But, remember if you take a chance on them, that Amazon has a good return policy (imo). So you can always send them back & get a refund.I'm just glad I won't have to go through that hassle & that they've worked out how I hoped they would!

I purchased this set in Coral and I couldn’t be happier. The color is more of a burnished coral, toned down from some of the bright Coral colors you have probably seen on Amazon. This set consists of 2 bath towels, 2 hand towels and 2 wash cloths. I like that the hand towel dries rather quickly because I am always washing my hands and the hand towels I’ve had previously were always very damp and I had to use other towels. The face cloths are not the thick ones that you can’t use to clean your ears. The bath towel dries a lot quicker if you spread it out on a long towel bar. They are of medium weight and not too thick which is perfect for me. I have the thick, plush spa-type towels that take forever to dry, are heavy and more so when they absorb water. They also get cold, wet spots which are most uncomfortable. These towels have none of those issues. I was able to dry myself off, wipe down shower walls and floor plus shower curtain all with the same bath towel. Talk about high absorbtion!! Given the surprising price of this set, I think they are worth a lot more. The hems at the ends are double stitched and by all appearances, appear to be quality towels. They wash beautifully with no run of color. The dryer had a lot of lint with the first time drying and less in the second round of drying and a lot less with the third time and it appears to me, there will be even less lint as time goes by. A word of caution here and that is to not use fabric softener on towels. They coat the cotton fibers with PDMS (dimethicone) which is a silicone polymer oil that destroys absorbment properties and makes the towels stiff and scratchy. This happened to me in the past before I discovered this was the reason for loss of softness, absorbency and stiffness in towels. This is why manufacturers state on their labels not to use fabric softeners when washing and drying towels. Once you eliminate fabric softeners, you will notice and feel a difference. The only request I have for this company is to produce more colors like Ivory, Peach, a creamy Pink and a variety of colors you see from other companies on Amazon.

My old ones are a nationally well-known brand that were sold by a major mid-range department store that has survived for 120+ years, and still has anchor stores in many mega malls across the country. I wanted to find similar quality towels in new colors. Boy, did I learn a lot about today\'s towel industry! I bought these towels thinking that they would be as good as my old towels that were considered ""average"" quality back then. These towels simply are no match for my old ""average"" towels. These towels are rather flimsy and light weight. And they aren\'t very absorbent. When you use one of these towels to wipe up water splashed on the counter, it will leave water streaks behind. It takes 2 or 3 passes to wipe all the water up.I learned that towels are rated by GSM, ""grams per square meter"". The towel industry rates towels as: 300 - 400 GSM (lightweight, thinner); 400 - 600 GSM (medium to higher weight, soft and absorbent); or 700 - 900 GSM (highest, heavy weight, luxury towels). They say these towels are rated 560. I think these towels are ok if you have kids and just want lighter weight towels to wash more often. I found this company\'s hand towels and face clothes to be fine with their lighter weight . But I found their bath towels to be not so great. As I said, they are sort of flimsy and don\'t feel very substantial. I am going to keep the hand towels and face clothes, but I have already purchased higher rated, luxury bath towels. They basically match what in the old days would be considered to be an ""average"" bath towel. And with the mega sales on towels these days, they didn\'t cost me that much more. I am going to donate these bath towels to charity.In summary, these days one really needs to think more about what they want in a bath towel before purchasing. If you just want an inexpensive towel, this brand is fine. But if you want something more luxurious, these towels are not heavier, luxurious towels.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 21, 2024', 'is_verified': True}]"

Amazon told us to keep them rather ship them back due to damage to them, so after 6 months, I wanted to give a further update. For what we are using them for, to soak up water and pee puddles from our dogs, they are complete junk as they barely absorb any liquid messes on the floor; all they do is smear the wet mess around as they don't absorb like other towels do. After only a few washes, the towels would completely fall apart, and don't even attempt to use bleach in the wash, as it causes the towel to start to fray or has put holes in it. Also, the towels fray very easily after being washed and we have even found what we can only describe as wirey thin plastic things in the towels that we have no idea where they are coming from except from the material that these cheap towels are made of.===Initial review only after a few weeks:We bought these with the intent for our dogs for them to be used to soak up water or pee messes around the house in the tile and slate floor rooms, however, they fail to soak up the water or pee, thus leaving a lot of liquid still on the floor.

Now although I was shocked by that I must say that I do like these towels I washed them once in the washer and hung dried them (I also wanted to mention that these dry really nicely outside in a shaded but warm area and don't get hard like some towels can) and there was no shedding like with cotton towels. These are thin and don't feel like thick bath towels but they're extremely absorbent. Now be aware that if you buy these towels they do not glide across your skin like cotton, it's more of a tap to dry method that works with these. These towels are extremely soft and have a lovely color that hasn't faded in several washes so far. I would definitely recommend these towels just make sure you're aware of the material unlike me, again I'm not unhappy with my purchase I'm actually quite happy and surprised at how much I like these.

So so so soft. If you’re looking for an exfoliating bath towel, this isn’t it. I was super happy wrapping my baby in these towels after a bath.- beautiful colors- decent priceCons:- 3/6 of us decided that the towels were “too soft”. My husband refuses to use them (see next point)- it is because they are so soft that they’re not entirely absorbent, I find I have to blot (press and hold) the water off my body vs the ‘running the towel over my skin’ that I’m used to with previous towels.- don’t ask me how….. and it’s happened to about 80% of rmy towels…. They smell like DORITOS. even fresh out of the dryer, they distinctly smell like Doritos. We’re not huge fans of Doritos in this house (sunchips house) but about six months out, almost every towel reeked. I wash all of my towels equally, and nothing else in my laundry has this smell, only these towels. I’ve found that I have to soak them in a pine-sol solution in the wash to keep the smell at bay.As of today, we’re using different towels, which is a bummer because I was all for the pros and less caring about the cons until the smell just couldn’t be taken anymore.Again, I wouldn’t even comment if the rest of my laundry had a funky smell. But it is, literally, just these towels. The hand towels, the bath towels, the washcloths – all of them, and only them, have the smell. :(Just an fyi- I bet these would make great guest towels if you don’t have so much company that you need to launder them frequently.

The color I ordered is blue. It is a darker blue gray color tone and not a true sky blue tone which is fine and since I have a blue tile with different hints of blue color tones with in its pattern and the color blue of these towels match perfectly. It says on the directions to machine wash and machine dry before use. So I just finished taking these towels out of the dryer, I did use a fabric dryer sheet when drying the towels in the machine. The towels fluffed up nicely, they are nice and soft. I saw in some reviews that others experienced lint and shedding with their towels but I did not experience any lint or shedding with these blue towels, I'm wondering that if perhaps its because I used a fabric dryer sheet when drying the towels kept the towels lint and shedding free? I did not experience any of those issues with my blue towels or perhaps the blue ones are different then other colors? I only have the blue color towels and I can only comment on these. I have used them today and I am very happy with the fluffiness and thickness of these towels, and still so far it's lint free and no shedding. I tried shaking the towel, rubbing the towel on my face and hands, and even on my clothes and I even checked my sink and rubbed a tissue along the sink to see if any shedding or fabric debris would be on it but nothing, its clean with no lint and no shedding so I was extremely happy. The only issue I had with the towels was that in different rooms of my house the lighting is different making the texture of the towel look different, so in rooms that the lighting is extremely bright the texture of the towel does not look as soft or as nice but even though they are very soft it looked different in different light settings, in my bathroom the lighting is different and the towels looked perfect and even looked soft, I'm not sure why in my kitchen lighting the towels appear different. So I will not be using these towels as guest towels because of the lighting making the appearance of the towel in my guest bathroom look different in texture it made them appear looking not soft even though they feel soft it still looked different. Since I am using these towels in my bathroom and the lighting is different there they look soft and beautiful in my bathroom lighting, they work perfectly and look soft and pretty. I can't comment on durability because I have only used these towels once and so far I am happy. I got them on sale and I plan on using them as everyday towels.

The Walmart towels were extremely thick with extra long loops and a very dense weave and even after over 10 years of heavy use and machine washing, they are still thick, but no longer feel soft as they used to and do not look good. I am planning to retire these and use for doggie baths.I am comparing the Hawmam towels to the Walmart ones. My first impression of the Hawmam brand was the packaging. The towels were not fluffy and the package stated that was normal and to launder them and they would fluff up. I did machine wash and dry low heat and they did fluff up but I noticed the loops are not very dense and that contributed to towel drying faster than the Walmart towels. There is a noticeable lack of density of loops--yet the total weight of the towel is higher than expected given the less dense looping. The second thing I noticed is that 3 of my bath towels had long threads hanging. Do not pull on these because I did that to one and it pulled a whole section of looping out. It was very narrow but noticeable. What you should do with these towels is see if you can exchange or return them. I decided to keep mine so what I recommend doing with loose threads if you find them is cut them in half, tie the two half pieces in a surgeons knot and do it again, then snip any excess, but not the knot. Another bath towel arrived with one of these sections already apparent on the towel, without any abuse by me. I also had several hand towels and a washcloth that had loose long threads and I texted photos of all these imperfections to the number that they give you inside each package. The company politely asks for feedback on their towels after using them. They are nice towels overall. Theyre not as fluffy and dense as I was expecting, but theyre good enough that I chose to keep them. The Walmart towels are thicker and less flexible, take a long time to dry, are very heavy when theyre wet. Hawman is nice fluffy towel with shorter less dense loops, dries fast in dryer on low temperture!, soft on the skin, dried my skin and hair well and fast. I would not categorize these towels as luxury. Why? Because in my mind, a luxury towel will have longer more dense loops. I don\'t expect to see loose long threads and other issues with a luxury class towel. However, all things considered, they still seem to be nice enough for home use. I will be looking for a different brand for ""company\'s coming"" towels. Ive attached photos. I will update my review if I notice more issues as time passes and its used and laundered more. Would have given these 4 stars for value except there was too many issues in the sets I bought.

We\'ve used and washed/dried them twice since as well (we use unscented Persil detergent.) I didn\'t see excessive lint or shedding at all -- just normal, like old towels. They haven\'t torn or frayed. I dry my face on them and get no residue.They are nice and soft, and very absorbent. I do use a cup of vinegar in a Downy ball that releases during the double-rinse cycle of my HE top-loading machine. (I find that double-rinsing helps keep my towels soft, and helps prevent itchy skin too.) I also use 1 sheet of unscented softener in my LOW-temperature dryer. They seem to dry a bit faster than my heavier cotton towels, so 1 low cycle is all that\'s required for us -- about an hour. (They are a bit lighter in weight than classic cotton towels. But there is no suspicious lack of absorption from synthetic polyester. They are normal thickness, not thin.) I also have not seen any color-bleeding onto our clothes, but I have not washed them with whites. No uneven fading either so far.These are nice and huge. My 6\'6"" husband loves them. I will be ordering 4 more regular towels for the normal sized beings in the house. These are too long to wrap my hair with.The color is a nice, dark indigo-navy -- dark purplish blue -- Seahawks blue. I love it. They pair well with white, or silver-grey, or tan, or even chartreuse -- Seahawks green.My husband does not like that he has to dry them on low, and wash them in cold water without bleach. He tends to get really rough when washing towels, motivated by germaphobia. The solution to that is to use 1/4 cup of Pinesol or Lysol in the wash instead of bleach (1/2 cup for old-school non-HE top loaders.) The strong scent will disappear when they dry. His bleach addiction disintegrated our white cotton towels, along with high-temperature drying. That is why I got the dark color -- he doesn\'t get obsessed with getting them sparkling white anymore. Our dryer gets extremely hot so I would say these towels can stand up to Medium temperature in most household dryers, if you want extra germ-killing-power. Ours kills germs even on low for an hour (above 140F.)

They lacked the plush, luxurious feel that I was hoping for in a towel set. I found them to be quite rough and not very comfortable to use.**Quality Questions (2/5):** The quality of the towels left much to be desired. After just a few uses and washes, I noticed signs of wear and tear, with threads starting to fray. This lack of durability is a significant downside.**Poor Absorbency (2/5):** The primary purpose of towels is to absorb moisture, and these towels didn\'t do a great job in that department. They left me feeling not quite dry after use, which defeats the purpose of having towels.**Inconsistent Color (2/5):** The color of the towels appeared inconsistent across the set. Some towels seemed slightly faded, while others were brighter.

These towels are an absolute game-changer when it comes to comfort, absorbency, and overall quality.First and foremost, the softness of these towels is simply unmatched. The microfiber material used in their construction feels incredibly gentle against the skin, providing a luxurious experience every time I use them. It's like wrapping myself in a cloud of comfort after an intense workout session.One of the standout features of these towels is their exceptional absorbency. Despite their lightweight nature, they effortlessly soak up moisture, leaving my skin feeling dry and refreshed. Whether it's sweat from a tough gym session or water from a post-workout shower, these towels quickly and efficiently do their job, allowing me to proceed with my day without any discomfort.Durability is another area where these towels shine. Even after several washes, they have maintained their softness and remained in excellent condition. The hemming is impeccably done, ensuring the towels withstand regular use without fraying or unraveling. I truly appreciate the attention to detail and craftsmanship put into their design.The 16x28-inch size is perfect for my needs, providing ample coverage and convenience. Additionally, the light grey color is elegant and versatile, complementing any bathroom decor or workout environment.Lastly, the fact that this set comes with six towels is a fantastic value for the price. It allows me to have multiple towels readily available for my workouts, ensuring I always have a fresh and clean towel at hand. Plus, the limited-time deal made this purchase even more irresistible.In conclusion, the TENSTARS Silk Hemming Hand Towels have become an indispensable part of my workout routine.

Climate change is REAL people! Which means my house is a million times more humid than it ever was before. Consequently, thick towels never dry and always smell like mildew, even when clean. These guys are thin enough that they air dry well, so no dampness or mildew smell. I guess I'm changing my expectations along with time changing things (like the damn weather).

Anytime i find a towel that is soft or that i would like to try, they are way over priced. I need a ton of washcloths, hand towels and bath towels because there are 3 adults living in my house and I don\'t like to spend a ton of money on them. In the past i have and they turned out to be the worst towels ever.They were very soft right out of the package...i wanted to hurry up and buy more but, waited until i knew for sure they would be as good as all the reviews said.I did as instructed ""wash before use, alone"", ( I also ran them through 2 cycles to rid of all the loose threads/fibers ) used no fabric softener because i read that over time, it breaks down the towel fibers and eventually, they will feel stiff and hard. Which explains my stiff scratchy towels in the past.Out of the dryer they were even better than before. The bath towel size is great, large enough for a man and the wash cloths are just the right size and amazing.The best quality towel i have ever purchased, hands down. They are made in Turkey which is probably why. Anything made in CHINA is always cheaper but certain to be junk and not long lasting.I foresee these being worth the price of the additional ones i will buy and completely get rid of all of the old ones i have been hanging onto all these years.I will be buying at least 2 of the bath sheets for the needs of the other humans that live in my house. I am extremely happy with these, i love the light grey color option because i am remodeling my bathroom and grey and white is the color scheme.All around 2 thumbs up, 5 stars, i would even say Hotel quality.

These are softer/fluffier than the JML towels, and the JML towels don't dry my body as well as these do.These towels are microfiber, and not the same as cotton towels. If you are expecting the same experience as cotton, it is not going to happen with microfiber. Here are some of the differences:- Microfiber towels (all of them) tend to 'roll' a bit (bunch up) in your hand when you are drying off. All of them do this and you have to adjust your drying technique or how you hold the towel. It is not a difficult skill to learn.- They don't dry your body as bone-dry as really excellent cotton towels, but if you use fabric softener on your cotton towels, these will dry about the same.- After use or washing, they dry in minutes. Like, less than 20 minutes in my dry climate.- You can't put them in the dryer except air dry, you can't wash them in hot water- You can't use bleach on them, so if you are going to blot up that red wine spill on your carpet, don't do it with these.- These have maintained their fluffiness pretty well, but I never wash in hot or hot dry them- They are waaaaaay easier to launder than regular towels. I actually just wash these with my regular clothes (t-shrits, wash/wear work shirts, etc.) and have had no catastrophic laundry incidents to date.- I've hung these on the line without air-drying in the dryer and they are not as fluffy unless you shake vigorously. The JML-style of microfiber towels might be better if you don't have a dryer.- I've also hand-laundered these (hand-wash with a wringer or spinner) and they are sooooo much easier to deal with than cotton towels.

Regular towels are so hard on your hair when it is wet and brittle, so I wanted to try microfiber. Here are my thoughts on this:These are amazing when I wrap my hair in them. It is half way dry when I take it off and greatly reduces my blow dry time, saving heat damage on your hair. I do NOT have curly hair, and I have wondered how it will work with curly hair and if it will leave you a little frizzy... I can\'t speak to that but do see it as a potential \'thing\'.For the body. The first time I used it, I hated it. I am used to moving a towel over my skin to dry it. Well, these don\'t slide!! But they absorb the moisture FAST. You basically just need to blot yourself and you are dry and ready to put on lotion or clothes or whatever you do when you are dry after the shower. An unexpected bonus: Sometimes in the winter I dread getting out of the shower. It is so cold and the shower was so nice and warm, then you turn it off, ""dry"" yourself and get out...and freeze. These get you so dry that I haven\'t really noticed being cold after a winter shower, so that has been nice.So, if you haven\'t used a microfiber towel on yourself before, it may take a tiny bit of getting used to, but even my husband has been using these without complaint (so that must mean he likes it!).

Shopping for new towels after many, many years, the only shade of a color I was searching for, came up in the Pinzon line, which is the Amazon brand. Thought about ordering the towels that looked a shade or two off, as they were the name brands we had always purchased, when one of the big mall stores had a sale. It is difficult for both of us to go shopping at stores and malls as my better half has health problems, and I have become totally disabled. So, just going out to shop, is in our past. I have kept the household and us, running smoothly by shopping at Anazon, thus far. But this nagging feeling I had about changing the richness of the color scheme we have set ourselves up for in a bathroom that was redone, in preparation for the last time in our lives, to redecorate had me worried. They LOOKED nice and fluffy, and MOST towels are very absorbent. But I have also seen towels in store advertisements that, once in the store, the product looks and feels, NOT as advertised. At times, it resembled nothing like the pictures and descriptions. So, after discussing it with my other half, we decided to ""take a leap"", for once and go with Pinzon, Amazon\'s brand. I admit I worried about authenticity of both color and quality many times, as I awaited the delivery. Oh my! When they came, was I surprized! Not only did they all match perfectly, the QUALITY was beyond my expectations! They are thick, beautiful towels that are fluffy, wash beautifully and are so soft! On top of that, the color scheme matched perfectly! My other half even remarked about these towels, and he rarely says anything about a product, unless he does not like it. So THAT in itself was a bonus. I have always opted for the ""other"" brand when choosing what to purchase on Amazon. After this experience, I will be ordering Pinzon towels for another bathroom, once we are done re-doing things like paint and flooring. They happen to have another shade of a color, that will match another bath perfectly. From now on, I won\'t be as rigid as to my choices of what we have liked and worked for us before.

I've never gotten good or bad feedback from the recipients but I was looking for a new set for my home and liked the design and color choices. I was worried because I saw a lot of bad reviews about them falling apart in the wash.I selected the moss color. When I got them in the color was just too dark for what I was looking for and they felt scratchy so they sat unopened for the longest time. I ended up going to a local store and getting what I wanted in a thicker but cheaper towel. When I brought the new ones home from the store I put them in their first wash with a cup of white vinegar and nothing else and then dried them without any softener. I was in love and very happy with my towels until... I decided to just go ahead and wash the Pinzon set in white vinegar and no softener.I begrudgingly have to admit I was wrong and now my husband has claimed them for himself. The ones I bought locally are thick and soft but they more push the water around your skin than absorb. I don't mind because I like large and soft towels especially to wrap my hair in. The Pinzon towels came out great from that first wash and softened up well. The difference is that they are a brisk towel that dry your hair and body fast. Very no nonsense which appeals to my husband.I've held off reviewing because I wanted to have a ton of washes in to be able to securely review the quality. I originally purchased the towel on right around Christmas, it's now February 25th. There's not been one busted seam, no picks, no holes, no tears and no fading so far. I typically cram as many clothes into my washer as it can hold which to no end annoys my husband who is more of the type to fill it 3/4s of the way full. We have front loaders, not sure if that would make a difference. I will come back in a few months if anything changes but so far so good.

Researched ""washing new towels"" and ended up washing them in warm water with detergent and white vinegar then detergent and baking soda. This is supposed to set the color and accelerate removing the coating that is put on new towels (which interferes with absorbency). I did this 4 times (drying in dryer after each wash). This process did seem to get rid of the coating and lint faster. BUT, the difference in the amount of lint generated by the moss set and the Wedgwood set was tremendous! The moss set shed barely a handful of lint thru the process but the Wedgwood set shed at least 6-7 large handfuls of lint ! (I also bought a Pinzon 550 GSM set in coral and had the same lint nightmare!).What I like: The colors! Which match the pics pretty closely. The banding does not shrink. They are soft and absorbent (after the washings). Good quality mid weight towel.What I don\'t like: Lint!! Don\'t understand how in the world Amazon can say their towels won\'t shed much after the first wash. The coating put on the towels. One of the Wedgwood hand towels came apart at the side seam after first wash. The corner of one of the Moss bath towels was not sewn down completely.Overall: I like these mid weight towels, would purchase again and think they are priced right.I suggest Amazon should include instructions for the initial washing process of their towels (with the vinegar, wash/dry frequency, etc.). Customers would have a more favorable view of their towels if they had a more positive, quick, and less annoying experience with getting rid of the lint and increasing the towels\' absorbency.But what I REALLY wish is that some brilliant Research & Development person will think to market towels that are sold without a coating and already defuzzed!!

The 600 GSM weight seemed like a good balance of weight and price.

If you\'re used to 900 GSM spa towels yeah, they may seem thin. But I decided to give them a try.The instructions said to give them an initial wash and they will fluff up. I found that to be true. They are packed pretty tight and looked compressed right out of the bag. But after a wash and dry, they fluffed up and feel really nice.As for being ""thin"" or ""cheap"", they seem very nice to me. Personally, I don\'t like super heavy towels. Like everything else this GSM weight thing can be taken to extremes. I think there\'s a balance point between a towel that\'s easy to handle and one that feels like you\'re grabbing a rug. Also I\'ve found that the really heavy weight towels don\'t necessarily dry me off any better or faster than a mid weight towel like these.

For reference, I’m 5’8, DDD, 300lbs and I hold most of my weight in my lower half and hip area, so I usually have issues with regular towels actually completely covering me. These towels wrap around me comfortably and hit below my knee with no issue, even when started at my chest. I’ve washed them twice so far since purchasing less than a week ago and they’ve held up well washing and drying on medium heat.

They left GOBS of lint in my washing machine. They filled the lint trap in the dryer to the point that we're lucky we didn't get a dryer fire from them. I ran the dryer over and over again, cleaning out the lint trap every time. I did that for an entire day, and they never stopped filling the lint trap.End result: They have little pills of lint stuck to them. It's especially visible on the dark blue one. The hem is coming unsewn on two of them--cheaply and carelessly made.. And finally---and the worst---at the end of all that they aren't thirsty, fluffy, bath towels.

I washed themseparately, as indicated on each package. And I'm very glad that I did.The lint-trap in my dryer was FULL of the colored lint from each particular set that I had washed (alone). Each set of towels were very soft & fluffy after they finished drying withminimal shrinkage. I am very satisfied with these towels & am very thankful that they're not too heavy. I suffer from Osteo-Arthritis ofboth hands, wrists and shoulders. I consider these towels to be a real Blessing. They'resoft, absorb water well, dry quickly & look very beautiful in my bathroom. Also, the fact that each towel has 2 wash cloths is aBig Bonus for me. I use 1 wash cloth for my face & 1 wash cloth formy body; Love It. Since there are 8 pieces to each towel set, I plan towash each color alone in the future. I kinda believe that the amount of lint left, after drying, is due to the generous amount of dye used in these towels; which is a good thing to me. I do highly recommend this item.

Goslow', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""Update, bought these June 2020, it is now April 2021- These towels are holding up well, Colors have all stayed the same except the yellow has dimmed slightly but all others are same vibrant, I am actually happy the yellow slightly dimmed. No smell as I was having with the other microfiber bath towels I had purchased. These have/are working out great, I am not seeing wear or tear also which you see after many usages, so strong sturdy. I do use a detergent that has no dyes in it, I wash on cold water (microfiber does not do well in heat) and tumble dry on low, which does take longer in the dryer but worth it for these wonderful towels. Still a 5 star for these even after many months of usage.To explain where I am coming from, about 8 months ago I bought some micro-fiber towels (different than these) to try out. They were thinner, more like the microfiber you clean glasses or screens with. You can see the difference in texture on the picture with the purple towels, the lighter grey is the previous style. We got use to the blotting vs rubbing, but we loved that we could dry ourselves quickly and hang the towels vs a cotton towel, we would walk around a while with the towel wrapped around us as we were still wet and did not want to put clean cloths on until we were dry. This kept towels in bathrooms vs finding them in bedrooms or other weird places. This was awesome and we were sold on the microfiber bath towels. Due to the slimness we even changed up our bathrooms with simple hooks vs towel bars. Eight months had passed of heavy use of these towels, and using microfiber laundry soap, hang drying or no heat setting in dryer. They started to retain a smell, we tried using regular detergent thinking that might help but no they still stink.Loving the microfiber towels for the quick drying after a shower, we discussed maybe a different type of microfiber cloth (we use microfibers in a few places in the house and there are many types of microfiber textures) Our towels in our kitchen, which we bought about the same time, and get heavy use but we did buy many more of them, so it might be a rotation thing, do not have any sort of smell. So for our bath towels we decided to go with a texture similar to those. Which are these towels! We just barely had these arrive, so I will try to do an update a few months down the road, but lets get to my first impressions.Colors- oh wow the colors are amazing, We purchased the grey, yellow, green 6 pack and the Blue, brown, purple 6 pack. You get 2 of each of the colors. The grey is a bluish grey that fits almost any bathroom. The green is a sage green and yellow is more earthy so not too bright. The purple is a royal purple, it looks much lighter in description pictures, the blue is a very bold blue (we bought for the purple and brown) The brown is more of a milk chocolate color (I was hoping for a deeper brown, which I think they may have but it is with the lighter purple and blue) So the earthier (green, yellow, brown) we have in one bathroom and the bold purple, blue, grey (now this grey could have matched the earthy set, so if just getting one pack and you want an earthy feel for your bathroom, go with the yellow, green and grey set)Size- perfect even if you wanted to wrap around you, but as I said with the microfibers we just dry, hang, and get dressed, no need to wrap, but if you wanted to, yes these are 3 inches shorter than the average xl towels but with out the bulkiness it is easy to tuck in and will stay if you really want to wrap. (I use to be a wrapper so I understand the size issue, I think that is why I still get such large towels, maybe I should look into slightly smaller as these do seem over kill, yes it took me a review to realize this size thing is ingrained from years of cotton towel use)absorbency- I do have a separate hair towel, very thick hair and I do walk around with my hair in that towel for awhile so this review is just for face and body. After fully drying off (less than 1 min to do) Towel still seemed dry, but I know it took off a ton of water, it did feel slightly heavier so I know the water was in it. So great absorbency. I will say from my previous microfiber towels where you put on and blotted, this could move more like a terry or cotton towel but not quite, I guess it is half way between the two types. So if this is your first body microfiber, I would say to get use to blotting, but if you had the type we had previously, this is a welcome change as it doesn't stick as strongly to your body and you can move the towel a little to wipe vs pure blotting. Still dried my body just as quick, one swipe in each area and all water gone as with all microfibers that I have ever used. So I guess no surprise there. Our old ones you could see where they were darker (more water) to lighter (dry part of towel) This I am not sure as I can not tell it even has water in it besides the weight.Texture-very soft, and fuzzy, with these being microfiber (which grabs everything *why it grabs water off your body so well) I plan to only wash with the other body towels, not with my kitchen or dog microfiber towels.Hanging- These have their hanging tab in the middle of the long way! This so far is my only con about these towels, I personally have hooks so they can hang down fully, so I will be getting some ribbon and sewing a hook on 1 corner. If you have a towel bar in your bathroom, this would not even faze you.As I said before, our last towels got a smell that we can not get out, so this time, I bought enough to wash each towel after 2 days which is higher rotation (previous towels 7 days) so stay tuned for an update after a few months, fingers crossed that it will still be a 5 star rating. Don't forget to buy a hand towel or two that matches, I will need to do that, forgot to get a few hand towels."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States June 10, 2020', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect', 'author': 'Mars', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Good quality and easy to use.

Wells', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""These are exactly what I was hoping they would be! Thin, light, yet very absorbant. They are excellent! I'm a big guy, and even relatively expensive traditional cotton towels always left me feeling clammy after a shower, which is just annoying. I know it's possible to do better, because I have used things like super-chamoise and the like which pick up every drop of water off of the skin with the barest little swipe. I don't need that level of water absorption, but I hate feeling a sheen of water all over after drying off with a regular towel. It feels more like those towels are pushing water around than actually picking it up.I was hoping these microfiber towels would be somewhere between a cotton towel and a super-chamoise in absorption, and I was absolutely not disappointed! In my experience, if I start with drying my arms for example, by the time I finish drying my legs my arms have already finished air-drying what moisture was left over. I'm always nice and dry by the time I walk out of the bathroom now, which is exactly what I was looking for.While these towels are much more absorbent than cotton towels, they are also quite a bit thinner. They are nice and fluffy, yet thin enough to be thrown in my gym bag without any trouble. They do stretch a bit, which is kind of weird, but it hasn't caused any issues with using them, it's just different than what I'm used to.My only concern right now is because they were so inexpensive, I'm not sure how long they will last. I haven't noticed any quality issues after visually inspecting them, and after using them for several showers everything seems fine, but I haven't even sent these through the wash cycle yet so I don't know.Basically if you don't see me coming back here to complain about the quality in six months, you know they worked out fine for me.

Still really soft and no shedding in my lint trap.Gave my dog a bath the next day and these were a game changer!! She was sooo much dryer than when using a cotton towel of ANY size! And I only had to use one. I bought the pack of six in gray and am really glad I did.I used one on the floor and didn’t even need it. I kept going back over her body with the towel and it just kept on sopping up the water. Her paws were still wet and I found a couple dry spots on the towel and sure enough it was enough to do the job without busting out the extra towel.I’m very impressed so far. Now if they hold up I will be even more so but I don’t see why they won’t. The stitching seems good and if properly washed for my purposes I don’t see why I won’t have these a while.

I LOVE THEM.Then when I hang them up after showering or drying my hands, the towels feel like they are already dry, hardly any water left behind.My husband was very skeptical when I hung them up, he groaned and moaned about them being micro fiber because he has rough hands and he just knew they were going to snag on his rough skin...but they DIDN'T!!! Under his breathe he muttered that he was happy with them. LOLI love these towels so much that I have ordered us another set.We love the size of them too, large enough to reach around after you've showered and when I use the washcloth to rinse my face, I cup my hand with the washcloth in it and fill it with water to splash on my face and it holds all the water, no other washcloth has done that.

But ALWAYS make sure that you use good quality laundry detergent and softener. That makes a huuuuge difference with texture and feel in everything you wash, including towels! Noooo doubt about it. (just FYI). Plus these towels dry out a little bit quicker because they are not so darn thick. But for the most part these are sort of my ""dress up towels"" anyway (if you will), for the bathroom. Question: Am I the only one; (or is there anybody else out there) that has their old ""I don\'t care towel"" (hanging in their closet), that they use to shower...but they keep the nice ones out and generally don\'t use them? LOL ...Anyway, I think these are really nice towels. I have white, beige, and chocolate color accents in my bathroom with stone accenting with the soap dispenser, tissue box, perfume tray, and such .....that sort of gives a Greek flare without being too too much.

BTW, before I bought these towels, I bought some other unknown brand of Turkish style beach towel and they were less expensive—- but they didn’t have the one side that is terry cloth and while they worked fine for laying out in the sun and poolside, they don’t work well for the day to day post shower dry off. The Sandcloud is worth the $80 bucks but you’ll likely need another set or two.

I usually prefer towels that are predominately cotton or with a high percentage of cotton I think just because that's what I've always been used to. The problem is, that cotton towels take forever to dry. Sometimes it feels like you should have a clothes dryer in your bathroom. These towels are all polyester fiber so no cotton, also called microfiber.I like the color and design of these towels. The stripes are a nice departure from the same old solid colors you usually find in the bathroom. I like the way they are made, they have a nice hem around the edge and they even include a small hanging loop on the edge of the hem so that you can hang the towel on a hook without worrying about it falling on the floor. Instead of the fabric just being a flat tight weave like most bath/beach towels the fabric in these towels is more fluffy. Close up it almost sort of reminds me of the weave of a shaggy carpet. That profile in the fabric makes these towels a lot more absorbent than some other flat-weave synthetic towels I own. I don't like feeling as if I just wiped myself off with a piece of plastic that didn't absorb any of the water that was on me. They have avoided that with these towels and I'm pretty impressed with that. The large towels are very big. They feel huge compared to the other full-size bath towels we have, but that's fine. They're certainly a great size for the pool or beach so that's a plus. I guess the number one thing about these towels is that because they are synthetic they really do dry out a lot faster, in the dryer and just hanging there. Anyone who has reached for their towel in the shower or at the pool only to discover that it is mostly damp will appreciate that."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 15, 2024', 'is_verified': False}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Super buy', 'author': 'Jessie Z.', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I am attracted by the color.

They lasted ten years, and still do the job of drying me, however, they\'re starting to fall apart (expected after ten years).I saw the deal for these towels. I had reservations, but they were in my favorite configuration numbers (matching numbers of bath towels, hand towels, and wash cloths), and a reasonable price. What\'s the worst that could happen, they have the same lasting impression as what I bought ten years ago?They arrived promptly (I\'m still upset at the USPS guy ringing my doorbell at 6:47am, but that\'s no fault of these towels, except for the fact they were in the delivery). I opened the box to a pretty cool wrapped combo of the towels. I opened the first set and immediately said ""WOWSERS!"" Touching them was like touching the fur of a 6 week old bunny. It was impossible to not hold it up against my cheek and try to snuggle with it. I did the rule of washing them. There was the standard ""first wash"" lint, but it was less than I expected, considering the softness. And, the wash just made them softer.Their softness and absorbance is also their downfall. Using the wash cloth, I don\'t get what feels to be an abrasive exfoliation like my previous cloths gave. It\'s a lushness spreads any cleanser you use through your skin without the possibility of leaving a scratch on even the fairest of skins.When drying off, the towels absorb any excess shower water almost as instantly as the Sham-Wow guy demonstrates his product. The water is grasped into its fibers and locked away to be evaporated into the air.In all, these towels deserve 6 out of 5 stars.

The bath towels (or sheets) are large and cover a good area, but they stick to you when you try to dry off and you can't really rub yourself down with them. You almost have to pat dry instead of rubbing dry. It's literally like if you were trying to dry yourself off with a sheet. It's so awkward. And soft. The towel does an amazing job of wrapping your hair, though, and it stays wrapped and does not fall off your head, so if you're going to use it for anything, I suggest using it for that. These would also make great towels to take out to the beach and lie on or something, but I just don't know they are the best to towel off with after a shower.

They wash easily and wash well, retaining their shape and absorbency. The colors are rich and remained unchanged after two washes.They have that microfiber feel, which is perfectly fine but definitely different from what you might expect if you have only used cotton terry cloth towels. Whereas terry cloth glides over your skin, these seem to have just a bit more friction. That said, they are still softer than the average cotton towel and are more absorbent. They are also lighter in weight and dry more quickly on the rack.For the record, not all microfiber towels are the same. These are far more absorbent than my last set of towels. They appear to be well made. As with most microfiber towels, there is a sewn border around the periphery of the towels. These appear to be well seated and should last a long time.

Wash cloths are generously sized. I like them a great deal and will order more. When you consider the price of a similar towel at a major department store, these are a bargain.

They do seem to be made well, the color was spot on, and the measurements were true... but they are not the same quality as the original towels I got years ago. The reason for the decent rating? Climate change is REAL people! Which means my house is a million times more humid than it ever was before. Consequently, thick towels never dry and always smell like mildew, even when clean. These guys are thin enough that they air dry well, so no dampness or mildew smell. I guess I'm changing my expectations along with time changing things (like the damn weather).

I was looking for some nice but not overly pricey towels for a guest bathroom. I selected the Platinum color as a neutral color that could complement many decor / color styles. The towels came wrapped in plastic and did not smell coming out of the bag. They were tied together with a nice wide ribbon - slight drawback is the ribbon was branded but it was wide and was still nicely tied and presented. I washed them in cold water and dried them on medium heat in the dryer. As with most new towels, they did shed quite a bit of lint but they looked nice and were soft coming out of the dryer. There were some stray threads but otherwise seemed to be a good quality towel (tags note 100% cotton) - time will tell after multiple ""use cycles"". The measurements on my set are as follows (approximate): bath: 52""x25"", hand: 27""x16"", and face: 12""x12"". As other reviewers have noted, the bath towel is not a ""sheet"" rather it is the more standard bath towel size. I\'m glad that this set didn\'t come with more than 2 face cloth/towels - I find that many people don\'t really use them and so they end up stored in the linen closet. For this set though, it is very nice for a guest bath, gifting or otherwise. Pricing for towels vary widely based on quality of the material, thickness, absorbency, size and other factors so it is hard to compare but the current price of this set is $31.99 seems a little high to me given it is only 6 pieces.

I needed a bunch of good towels for a wedding we were hosting at our house because at least 15 people were staying with us for several days before the event. There are many towel options on Amazon but these seemed to be a very good mix of price, fast delivery and positive reviews. They looked great when they arrived but that’s where the good news ended. I read the care instructions and followed them to the letter when washing them upon arrival. When they came out of the wash they looked like they’d been to war. Strings, snags, unraveling pieces. They looked so much worse than my old towels. I bought several different colors so I washed them all in hopes it was just one faulty bunch but they all came out looking horrible. I had read in the reviews that the amount of lint was incredible and that was no exaggeration. There was so much lint that it was blowing out of my filter. But I knew that going in so I wasn’t particularly bothered. I contacted customer service and had to answer quite a few questions as well as send pictures of the damages. They offered me two options. 1. Pack all of the towels up and mail them back for a full refund or 2. Skip sending them back and get a 50% refund. In the end, I chose to take the 50% refund because I had already thrown out all of the packaging (mass cleaning for the wedding) and it would have been an enormous pain to pack it all up and mail them back because it was over $300 worth of towels. I’m guessing they know this and that’s why they offer the 50% because they still get half your money for their bad product. I would not buy these again and if you are wanting decent towels I would keep looking.

They lasted ten years, and still do the job of drying me, however, they\'re starting to fall apart (expected after ten years).I saw the deal for these towels. I had reservations, but they were in my favorite configuration numbers (matching numbers of bath towels, hand towels, and wash cloths), and a reasonable price. What\'s the worst that could happen, they have the same lasting impression as what I bought ten years ago?They arrived promptly (I\'m still upset at the USPS guy ringing my doorbell at 6:47am, but that\'s no fault of these towels, except for the fact they were in the delivery). I opened the box to a pretty cool wrapped combo of the towels. I opened the first set and immediately said ""WOWSERS!"" Touching them was like touching the fur of a 6 week old bunny. It was impossible to not hold it up against my cheek and try to snuggle with it. I did the rule of washing them. There was the standard ""first wash"" lint, but it was less than I expected, considering the softness. And, the wash just made them softer.Their softness and absorbance is also their downfall. Using the wash cloth, I don\'t get what feels to be an abrasive exfoliation like my previous cloths gave. It\'s a lushness spreads any cleanser you use through your skin without the possibility of leaving a scratch on even the fairest of skins.When drying off, the towels absorb any excess shower water almost as instantly as the Sham-Wow guy demonstrates his product.

It does not repel water. It is very good at absorbing water. There are lots of sequins/beads sewn on most of the starfish. Two of the upper starfish have a single strand of elongated, gold beads. All the middle starfish have opaque blue sequins. Mine were nearly completely blocked out by all the sequins, except for one (it was a tad ""bald""). Two of the bottom starfish have transparent sequins. If your lightsource is from the side, you\'ll get plenty of sparkle. If your lightsource is directly above, you\'ll get virtually no sparkle. That is the case with me, so I\'m removing the opaque, blue sequins because they just look like dark blue dots—not very appealing. If you\'re going to remove any sequins, I\'d suggest using a cuticle nipper. Otherwise, there is a real good chance of ruining the shower curtain. One reviewer said the fabric looks like burlap. That is not accurate. It looks more like a loosely-woven linen with the addition of a soft luster. The fabric is midweight. I would never wash this in a machine. The sequins will withstand the washer because they are sewn on individually with a thread that resembles fishing line. The beads are sewn on with cotton thread. If that thread breaks, the whole strand of beads will come off and go down the drain because they are not individually sewn on.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 28, 2020', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Lots of maintenance', 'author': 'lourock', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'Looks good,just gotta constantly wash and vacuum.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States March 22, 2023', 'is_verified': True}]"

I usually prefer towels that are predominately cotton or with a high percentage of cotton I think just because that's what I've always been used to. The problem is, that cotton towels take forever to dry. Sometimes it feels like you should have a clothes dryer in your bathroom. These towels are all polyester fiber so no cotton, also called microfiber.I like the color and design of these towels. The stripes are a nice departure from the same old solid colors you usually find in the bathroom. I like the way they are made, they have a nice hem around the edge and they even include a small hanging loop on the edge of the hem so that you can hang the towel on a hook without worrying about it falling on the floor. Instead of the fabric just being a flat tight weave like most bath/beach towels the fabric in these towels is more fluffy. Close up it almost sort of reminds me of the weave of a shaggy carpet. That profile in the fabric makes these towels a lot more absorbent than some other flat-weave synthetic towels I own. I don't like feeling as if I just wiped myself off with a piece of plastic that didn't absorb any of the water that was on me. They have avoided that with these towels and I'm pretty impressed with that. The large towels are very big. They feel huge compared to the other full-size bath towels we have, but that's fine. They're certainly a great size for the pool or beach so that's a plus. I guess the number one thing about these towels is that because they are synthetic they really do dry out a lot faster, in the dryer and just hanging there. Anyone who has reached for their towel in the shower or at the pool only to discover that it is mostly damp will appreciate that."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 15, 2024', 'is_verified': False}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Super buy', 'author': 'Jessie Z.', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I am attracted by the color.

They\'re a bit softer than those you get at the large superstores, but I have trouble believing they\'re truly Turkish cotton, which is typically tightly woven and not as ""fluffy"" as these towels. They are fairly lightweight for the fluff you get, so I am hopeful. They are well made with straight, double-stitched edges, not warped or curled and the absorbency is good. They\'re, in my opinion, just basic towels though, and not quite what I had hoped for in my guest bath. I suppose the real test will come after several washings to see whether the threads hold and will update if there are issues. My biggest problem is that where they say ""bright white"", they are not. They have a definite yellow tint to them, as you can see from the photo where I placed a piece of bright white paper on it. The other off-putting this is that they had a scent added that made them smell like fabric softener. I guess that\'s better than a weird chemical smell, but a scent added to new towels just made me think that it was perhaps covering a less pleasant odor and was a bit strange on new towels. I will most likely just end up using these for daily use instead of the truly white luxury towels I had hoped for in my guest bath.

Absorb water well.', 'author': 'Mia G.', 'rating': 5, 'content': '• Style and version:-Style: Bath Towels Set of 6-Color: Navy (The navy isn\'t a true navy blue, it\'s more of a mid toned blue, the pictures in the listing that show it more as mid-toned blue for the navy are are accurate in color.)•Overall Impression:-This is a great set of over sized bath towels. They are very soft, high quality, large sized and absorb water very well. It’s a good value for the quality and how many towels are included in the set.-Just understand, that these are not standard cotton towels. They won\'t look and feel quite like cotton (or cotton blends) on the skin. Not everyone will like the difference, it may take some getting used to. Once I was used to the difference, I actually prefer these to standard cotton towels.-These are synthetic, microfiber towels. They aren\'t cotton or a cotton blend. They are made of 100% polyester. In older style towels, that might not be a good thing for the feel and performance. In these, it\'s actually a plus and a good thing. If you\'re thinking that they\'re cheap feeling due to this, they\'re not.-They aren\'t like a cotton loop towel. Nor are the like velvety synthetic or blended towels. They\'re closest to a soft faux fur blanket in texture. Not overly thick like a blanket, they\'re mid-weight thickness (not too thin or thick). This also isn\'t quite like a thin, rough microfiber cleaning towel or cloth, these are a lot fluffier, thicker and softer than those.-They do absorb water very well. I was worried they would be like standard microfiber cleaning cloths that don\'t seem to absorb well, but they are nothing like that. The pull the water away from you more than wipe it off, if that makes sense. So it will feel different during drying off than a normal towel. I found I got just as dry, just as quickly with these towels as a standard cotton bath towel.-The textured pattern isn\'t as deep in the towel in person as it is in the pictures. After washing it fluffs up and looks more like a standard towel vs a patterned or textured towel. It\'s there but less noticible. If you were wanting towels that are more quilted in a pattern or textured, these don\'t quite look that way in person. They do at first, but not after washing them.-The tag on them says to wash in cold water. I always wash my towels in hot water (standard washer, top vs front loader). So I did wash these in hot water with my normal laundry soap. I had no issues with shrinkage, dye running (even when washed with lighter washcloths that were cotton). (I would suggest the first wash be by themselves just to be safe.)-I was impressed that even on the first wash and dry, there was almost no lint in my dryer from them. They don\'t shed fiber or lint during use or in the dryer. When I trialed one (then later all of them) in a laundry load with my older standard cotton towels, washcloths, hand-towels I was also impressed.-I didn\'t have issues with lint or shedding on the microfiber towels. I get quite a bit of laundry dryer lint with my cotton towels in the lint screen, but none stuck to the microfiber towels. They took about 5 minutes longer to dry on high heat than my cotton towels do. You may have to slightly adjust your dryer time if it\'s not on an auto setting.-I ended up liking these so much, I replaced my worn out cotton towels with these and plan to get more. My husband was skeptical he would like these (he dislikes microfiber in general), and he loved them too and we both think they are the softest, best towels we’ve used or had. We both prefer them to traditional cotton towels and are switching to this style as our old cotton towels needed replacing.-There are matching hand-towels and washcloths in this fabric, brand and style but I haven\'t tried those yet. But they are available if you want or need them.-One big plus these towels have is the edge stitching vs standard cotton towels, it\'s edging vs just a folded towel. I have issues with my standard cotton towels (even more pricey ones that are good quality) eventually wearing out on the edges and the edges pulling off and leaving strings and threads on the edges. I don\'t think these will do that, due to the microfiber and how well the edges are stitched with actual edging material.• What’s Included:-Note: There are several variations in this listing.-6 bath towels (in this variation)• Size:-Large, over-sized.-Bath sheet style.-55"" inches long-27"" inches wide.• Pros-what I liked and what worked well:-Very, very soft like a faux-fur blanket in feel. Mid-weight, not too thin or thick.-Absorb water well and dry well.-Microfiber, synthetic material (100% polyester) that\'s high quality and should hold up very well.-Hanging loop on the side to hang them up.-Good edge stitching with actual edging material. The edges should hold up very well.-Lightly textured pattern (but in person after washing, it\'s not noticible, they just look fluffy).-Wash very well even on hot water. No issues with shrinking or fabric dye running. (The tags do say cold water though.)-Dry very well in a dryer on high heat. Produce very little lint, don\'t shed. They don’t come out wrinkled at all out of the dryer.-Easy to fold and fold well without creases and wrinkling. They take up less space than thicker cotton towels for the amount of towels in the area.-There are coordinating hand towels and washcloths in the color and product line. (May not be included in every variation, they weren\'t in mine.)-The navy color isn\'t a dark navy but more of a mid toned blue, it was really pretty in the bathroom with the shower curtain.-Large, over-sized bath sheet size. They wrap around you very well.-Have no unpleasant scent to them.-Microfiber causes less frizz on the hair than cotton towels.• Cons-what I didn’t like and what didn’t work well:-No issues.• Tips & Thoughts:-I would suggest not using fabric softener with these towels (liquid or dryer sheet). I did not and stopped doing that long ago. I found that towels perform better if no fabric softener is ever used.-I did wash them in hot water on a normal cycle (top vs front load washer) and had no issues (in the navy color). But do note, the tags say to wash in cold water. I prefer my towels washed in hot water.-They aren\'t cotton towels and will feel different on the skin during use. Once you get used to the difference (it may feel odd at first), they really perform well and are super soft. Think of letting them wick and pull the water away from you vs rubbing it off of you.-They do seem to take about 5 minutes longer than my cotton towels in the dryer.-I don\'t think when hung up to dry in the bathroom that they dry quite as fast as cotton towels.

The towels are massive, I wish I had found these back when I was a lot bigger because back then a regular size bath towels couldn't close when I wrapped them around me, so I wasn't able to walk around in them after a shower. These wrap around me almost two full times, and because they're a little stretchy, when I move around, they're not tugging and coming undone. After using the towel, I'm dry, I'm comfy with it being so soft and wrapped around me, I have absolutely no complaints. I do see some reviews questioning the longevity of these, which I cannot speak to yet, but I'll be sure to update in another month or so after a few washes because if these do have some longevity to them, I'll absolutely be ordering more and replacing my entire stock of bath towels.

When it came time to replace my towels, I naturally tried to replace them with the same kind. Unfortunately one bath towel set of that type cost over $7000 now. After doing some research I found that, in general, what made towels good was (1) 100% Egyptian cotton (that\'s a type of cotton, not cotton from Egypt), (2) properly finished edges (so they don\'t unravel), and (3) heavy weight -- for a bath towel, over 700 grams per square meter (GSM). From the Celestia towels, I also found a fourth: well-designed weaving, which may be different for the washcloth than for the bath towel.Here I found a bath towel with >750 GSM, hand towel with ~700 GSM, and washcloth at about 650 GSM. All are absorbent and the washcloth\'s weave makes it comparatively easy to dry. These are all soft and comfortable (I\'ve been using them for three months), and, unlike every other towel set I\'ve owned, they don\'t get stiff after washing and drying. Even after 10 days\' use, my washcloth still dries flexible and soft on the rack; when I wash the towel set, they come out feeling as comfortable as after the first wash.

As a result, I end up with crusty eye jam in the morning which isn\'t always easy to gently wipe away with a damp washcloth. I have found that a thinner cloth is better and ideally soft, but not too soft. This cloth falls into that category as it is on the thinner side without being ultra-thin and it is soft, but not as soft as the thicker more high-end ones. The material quality grade is about a A- or B+ so you won\'t mistake it as coming from a 4 or 5 star hotel bathroom. In a nutshell, they aren\'t winning any ""seamstress of the year"" awards with inconsistent threading at times, but they aren\'t bargain basement looking either. If you are the type of person that is highly sensitive to visual flaws, these are likely not for you, but otherwise they are pretty nice looking if you don\'t examine them too closely.That being said, for the price paid, the value is good. And for my purposes they are on point and the gray color goes with our modern condo look and color theme.

It is short as several people mentioned but this is not an issue for me as i intend to add something to make it longer (I'm using it for a shower not over a bathtub). I purchased a light beige liner (it is longer,hangs below the curtain and peeks above as one reviewer mentioned) but it is too light as there is no beige in this curtain. All the colors are bold and dark. A brown shower curtain liner would have worked better so I might dye the one I bought (its fabric). I did not have the color contrast between the valance and the curtain that someone mentioned, They are both the same vibrant color.

The wash cloth seemed to rough when used on my face compared to other towels i own. I washed them once before first use, and I use vinegar for fabric softener with a little fragrance oil, and a non toxic homemade detergent, in the dryer is 6 wool dryer balls with fragrance matching the drops in wash. Maybe they will soften after a few more wash cycles. Quality seems average to me. They seem to kind of get wrinkled on the edges fairly easily.

This towel isn't just about drying off; it's a full-on experience.First off, it's like wrapping yourself in a cozy cloud. This thing is seriously thick and plush – 600 grams per square meter kind of plush. The weight gives it this luxurious feel that makes you feel all pampered, like you're at a spa in your own bathroom.But what really blew my mind is the microfiber magic. It's so soft, it's like getting a gentle hug from your towel. I've got sensitive skin, and this material is a total lifesaver. No more scratchy, rough towels for me – it's pure smoothness all the way.And can we talk about how crazy absorbent this thing is? I practically step out of the shower, give myself a quick once-over, and bam – I'm dry. It's like it has this secret superpower for sucking up water in record time. I love it because who wants to be hanging around waiting to air-dry when you've got things to do?Durability-wise, this towel is a trooper. I've put it through a few wash as a test, and it still comes out looking and feeling brand new. No sad, thin, worn-out towel vibes here – it's holding up like a champ.Oh, and the color options are low-key classy. I went for a simple solid color that fits right into my bathroom vibe. It's not trying too hard, just quietly making everything look a bit more put together.Sure, it might cost a bit more than your average towel, but let me tell you, it's worth every penny.

I used the towels for the first time and was thoroughly impressed. The towels are massive, I wish I had found these back when I was a lot bigger because back then a regular size bath towels couldn't close when I wrapped them around me, so I wasn't able to walk around in them after a shower. These wrap around me almost two full times, and because they're a little stretchy, when I move around, they're not tugging and coming undone. After using the towel, I'm dry, I'm comfy with it being so soft and wrapped around me, I have absolutely no complaints. I do see some reviews questioning the longevity of these, which I cannot speak to yet, but I'll be sure to update in another month or so after a few washes because if these do have some longevity to them, I'll absolutely be ordering more and replacing my entire stock of bath towels.

Climate change is REAL people! Which means my house is a million times more humid than it ever was before. Consequently, thick towels never dry and always smell like mildew, even when clean. These guys are thin enough that they air dry well, so no dampness or mildew smell. I guess I'm changing my expectations along with time changing things (like the damn weather).

At 35"" x 70"", they are larger than your average bath towel, providing a luxurious and enveloping feel. Wrapping myself in one of these towels feels like being cocooned in comfort—a spa-like experience right at home!What sets these towels apart is their highly absorbent microfiber material. The towels effortlessly soak up moisture, leaving my skin feeling dry and refreshed in no time. I appreciate the quick-dry feature, as it saves time and prevents that musty smell that can sometimes linger in damp towels.The quality of these towels is evident in their construction. They are well-made, with sturdy edges that have withstood multiple washes without any signs of fraying. The color has remained vibrant, and the texture remains soft and plush, maintaining its like-new appearance.The four-pack is an excellent value for the price, ensuring that I always have a fresh towel on hand. Whether you want to upgrade your bathroom or seek a thoughtful gift, the Tigona 4 Pack Bath Towel Set is a fantastic choice.

Each towel has a hanging loop so you have options as far as hanging. They are well hemmed as well - no crooked seams or anything.They dry amazingly fast, so that is the biggest plus for me.

These do not deserve to be called towels. They are so thin you can see right through them, and they are totally non-absorbent and feel unpleasant on your skin. They are also supposed to be assorted but I got four identical ugly dark ones and one slightly lighter color (more navy blue, not as much black) but still ugly. I was really hoping for at least one yellow one since the pictures show very bright colors including yellow. I got black and gray, maroon-black, olive green-black and the same thing on the other side. They also have an obnoxious intense chemical smell like they have been in a container with fish and I had to wash them twice in a detergent with built-in fragrance to get rid of it, and I don\'t like using perfumed detergent. If they get wet at all, the fish smell comes back. Yes, they would be good as beach towels as far as being something to lie on instead of directly on the sand. Period. That\'s all they can say for themselves. A flat sheet would be better. They are not any good for drying off. Yes, they shake off the sand and they dry quickly, but that is because there is not enough fabric for the sand to stick to in the first place, they are coarse, and they dry fast because they never absorb enough water to actually get wet. Even as a towel after showering at home, they don\'t dry you off. Also, with beach towels it is helpful if you can recognize your towel and find your spot because of the towel color or brightness, and it is part of the fun of being at the beach to stake out your spot and lie on an oversized towel, and these are just grim. Who would want to slink up to such a depressing spot? I would not visit them upon guests who were going to the beach. As for product versatility, I almost cut these up into bed liners for my cat carriers but my cats deserve something more comfortable. Instead I am using these towels for car seat covers. Also when my mop wore out and I needed something to clean the floor with, I soaked the towels in a bucket (it took a LONG time) and then I pushed them around the floor with my feet.I hated this purchase as soon as I saw the ""assortment"" of colors they had sent me and everything else confirmed that impression of a letdown.

That must be true because the towels are labeled ""Made in Turkey"" with ""100% Turkish Cotton"".The set comes tied up with a ribbon, so it looks nice enough to be a gift. It includes two oversized bath towels (claimed 30""x54"", actual 28""x53.5""), two hand towels (claimed 16""x30"", actual 15""x29""), and two face towels (claimed 13""x13"", actual 14""x11.5"").

Standard towels are 20""x40"" and large hotel towels are 30""x60"", so these bath towels were close enough to large hotel towels to justify Amazon\'s ""Hotel Spa Bath Towels"" description.These towels are definitely super-soft, fluffy and plush. The rings of cotton are small and low-profile that feel gentle against the skin, but the bath towels don\'t seem as absorbent as thicker towels. All three types of towels use the same material, which is fine for the face towels but seems too thin to make the bath towels feel luxurious. The thickness reminds me of terry toweling dish cloths. Too early to comment about the durability of the towels.The packaging indicates the cotton material has undergone OEKO-TEX/STANDARD 100 testing that proves it contains no chemicals harmful to human health (or at the very least, below limits set by European standards). For what it\'s worth, I verified the certificate number with OEKO-TEX and it confirmed the material was a 100% cotton terry towel, but didn\'t identify ""ceoberry"" as the company.

Shopko is now a thing of the past so I figured I'd try these. I just put them through their first washing and while they came out beautifully, I find it hard to break in new towels because for the first six or so washings, the lint trap gets full and needs to be emptied multiple times. I honestly don't think there is a towel made that doesn't shed the first few times in the dryer and these are no different in that aspect. That being said, the texture on these is great, they are soft & absorbent and the blue color I ordered is a lovely icy, silver blue. These are great towels and exactly what I was looking for.

It was chilly one night and my SIL was walking around wearing one like a throw blanket because she said it was so soft and cozy hahaha. They were a huge hit! Everyone asked for the link to buy their own set for their homes. I have spent an embarrassing amount of money on high end towel sets in the past and have never had a guest even mention anything about their towel experience prior to buying these. You can’t beat the price, the sizes are perfect and colors are vibrant. One of the most important details I found out about when researching microfiber towels is if they have a finished hem, which these do. That was the final deciding factor in choosing these towels and I’m glad I did because other towel sets look very similar but they have no hem and frankly look cheap and unfinished. If you give these towels a try, you’ll be microfiber converted too. They are also amazing for drying your hair after a shower, the absorbency is insane.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 21, 2021', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': ""5.0 out of 5 stars Best towels I've ever bought! PERFECT for our RV!"", 'author': 'Shopping Ninja', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I bought these towels for our RV, since we need something that is lightweight and will dry very quickly. I've never owned microfiber towels before and these have turned out to be the best towels we've ever had. They are very plush, similar to the surface of a microfiber blanket only with a bit lighter nap. They absorb water instantly! You just have to lay the towel on the surface of your skin and you're dry! We love that, since we don't have a lot of room in the RV shower to be waving a big towel around. They have a loop sewn into the edge of each towel which lets you hang them on a hook. The loop is somewhat small and may not last as long as the towels do, but so far none of the loops have torn after many uses.The towels also wash beautifully and the color has not faded at all. They were so inexpensive for the set that I anticipated they'd be rather marginal quality. Instead, they've turned out to be a wonderful value and I've already bought a second set for our RV. We hang them on hooks in the shower when we've used them and they usually are completely dry within 2 or 3 hours.I read the negative reviews that talk about how they feel like drying off on a microfiber blanket. Of course they do, they're microfiber towels. What do people think they're going to feel like? If you want a towel that feels like terry cloth, you should buy terry cloth towels. If you want a very soft, VERY absorbent towel that dries quickly, these are ideal.I'll probably replace the towels in our master bath with these, we're so happy with how they've worked out in the RV.

When dry they feel awesome against my skin. They look great. I like the diamond pattern.It is the Texture that stops them from being easy to use!?! Who would have thought?!?The Microfiber Towel has Tufted Fibers which somewhat resemble a standard towel. My old towel for comparison has more stringlike tufts and because it's a Cotton Poly blend it doesn't cling to my skin the way these towels do. ( I also bought the set of 10 matching towels and that has 6 facecloths.) The face cloths are a great example of the clinginess of the fabric. You can't just wipe your face or scrub your forehead with them as I was used to with the traditional type of facecloth. It stuck to my face and was nearly impossible to rub with. I had to ball it up to create air space that let me use it. I will buy use regular face cloths from now on! That effect happens in large scale with the 40X80 Towels. They want to just cling to my back getting them to move back and forth was a problem of physics. Resistance and Slack! I used the standard size towels instead as I could get a better grip on the shorter length and be able to keep it taut enough to pull the towel across my back and defeat the super cling. I would recommend these as beach towels where you want to wrap up in something soft and warm and then the fabric will whisk the water away and dry you off. I am sure the kids will love being wrapped up in them after a bath. So, I give the 40X80 Beach Towel 5 stars but only as a beach towel or after shower wrap. As a bath towels they're a 3 at best because of the clinginess.

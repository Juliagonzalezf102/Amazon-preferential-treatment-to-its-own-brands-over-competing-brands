My one problem was that the top panel had a deep cut taken out of it, possibly from a box cutter in the factory? There were no cuts on the packaging, so I am unsure how it happened. This was disappointing as I would need all 4 panels to make a square and did not feel comfortable leaving a sharp cut within baby's reach.

It\'s not perfect (pros and cons below), but I still love it and am very satisfied with this purchase!Pros: 1) I love that I was able to build a giant mirror for only about $180 (after buying 3m Command Strips as an alternative installation option). 2) Easy and cheap shipping (they come in a very small box). 3) Easy install (with 3m Command Strips you can remove the tiles and put them back up as many times as needed to get it perfect). 4) Modular and scalable you can set them up in any configuration or shape you want and expand/add more later. 5) If you move to a new place, you can take them with you (just buy more Command Strips). 6) The tiles look like real mirrors. 7) Speedy delivery.Cons: 1) Distorted image or gaps between tiles. If you put them right up against eachother the cracks distort the image. If you put a small gap between them it looks better but then you have tiny gaps. With the 3m Command Strips, I was able to do lots of trial and error to get the most seamless mirror possible, but it\'s still not absolutely perfect. 2) The sticky stuff they provide (glue and double sided sticky foam) will ruin a wall if you need to remove them (see other reviews). This is where the 3m Command Strips come in. I got the ""small"" size and cut them in half, putting one in each corner of every tile, and haven\'t had a single issue. These added about $40 to my total project cost, but is well worth it for the ease of installation, removal and moveability.All in all, I would go this route again if I ever have to set up another home gym on a budget. It is a very affordable and easy way to have a huge mirror. You just have to decide if you want small gaps between tiles or a fun house effect along the edges, which still beats spending a thousand dollars on a giant heavy mirror in my opinion.

Instead, I recommend using a “J mold mirror mount” to support the bottom of mirror and plastic mirror clips for the top (to keep it from tipping forward). See my photos of bracket and clips from the orange big box store. I also took photos comparing a J Bracket to the flimsy one that comes with the mirror (which wedges the mirror flush against a wall … unless your wall is perfectly flat, you’re in for trouble if you use the supplied bracket). Trust me, this will eliminate the warping, distortions, and heartache mentioned in other reviews.Secure the J bracket to studs (16” apart in most homes so I found 3 or 4 for my 48” J bracket). You can supplement with 1-2 drywall anchors. You will need to drill a couple holes in the aluminum J bracket to line up with your studs. Use a 1/8” drill bit on the bracket and 13/64” bit for the drywall anchors from my photo. The screws that come with the mirror are 1-inch #8 wood screws 1”. These are not quite long enough to go deep enough into studs (get your mind out of the gutter and read on). Instead, pick up 1 1/4” wood screws instead (also #8) to secure the J bracket to the studs. Pick up and 1 1/2” #6 for the mirror clips if you want to hit a stud for those (optional, drywall anchors enough for mirror clips). The mirror rests in the channel of the J bracket and allows play so your mirror stays straight!)Hope this helps. You will not needy adhesive if you use the J bracket on the bottom (cradles the mirror in the channel) and clips at the top.

Jackson', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Okay, first the con. Yes, this is a lighted mirror. There are tiny, bright LED lights all around the edge of the main mirror (none on the side mirrors). However, I find that they add more glare than light, but in a dim room, they may be useful. However, I wouldn\'t rely on the lighting on the mirror for things like color accuracy if you are putting on makeup. Here are the pros. First of all, it is just large enough to see your entire face easily, and it angles perfectly when I need to use it to dry and style my hair. The magnifying mirrors are located on the right--3x on top and 2x on bottom. The bottom mirror is somewhat awkward to (okay, there is another ""con""), but I\'m blind as a bat so the larger magnification is more useful for me when I need do my eye makeup. For the size, the mirror is very light. I have a hand mirror that is half the size but actually weighs more. I ordered the mirror in rose gold, and it is a deeper color than most items that come in this shade. However, it is a beautiful color and the mirror is lovely enough to leave out on your table or counter. As for travelling---unless you have a very big purse or tote, I wouldn\'t really consider this something you want to carry around with you. However, the stand comes off easily, so the whole thing can be folded flat. It should fit nicely into my larger carryon--I don\'t think I want to put glass into a check-in bag, but you could if you wanted to pack it in a way that it is padded and protected. It did arrive in the mail in one piece, after all. I bought the mirror when the price dipped just below $20.00 and it is a very good value for around that price. For better, variable lighting, you should be expected to pay a lot more. However, I am very pleased with the mirror and it\'s great to be able to easily move the mirror in the needed position (not have to force it down or up with both hands) AND have it STAY that way (it doesn\'t move until you move it).', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 27, 2019', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Super bright mirror!', 'author': 'Adrianna', 'rating': 4, 'content': ""I like the vanity mirror however, I think it is a bit too bright for me and hurts my eyes.

Easily portable and it has a touch light that is on the large middle mirror that is very bright and useful when powered by the USB cable. I have tried it with batteries as well (especially when I misplace the cable or am not near a plug-in/outlet) and the lights are not even half as bright as when it is plugged into an outlet. But that’s been the case for many different lights and electronic items that I have owned, so it’s not the mirrors fault by any means. The mirror is great and can be adjusted to a number of angles and degrees. The magnification in all the mirrors is crystal clear and quite wonderful if you ask me. I love the way it closes when not in use and it’s pretty compact so it can be stored away until needed. However the base/stand is an oval shaped bottom and I find myself more often Then not tipping the mirror over backwards due to the length and weight of the top of it (I want to literally lay it horizontal at times, and I can’t because it will just tip backwards. Every time. ) I understand why it does it and I admit it’s a little rare to find someone who wants to tilt it back as far as I do, but that doesn’t take away from the fact that it honestly tips over and that I honestly believe it would be more stable and secure if the base was a square or rectangle and a little bigger in comparison to the degree at which it can tilt.

My hair was growing to an uncomfortable length. I did what many did during that time - turn to the internet and DIY. I reasoned that if I wasn't going to be seeing much people in-person during that time, it would be OK if I messed up trying to cut my hair. I bought a set of clippers and off I went with a handheld mirror.Fast-forward 2 years later. Barbar shops are open, but I'm still cutting my own hair. I learned a few important things during this journey. The first is to buy a good clipper set. The second is to use plenty of mirrors. While you get eventually get proficient with using a wall mirror plus a hand mirror, being able to free your other hand and not having to constantly reposition the hand mirror would have made things a lot easier.As it seems I'll be cutting my own hair for a while, I decided to cave in and buy a tri-fold mirror set. It's a simple concept that I've considered buying my own mirrors and making this myself, but finding a good way to mount it and finding strong hinges to position the side mirrors made it too much effort to DIY the mirror setup.This mirror set is convenient because it's an all-in-one unit. The door mounts pivot out from the unit and are on telescopic rods (think of the old-school radio antennas). Hook it over the door (or whatever is your mounting source) and pull it down to the right height. Open up both panels of the mirror until it's at the best angle for you. The panels stay in place due to the friction on the hinge. It should allow you to see the part of your head behind your ears. For a full view of the back of your head, you'd have to position the panels parallel to each other and look direct at one of the panels.There's not much to fault this simple item. If anything, I'd love if the mirrors had some more height to them just to have more viewing surface, but that would mean the unit would be much bigger when folded."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States November 2, 2022', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Super handy for coloring and cutting your own hair', 'author': 'N.

Now... let's rip apart!"", 'author': 'Classified', 'rating': 4, 'content': ""So I wanted to make a mirrored cabinet for my workshop that stood over the laundry sink/tub in there. I didn't need anything fancy, and wanted it roughly a foot deep to hold first aid supplies and maybe a number of hygiene items. Also, you might see, I wanted a dry rack built into the bottom over the sink. This is where I eat my lunch at the workshop and I hand wash my dishes there.They don't make mirrored vanity cabinets cheap it seems, and also they don't make them any deeper than 4.5 inches. There was no way what I wanted even partially existed for any reasonable price. So, I had to grab my scrap plywood and spend half a day making my own.Of course I selected the mirror (best dimensions to what I wanted at the cheapest price/decent quality I could find) and didn't make the cabinet until after it arrived.It arrived as I hoped and met the standards for what this was meant for: hanging up on little hooks on the wall like a picture. Something like this would make sense in your entryway or mud room, so you check your hair or something before heading out, appearance wise after it's hung the standard version in walnut looks fairly classy and would work with most interior designs, I'm sure the other colors would work as well. The frame this plasticy/particle board wood stuff and the surface you normally see is smooth and impermeable to water from that side. You can lean in and look real close and it looks like very well polished wood, but when you feel it you can tell there's plastic or polymer in the frame. Not bad for the price actually.The problem was the hook mounting hardware that was in my way... And what's this? Brown craft paper glued on the back? Not a problem if this going up in your office or a guest bedroom I guess, but this was going over a drainage tub that I filled with gallons of hot water every few days. I didn't want steam to condense in there over time and have microbial growth as a result.Using this mirror in a bathroom, or near a stove (not sure why you want to check your reflection while stirring a boiling pot of macaroni though...) this might be a pad choice. This mirror isn't marked as a bathroom mirror, so I'm not going to hold it against them at all.This was a excellent opportunity to take it apart like a child with mild ADHD who found dad's toolkit and has been left unsupervised for over 20 minutes. Not much has changed in the last 15 years in that aspect of me being a legal adult...This was also a excellent opportunity to evaluate the quality of the mirror behind it's appearance.The screws for the hanging hardware on the backside were tiny and I had to use the small screwdrivers to get them out. I'm glad they didn't use exotic screws with triangles or star shaped bits. It was standard Philips head, just the small size. The screws were a pain to get out, they were quite stiff and each one took a lot of torque to remove by hand. While annoying for me, I can say that these hooks are going to stay on and not fall off under normal circumstances for you. So this is a win for quality actually despite the fact my fingertips were notably red and sore from gripping the screwdriver so tightly.Using the most dangerous tool in my workshop: the utility knife, and a pair of needle nose pliers, I cut and ripped the paper away in a corner to find corrugated cardboard filler glued underneath it. It was actually glued on pretty well at the edges to the frame. After ripping out a tiny piece I discovered it was about 3/4 of a inch of stiff cheap cardboard and then the black glossy backside of the mirror. I cut a large square out along the inside of the frame and was able to easily remove the cardboard filler which was lightly glue to the back of the mirror with a few squiggly streaks of hot glue.I assume the purpose of the cardboard filler on the back, other than being a cheap material that's easy to work with, is to act as padding on the back side to prevent the mirror from break if hit from that side, which would only be useful during transport I guess.The brown paper overlay that was glued to the frame was very hard to peel off. Given that it was only a inch wide going around the perimeter at this point I didn't think that I needed to remove anymore at this point. I did peel off the corners to see how they jointed the frames and found a metal zigzaggy bracket holding it together. I'm no sure how it actually worked or how it may have been installed, but it looked fairly sturdy considering that this was the cheapest mirror that met the dimensions I wanted.I used some gorilla glue and almost half a dozen pneumatically driven 18 gauge 5/8 inch staples to mouth it to thin ¼ inch scrap plywood for my hinged door. I chose shorter staples to not go too deep and hit the mirror by accident. The sudden “FWAP!” of staples at 120 PSI hitting the plywood and into the back of the mirror frame did not crack it. (Whew!) So it's also durable in that regard.The mirror is decent. I give it a 4/5. I say that I feel at $40 this is a little too much money for what it is, but then again I couldn't find cheaper for something around 16 inches by 20 inches. This is a $35 or $30 mirror if you ask me, but that's perhaps a bit nit-picky. By the way, the dimensions of the glass mirror itself is 17 inches by 13 inches, the frame is 20 inches by 16 inches. The frame is 1-1/2 inches wide around the edges, and it's 1 inch deep if you take off the hanging hardware on the backside."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States July 22, 2020', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect', 'author': 'Tc', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'The bathroom mirror was just what I wanted.

Several of her girlfriends after seeing it also purchased Vesaur mirrors. Then in the summer of 2022…her makeup light failed to turn on. After troubleshooting it I decided to reach out to Vesaur’s service team and explained the situation. Even though the warranty period had expired, Vesaur’s Customer Service team showed out and get this, they sent a replacement Free of Charge!!!!! They communicated via email frequently to ensure that I was satisfied. Heck yeah! My wife and friends could not believe it.Well Valentines Day is right around the corner again and now I have a 16-year-old daughter needing a makeup mirror. I wouldn’t turn to any other manufacturer other than Vesaur. So, I purchased their best-selling mirror, Vesaur Professional 8.5” Large Lighted Makeup Mirror. The mirror arrived in 2.5 days!!! My wife has opened and tested the new mirror. She absolutely loves it and we both can’t wait until my daughter gets it for Valentines Day. It is beautiful decked out in Pearl Nickel. The features are the same as the more expensive models. Most people only take time out to write reviews when they aren’t happy.

Secondly, 10x is WAAAY to close and you have to get so close to the mirror, you can't see what you're doing! Others do not have the magnifier side lit at all. I don't like the 'compact' mirrors..all 10x magnification and small. I finally found this mirror and it has everything I want! It's large enough for travel or for home. The lighting is perfect and has the usual 3 choices. I like that it doesn't use batteries and I can charge it and/or bring the cord and a USB outlet plug to use. And best of all, the other side is just as big and is only 5x magnified, so I can see close without having to practically put my nose on the mirror!

I paid a little over $20 and will give it 3.75 - 4 stars because it is a nice packable mirror. My rating would be 1 star had I paid $39.99, the advertised list price. The mirror without the lights on and with the lights on, in good lighting, will allow good visualization to put makeup on. In early morning or low lighting, you will need to put your face very close (6-8in) to the mirror in order to see well. The view with the lights on is only 5X8 inches. The 2X and 3X magnification mirrors are so small @ 3x4.5 inches and the 10X is a little less than 3 inches in diameter, rendering them essentially useless. Using them would require that you lift the entire mirror up to your face to use. I am going to keep the mirror and use it for travel because, as said, it is a nice foldable mirror and it would work well with ample light settings. However, it will not provide adequate lighting for someone who wants to sit back and apply makeup in low lighting. My recommendations to the manufacturer would be to install the lighting in the top and bottom of the main mirror and then in side mirrors to allow a better view. Since the installed magnification mirrors are worthless, in my opinion, add them separately like the 10X magnification mirror so that the user can place them where can be easily used.

As you can see in the description, it has magnifying mirrors on the inside of one of the flaps - they\'re quite small, but good enough for most detailed makeup application. If you need magnification for ALL your makeup application, you\'ll probably want one with a bigger magnifying surface. The light is very bright and can be dimmed easily, although the color cannot be changed from bright white. It folds up and comes off of its base, which makes it more portable than most mirrors its size, although I certainly wouldn\'t consider it a ""travel"" mirror.

Both mirrors are very clear and the lights are decently bright. Only two things kept it from being 5 stars for me (well maybe three but we’ll see). One is that I thought it looked kinda small since I searched and bought a product that advertised as an 8” mirror. The mirror measures 6.5” across on the flat side and about an eighth of an inch larger on the magnified side. So the 8” isn’t the mirror, not even the mirror plus the lights. For 8” you would have to measure beyond the bezel and include the screw & plug terminal that the mirror rotates around. The second issue I have is with the touch control. Like many of these mirrors they placed a capacitive touch switch on the mirror itself, so I have to touch the mirror that I’m also trying to keep clean and it’s only on one side. The third nitpicky thing that may only become an issue if I lose the darn thing is their choice of cord. The cord has a large usb connection on one end and a barrel connection on the other end that plugs into the device. If you lose it you are never going to find another one like it so keep track of it.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 9, 2024', 'is_verified': True}]"

Honestly, my roommate and I decided to just keep it because it still works as a mirror, and the distortion of top sheet gives a really funny reflection due to a thin sticker/sign underneath (college property)—the distortion varies but the reflected results are similar to virtual filters (𝙬𝙖𝙩𝙚𝙧, 𝙢𝙤𝙨𝙖𝙞𝙘, 𝙎𝙣𝙖𝙥𝙘𝙝𝙖𝙩, 𝙚𝙩𝙘). ———————————————————I also tested these mirror sheets on two other items that differ in surface texture, to see if the outcome was the same.The first test was on a 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻 𝘀𝗹𝗮𝗯 𝗼𝗳 𝗰𝗮𝗿𝗱𝗯𝗼𝗮𝗿𝗱; same material as cardboard box packages—lightly textured with those horizontal lines, but fairly flat.

They did ship in a box, but these sheets should really be sandwiched between rigid cardboard before they leave the factory.Another problem with these is that the adhesive -- which is definitely strong enough for most purposes -- is not applied evenly, and that contributes to the wavy effect after the mirror sheet is applied. Perhaps warming the sheets with a hair dryer before application will help the adhesive even out?The best results I have gotten from these have been on perfectly clean, smooth surfaces, like on a sheet of freshly-unwrapped acrylic, but even then: there's always still some slight waviness to the reflection.

The magnification was not as close as some less expensive vanity mirrors that I have. The clarity was fine and the construction of the mirror stand was O.K. but. The mirror left and right supports do not hold the mirror in place when tilting one way or another very well. There is no way to tighten the mirror supports.

I like the size and otherwise it seems well made. I like the hanging hooks as well, in case you want it on the wall.My main issue with it is the way in which the back stand is attached to the frame. It seems like a really stupid design flaw -- the pivot bolt is very close to the back of the mirror, which is unprotected glass. As a result, when you extend the stand, there is a little bit of extra metal material above the pivot which scrapes the back of the mirror. I noticed where it touches, it has already scraped off a small part of the reflective amalgam on the back of the mirror. You can see two little damage black spots on the front. Very small, but annoying because this is just an elementary design flaw. It's does not appear to be faulty or broken, this is the actual design.You can unscrew the base and 'reverse' the brackets so that it still works without scraping the glass, or you can just remove it and hang/lean it.I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't for that minor issue.

It arrived in mint condition in two days with Prime shipping.• The frame is made of square aluminum tubing and is very rigid.• The ‘fun house’ mirror effect that some complain about was only observable when I stood half way across the room, focused on a single object (table lamp) and moved slowly from side to side. Honestly, if I wasn’t looking for it I wouldn’t have picked up on the minimal distortion (certainly not enough to move this comment to the Cons section• The stand was fully assembled and recessed into the frame to allow me to leave it in place and still mount flat to the wall.Cons:• It was listed as 18”x58” but it was closer to 17 ¼” W by just short of 58”L.• The mounting brackets are heavy duty but unfortunately they are a rigid key-hole-slot design with no room for mounting measurement errors. Typical, brackets have an adjustable triangular piece of heavy metal at the top of each wall mounting point and allow for some degree of inaccuracy in width spacing between the brackets. Not these puppies. Be sure your measurements are accurate down to the 16th inch (see tip below).• Speaking of the brackets, they were attached with a 1/8” difference in height (bottom to top). I needed to adjust the wall anker for different heights to compensate.Installation Tip:• Reuse a long piece of the shipping plywood to make a template for the screw holes. This will save you from having a crooked mirror or patching drywall.• Layout the spacing exactly as you think you will on the wall. If you need to adjust one of the screws vertically to compensate for different bracket heights, this is the place to do it before drilling into the wall in the wrong place.• Drill 1/8” holes in the plywood exactly where the screws will be located and inert them almost completely into the template.• Flip the template over and slide the screw heads onto the frame brackets to see if you got all of the spacing right. I measured from the frame bottom to the mounted template.• When it fits correctly.

After all, what is there to say about a mirror? It\'s reflective, uh, it\'s… Big enough for the space? But even mirrors need reviews so here I am. My wife and I recently remodeled all three bathrooms in our house (not at the same time thank goodness). We already had a mirror for one of the bathrooms, but we needed another two. We couldn\'t find a matching mirror for the existing one we had and our basement bathroom was done first. So I set out defined the mirror that fit that aesthetic.I landed on this mirror from Oruii because I liked the simple black framed circular design. I needed something big, but not too big (in this case I settled on the 24"" x 24""). This mirror also checked that box. And last but not least, I wanted a glass mirror (as opposed to plastic).I am happy to report that this mirror looks great! The thin black frame does a great job of accenting the edge of the mirror. The aluminum material helps keep the way down too. It has a nice easy to use hanger built into the back with angular guides that help lead whatever nail or hanging tool of choice right into the center hole. There is also a small foam square down towards the bottom to help even out the bottom side of the mirror so it sits flat against the wall.Really the only nitpick I have is very difficult to avoid. The aluminum frame does have a very small separation point at the bottom where it\'s clear that one strip of aluminum was bent around the mirror. Unfortunately, it\'s pretty easy to see. That having been said, it is pretty small, and I doubt that our guests notice it (even if I see it every day).Ultimately, I think this is a fantastic mirror for the price. Right around 50 bucks for a 24 inch circular mirror with a nice stylish black band around it? Yes, please! If I could give partial stars, this would probably get 4.75 stars. But since I can\'t, and I\'m not willing to round down for that tiny little nitpick, this is gonna end up at five stars out of five for me. Not only what I order it again, we did order another one for our other bathroom.

I needed this mirror for a space in my room where I find myself doing my makeup but don't have a mirror there.

They make larger mirrors, the 20 x 28 would have been better for the space that I need it in.This mirror arrived with some packaging glue on the mirror, but I was able to wipe it away (it did take awhile). The black frame seems light weight and sturdy enough. I did not see any directions, but it is self explanatory, I guess. The good part is that it is not heavy. Hanging a heavy mirror is the absolute worst! So the light weight feature is great! Now, the way it attaches is unique. I have never seen a mirror with that type of backing. I opted to use the heavy duty stickers as opposed to the nail in wall. I am sooooo very thrilled they offered that option! I actually LOVE the sticker nail and have never seen it before. However, I measured incorrectly and in removing it, ripped off the wall. Guess that means the nail sticker IS HEAVY DUTY! They provided two sets of nails and also two sets of sticker nails. Thankful for that! Since that was my fault for mis-measuring, no complaints there. Overall I'm ok with it. The price is a little high, but mirrors seem to be getting expensive these days.

But, I ordered this twice, since 4 in a pack seems like *just* not enough for the size of these things. First time, product was great! It came with 32 adhesive pads, you're meant to place 8 on the back of each mirror. This was fine, the adhesive is really strong and I've never had an issue with the mirrors using this kind of adhesive. The problem is when I ordered again. They seemed to have sent a slightly different product, or maybe a different version of the same product? The second time around, the mirrors were *ever* so slightly smaller (not enough to be noticeable from a distance, but still), and the adhesive was different. This time, the back of each mirror was covered with a pre-applied adhesive that would let the mirror attach to the wall directly. Problem is, this version of the product is pretty mediocre. The adhesive back is just not that strong, and 2 out of the 4 mirrors that use this have a lot of trouble staying attached to the wall, so much so that I've resorted to using thumbtacks to support them when they inevitably peel off. These simple little mirrors are great and do what they need to do, but you should pray that you only get the kind that comes with the adhesive pads rather than the much much worse subpar grade school glue that seems to be used on the newer mirrors."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 13, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '3.0 out of 5 stars Reliable, But Not Without Flaws: UNBREAKABL MIRO Shower Mirror Review', 'author': 'RavenBlueFeather', 'rating': 3, 'content': ""I've been using the UNBREAKABLE MIRO Shower Mirror for a few months now, and it has its ups and downs.

You have to peel that thing off first by kind of picking at the edge to loosen it and then the rest just easily peels away to reveal the night reflective surface underneath. Maybe they should include a little slip of paper with a pictorial instruction related to that.But after that is off, as a mirror, it\'s just fine.However the type of plastic they use could be a little harder as it tends to take scratches easier than it might. The first time I used it I wrapped it up in my gym towel with my razor and toothbrush and some other harder plastic materials (not the blade of the razor) next to it and they left little scratches in it. But since then I\'ve have folded it in its own section of my gym towel and it\'s all been good. I\'ve even dropped it about three times onto the shower floor from a height of about 5ft and it seemed to suffer no particular feel effects.It would be good for camping if the ""roughing it"" part of the particular type of camping was not too rough. Otherwise I think it\'s a great safety mirror for the home gym or shower.Some people have complained that the reflective surface has been flaking off theirs, but I wonder if that\'s a defect in the product or more they\'re severe handling of it.Lastly I would say for the price it could be a dollar less OR they should at least include two of the wall suction cup hangers with it. Which for this one you have to order separately. In my gym there\'s a little metal shelf for your toiletries while you\'re in the shower that just happens to be a good heigth. So I just set it on that and prop it up against the wall and it works fine.Bottom line us, if you need a good safety mirror for your shower that\'s not going to be put through rough treatment on a daily basis, I think this is just fine. If there is no negative update to this at some future point you can assume it\'s been hanging in there well enough.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States July 20, 2022', 'is_verified': True}]"

I don't know if this is true or not, or if it used to be true but no longer is. I do know I believed it at the time because a mirror with 10X magnification could have wildly different magnification than another mirror with the same 10X label on it. The only way to really know what you were getting was to look at it and see if it had enough magnification for your purposes.\xa0The best way to get a handle on magnification always seems to be to compare different mirrors of different magnifications and see how they stack up. Obviously, that's not always practical, but with this 3 pack of FAHZON COMPACT MAGNIFYING MIRRORS, you can't NOT compare them. You get three mirrors in three different magnifications, 10X, 20X and 30X. They also come with suction cups and a travel pouch.\xa0Prepare to be amazed. This is an awesome deal for these three little travel mirrors. The one that has the highest magnification at 30X will allow you to see every hair on your eyebrow and know exactly which one you're plucking. At this magnification, it's really all you can see. There's a time when each of these three mirrors will be appropriate for whatever you need magnification for.\xa0You can clearly see the difference between each of the three magnifications. All three mirrors cost just slightly more than you might pay for one mirror at a brick-and-mortar store. And truthfully, I've never seen any mirror claim 30X magnification. You will undoubtedly see things you wish you hadn't with this product.

The 30x mirror is showing me many hairs that I can't see that I Need To See! Hubby told me I had a hair under my nose the other evening. I couldn't feel or see it. When I finally found it using the 30x mirror ... Holy Cow! That thing was a healthy 1/2 inch long! I'm almost over the trauma.I have already been using a 10x magnify mirror for several years. I love it, and it's very helpful, but apparently it doesn't tell the whole story. The 20x mirror is probably what I'll use most in the future. The 10x is a great strength for putting on eye makeup or general 'inspection' purposes. The 30x is going to take some time to get used to holding at the correct distance (close!) and in the correct position so that fingers and tweezers don't get in the way. The 20x is a great intermediate and doesthe job well, without having to be right on top of it.

But I remembered how my last mirror worked, removing it from that stand to fill a slot in the the back with hot water. So now, with this new mirror, the trick is to heat the BACK of the mirror by holding it in the hot shower water for about 15-30 seconds. It now stays fog free for the rest of my shower.Final note, also a lesson learned from my last mirror. Do not wait until water drops have dried on the face of your mirror over months and years of use. You will ruin the mirror trying to clean water spots off after they have dried.

There are two keyholes on the back that slide over two screws mounted perfectly on your wall. It would be helpful if they had told me these facts:The outside measure of the mirror is 30 1/16 x 20 1/8. The frame of the mirror extends 5/16 above the backboard, and the keyhole is recessed into the backboard 1/8” but has a “bubble” on it to accept the screw head. So if you let the screw stick out of the wall by 7/16” it will fit into the keyhole and the mirror will hang. If the screw doesn’t stick out enough, it won’t clear the frame to reach the keyhole.The two keyholes are, for horizontal hanging, 20 1/8” center-to-center, which means even if you find a stud, you will still need a drywall anchor for the second hole (as studs are 16” apart). For vertical hanging, the keyholes are 10 ½ “ apart.The mirror comes with some drywall anchors and screws but they didn’t look adequate. The mirror weighs 10 lbs and to allow for stress on it during cleaning the glass, allow 15 lbs. So I bought a set of #6 drywall anchors and screws. I measured on the wall (with a level) where the holes should go. Bottom of the frame to the horizontal mounts is 15 ¼”.Drill pilot holes first with a 3/16” bit in case you’re lucky and hit a stud. I did. On the other hole, the pilot hole is about 5/16” to accept the anchor. When you put in your screws, you have to estimate the head extension 7/16 by eye. You can always screw in more, but you can’t screw out without ruining the anchor.Make the same keyhole measurements on the reflecting side of the mirror and mark the keyhole locations on the glass with lipstick or Vaseline. That helps you align the screws with the keyholes, a procedure that is otherwise blind. I put a few 3M sticky pads at the bottom of the mirror to fill the space between the frame and the backboard so it wouldn’t rattle.The mirror looks really classy. It’s a great product at a great price. But you do need a bit of patience to install it. I should have hired someone.

So be sure to use your own wall anchors and screws.It was a beast to hang because the mirror is NOT flush with the black border. Because of this, the mirror will stick out from the wall and will lay flush with the border, not the back of the mirror. As you can imagine, you then need to ensure your screws are sticking far enough out to catch the mirror, which is why the hardware that came with the mirror is not long enough.Overall 4/5 stars, looks great and I feel more secure using sturdier and longer screws that we had.

However overall once hung on the wall I don’t expect any issues. Also, there was a gap mentioned where the frame comes together is small and positioned at the top of each frame if you were to hang it vertical.Hanging kit: I do agree the screws/anchors provided to hang the mirror seem small, so to be safe I will be buying bigger ones.Packaging: Each mirror came individually wrapped and well packed. 10/10 would recommend', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 25, 2024', 'is_verified': True}]"

In other words you have to turn the mirror over to turn it on and then turn it over to use the magnification mirror. Bad design. Why not have the switch on the base? My old mirror had a finger touch base to turn the light on and off and I loved it. Also this mirror is too small. It’s much smaller than our previous mirror. The only problem is, the company that makes our previous Mirror stopped making it, so this looks like our best choice. It may have a longer lasting battery and that was a problem with my old mirror. it also has a modern charger cord, that’s a big plus. My old mirror had the old charger socket and it was really annoying. Pros and cons. I think I’d be happy if the on switch was on the magnifying mirror which is the one I use instead of the backside, which is really annoying to have to turn it over after you turn it on.

Local big box store currently only carries one with a small built in light (bulkier and the light is terrible), so I ordered this one, and am happy with it so far.Unfortunately, the tweezers, are not of very good quality. Although I wasn’t in need of them, I thought it would be nice to have an extra pair. However, after trying them, I will *not* be using them for personal care. I’m attaching a photo to compare the La Cross set I use (nearly daily) to these. The tweezers from this set have a flat, but rather sharp edge to the tips (grasping end), which causes more of a skin grab than just hair, and they pinch fat too easily. I tested them before the review, and although quite careful, I still feel irritation of the skin where I used these. It’s not simply because I was tweezing, as I pluck a hair or two from my brows almost daily, so I don’t get irritated like someone who isn’t accustomed to it. It’s solely because of the unrefined edge of these tweezers. When I took the photo of the two, side-by-side, it was evident why they feel so different. The La Cross pair are more angled on the inside and are polished, but still provide adequate grip. I hope the photo uploads at a decent enough quality to be able to see the differences. The ones from this set are on the left, and the La Cross set are on the right (you can see the paint wearing away from use).So, the ones that came with this set will be relegated to either the craft room or the tool box.

I had a previous two-piece shower mirror that had a razor hook, so I just stand my new mirror up where a razor would go. See photo.Now, pay attention if you want to be happy: This mirror fogged up pretty quickly on my first use. But I remembered how my last mirror worked, removing it from that stand to fill a slot in the the back with hot water. So now, with this new mirror, the trick is to heat the BACK of the mirror by holding it in the hot shower water for about 15-30 seconds. It now stays fog free for the rest of my shower.Final note, also a lesson learned from my last mirror. Do not wait until water drops have dried on the face of your mirror over months and years of use. You will ruin the mirror trying to clean water spots off after they have dried. Instead, while drying your body, take a few seconds at the end of every shower to gently blot away the water drops while still wet.Enjoy!', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 4, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars UPDATED review!!!!!!!!

The new ones have thin, flimsy metal and a plastic mirror. They weigh only 1.75 ounces. It’s the same ASIN (Amazon catalog number) but not the same product. Too bad. These were nice. Now they’re poor-quality junk.Why does China do this? They had a great product. But they tried to cut costs to make a few more cents off of it and now they have a product not worth buying. So sad.And I’m frustrated that Amazon permits such a significant change to the product while still allowing it to be sold under the same listing.——————————-Original 2016 ReviewThis is nice. It's a real glass mirror that gives a good, clean, bright, detailed, color-correct reflection in a nice metal case. It's a bit large for pocket-carry, but it's big enough to actually shave with. It is glass and will, if you drop it, I'm sure, break. But it's durable enough for common use. Being glass, it is a bit heavy, about four ounces, a quarter-pound, but it is a real glass mirror with all of the advantages of one.Be aware that it does come directly from China, so, while it shipped within a few hours of placing the order, it does still take a few weeks to come."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 10, 2016', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Slim enough to fit in a smaller handbag', 'author': 'JCMH', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I like the clarity of the mirror, the lightweight stainless brushed steel construction, even sent one to my niece who will use it when she is on a gig.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States July 20, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '2.0 out of 5 stars Not worth the money due to the size', 'author': 'Suzender Benn', 'rating': 2, 'content': 'Not worth the money, but it will work for traveling.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 24, 2024', 'is_verified': True}]"

Finding a vanity set in the right style and size with a lighted tri-fold mirror was near impossible to find in a price range that I was willing to pay. This set of wired globes was exactly the finishing touch that I needed for the secondhand vanity that I refurbished for my 6-year-old\'s ""Princess Palace"" style bedroom.First off, don\'t be in a rush to remove the lights from the box system. Take your time with this process to avoid tangling and losing your place. I located the power end first, then worked my way to the other end.Before adhering the lights to the mirror, I carefully draped them in a single line over my right shoulder since I was working from right to left. This kept them from bunching and clanging together. Having a good helper for this part would be great too.Next, I would suggest plugging the lights in before installing to make sure they are all working properly. Depending on where the outlet that you are going to use for setup is located, it would be a good idea to start your installation from the power end so that you can be sure that the plug\'s reach, the power button, and the positioning of the first bulb on that end are to your liking.Installing the lights took some time, patience, and careful planning. What I found helpful was to map out the arrangement with pieces of painter\'s tape for correct spacing. During the installation process, I quickly found the suction cups to work much better than expected. They stick very firmly but can be removed and reset if adjustments are needed. I would advise giving them a lighter press until you have achieved the placement that you desire, then go back around and press them more firmly. As I placed each bulb, I wrapped some of the wire around the base, being sure that wherever I stopped wrapping would be on whichever side was the closest edge of the mirror. That way, when I would place the following bulb, I could tuck the excess between the joints where the mirrors folded. I preferred this method to only winding the wires and having them show on top of the mirrors. The method I used created a much cleaner look, where the wiring is almost undetectable (as shown in the 2nd photo). Also, the hinges between the mirrors made for good anchoring points. I continued this pattern of sticking, winding, and tucking until the last bulb was in place.When my daughter came home from her weekend away, she was thrilled to see that her vanity lights were installed and ready to illuminate her smiling face. We both love the many levels of adjustable brightness that be achieved by pressing and holding through the 10 stages. We tend to keep them somewhere in the middle. When you turn the lights off they remember your last setting. So it\'s nice not having to reset the brightness each time. Only a light touch is needed to activate/deactivate the lights and because I placed the button on the vanity between the right-most mirror and her perfume tray, she is able to easily access it by herself, without it being in the way of her primping. Now when she plays with her pretend makeup, she has optimal lighting and as soon as I finish making her vanity seat, she will no longer need to sit on her toilet lid to get her hair done.This has been a super purchase! The quality is everything that I had hoped for and for a terrific price. Once I find the right makeup vanity for myself, I will surely be back to purchase another set.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 28, 2021', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Easy, quick vanity.', 'author': 'Amazon Customer', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'These were easy to put on and look amazing!

There are two keyholes on the back that slide over two screws mounted perfectly on your wall. It would be helpful if they had told me these facts:The outside measure of the mirror is 30 1/16 x 20 1/8. The frame of the mirror extends 5/16 above the backboard, and the keyhole is recessed into the backboard 1/8” but has a “bubble” on it to accept the screw head. So if you let the screw stick out of the wall by 7/16” it will fit into the keyhole and the mirror will hang. If the screw doesn’t stick out enough, it won’t clear the frame to reach the keyhole.The two keyholes are, for horizontal hanging, 20 1/8” center-to-center, which means even if you find a stud, you will still need a drywall anchor for the second hole (as studs are 16” apart). For vertical hanging, the keyholes are 10 ½ “ apart.The mirror comes with some drywall anchors and screws but they didn’t look adequate. The mirror weighs 10 lbs and to allow for stress on it during cleaning the glass, allow 15 lbs. So I bought a set of #6 drywall anchors and screws. I measured on the wall (with a level) where the holes should go. Bottom of the frame to the horizontal mounts is 15 ¼”.Drill pilot holes first with a 3/16” bit in case you’re lucky and hit a stud. I did. On the other hole, the pilot hole is about 5/16” to accept the anchor. When you put in your screws, you have to estimate the head extension 7/16 by eye. You can always screw in more, but you can’t screw out without ruining the anchor.Make the same keyhole measurements on the reflecting side of the mirror and mark the keyhole locations on the glass with lipstick or Vaseline. That helps you align the screws with the keyholes, a procedure that is otherwise blind. I put a few 3M sticky pads at the bottom of the mirror to fill the space between the frame and the backboard so it wouldn’t rattle.The mirror looks really classy. It’s a great product at a great price. But you do need a bit of patience to install it. I should have hired someone.

So be sure to use your own wall anchors and screws.It was a beast to hang because the mirror is NOT flush with the black border. Because of this, the mirror will stick out from the wall and will lay flush with the border, not the back of the mirror.

In other words you have to turn the mirror over to turn it on and then turn it over to use the magnification mirror. Bad design. Why not have the switch on the base? My old mirror had a finger touch base to turn the light on and off and I loved it. Also this mirror is too small. It’s much smaller than our previous mirror. The only problem is, the company that makes our previous Mirror stopped making it, so this looks like our best choice. It may have a longer lasting battery and that was a problem with my old mirror. it also has a modern charger cord, that’s a big plus. My old mirror had the old charger socket and it was really annoying. Pros and cons. I think I’d be happy if the on switch was on the magnifying mirror which is the one I use instead of the backside, which is really annoying to have to turn it over after you turn it on.

I think it works for what I wanted it to do.The install wasn\'t too bad, I actually didn\'t look at the instructions because I couldn\'t be bothered to look up the QR code in the ""instruction manual"". It took me about ~1hr putting it up solo. I wasn\'t too fussy about being a perfectionist, once I measured and place the first mirror I just used a spacer (my leveler) and eye-balled a lot of it. If I had another person to help, I could have put it up in ~40 minutes and I could have been more precise.Tip: once you have the adhesive on the back of the mirror, place one edge on the wall with the mirror ~perpendicular to the wall so the adhesive is NOT touching. Use your leveler or tape markings to make sure the edge is perfectly horizontal or vertical (depending on which edge you chose. If you have something to brace against this next part will be easier, for my I used my leveler. Pivot the mirror towards the wall slowly, watching to make sure the edges are lined up and gently press it into the wall. The adhesive tape is quite sticky and it will be difficult to make any adjustments once the adhesive is touching the wall.The instructions specifically say that the adhesive tape and the adhesive glue are both permanent, but you can get command line strips (sold separately) to make the mirrors removable.The mirrors are 1/2 - 1/4 the thickness of a typical bathroom mirror. They\'re thin enough that they can bend slightly, warping the reflection so the image will be slightly less than perfect. It\'s possible this is mitigated by using the glue instead of the tape, since the mirror will have little or no space between it and the wall - I used the tape.Also they give you plenty of adhesive, they sent me 3 tubes of adhesive glue and 2 pages of adhesive tape that are cut up into squares. I used 4 squares, one for each corner of the mirror, and had 60 squares left over, so you could easily put 8+squares on, but be aware that adjusting a mirror after placing 4 adhesive squares onto the wall was nearly impossible.Mirrors can be quite expensive, so I think the price is reasonable.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 29, 2023', 'is_verified': False}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars cute', 'author': 'Anna', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I love how it looks in my room, and was cheap and easy. be careful though because I cut my finger putting it up but that’s probably user error. also there are no instructions so I kinda guessed. anywho it’s cute and easy and cheaper than buying other mirrors.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States April 6, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '1.0 out of 5 stars FUN HOUSE MIRRORS', 'author': 'laura', 'rating': 1, 'content': 'These were easy to install, and the glass was definitely glass, however, they are all different types of glass.

This mirror has proven to be a valuable addition to my makeup routine, providing excellent lighting and useful features for flawless makeup application.Design and Build Quality:The design of this Hollywood-style makeup mirror is sleek and elegant, adding a touch of glamour to my vanity setup. The black finish gives it a sophisticated look that complements my room decor. The build quality is decent, and the mirror feels sturdy enough to withstand regular use. However, I did notice some minor scratches on the frame upon unpacking, which was a bit disappointing.Lighting:The lighting is the standout feature of this makeup mirror. The three-gear dimmable lights are fantastic, offering different levels of brightness to suit various lighting conditions. The LEDs provide clear, natural lighting that mimics daylight, making it easier to achieve a well-blended and balanced makeup look. I love that I can adjust the brightness according to my preference and the time of day.Smart Touch Control:The smart touch control is a convenient feature that allows me to adjust the lighting with a simple touch. It's responsive and user-friendly, making it effortless to change the brightness while in the middle of my makeup routine. However, I did notice that sometimes it requires a few taps to respond properly.360° Rotation:The ability to rotate the mirror 360 degrees is helpful, especially when I need to check my makeup from different angles. The swivel mechanism works smoothly, and I can position the mirror at the perfect angle for precise makeup application.Size:The 12-inch size is adequate for my needs, but I would have preferred a slightly larger mirror for a more comprehensive view. While the current size is suitable for makeup application on the face, a larger mirror would have been better for full-body outfits.Power Source:The mirror can be powered using either a USB cable or batteries, which is a convenient option. I appreciate the flexibility to choose between these power sources based on my needs and availability.Durability:As mentioned earlier, the build quality is decent, but the mirror frame could be more resistant to scratches and minor damages. I suggest handling it with care to maintain its appearance over time.In conclusion, the Lighted Hollywood Vanity Makeup Mirror with Smart Touch Control and 3-Gear Dimmable Light is an excellent addition to any makeup enthusiast's collection. The lighting is the standout feature, providing natural, adjustable brightness for a flawless makeup application. While there were some minor drawbacks, such as the size and potential for scratches, the mirror's overall performance and functionality make it a worthwhile investment for makeup lovers."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States July 23, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Love it!', 'author': 'will mccurdy', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Well built, just the perfect amount of lite.

Also, the mirror swivels up and down so that you can get a good angle, and there's a non scratch foam pad on the base, so you can easily slide it forward to get up close without scratching the surface of your vanity. The touch button feature for the three levels of light is neat, but the button is in on the mirror portion of the glass, so when you touch it with oily or makeup covered fingers, obviously it is going to get kind of nasty, but it's easy to wipe off. I have only two major complaints... Despite there being three levels of brightness, the first two are much too low to really bother with, so you always have to use it on the brightest level, and even that is arguably a little low, and the tone of the color for the light is in an unnatural blue hue, no matter what brightness setting you have it on. I have had to make sure to add plenty of natural, warm lighting in the general area-- I keep a small lamp on my vanity, and I really need to turn on surrounding lamps and an overhead light to make sure that I have proper lighting for daytime especially. If they had made sure that this light was more warm/neutral in color, and that the brightness level had gone a little higher, it would be ideal, but I am making it work with the surrounding warmer lights. Also, there is no magnifying portion of this mirror, so I have put a very small pedestal magnifying mirror to the side, and that has done nicely as well.

I recently dropped the one I’d had for many, many years, and the mirror shattered. This one is nearly an exact replacement. Local big box store currently only carries one with a small built in light (bulkier and the light is terrible), so I ordered this one, and am happy with it so far.Unfortunately, the tweezers, are not of very good quality. Although I wasn’t in need of them, I thought it would be nice to have an extra pair. However, after trying them, I will *not* be using them for personal care. I’m attaching a photo to compare the La Cross set I use (nearly daily) to these. The tweezers from this set have a flat, but rather sharp edge to the tips (grasping end), which causes more of a skin grab than just hair, and they pinch fat too easily. I tested them before the review, and although quite careful, I still feel irritation of the skin where I used these. It’s not simply because I was tweezing, as I pluck a hair or two from my brows almost daily, so I don’t get irritated like someone who isn’t accustomed to it. It’s solely because of the unrefined edge of these tweezers. When I took the photo of the two, side-by-side, it was evident why they feel so different. The La Cross pair are more angled on the inside and are polished, but still provide adequate grip. I hope the photo uploads at a decent enough quality to be able to see the differences. The ones from this set are on the left, and the La Cross set are on the right (you can see the paint wearing away from use).So, the ones that came with this set will be relegated to either the craft room or the tool box.

The packing was amazing and I had no fear that my mirror had arrived damaged. This was a great travel mirror to use. I first started off using this as my main daily mirror. The light function was very easy to operate and I loved that it had a magnet to keep the lid closed for storage. I did attempt to take this to the office with me but it was a bit large for my daily purse, so I had to change purses (I was not leaving the mirror behind). That being said I can see this as being ideal for travel where you have luggage space available to you, not so much a daily travel to gym/ work mirror. The mirror quality itself was amazing, very clear with no imperfections and the light did not take up too much real estate. I was worried at first that the light would be too bright to use but the dimming feature worked great to mimic my daily lighting. My con’s with this mirror is that overall it is about the size of a 2nd gen iPad, which does not seem “travel size”, and that it was too thick for my liking. If it was the same length and height but with a much reduced width I do not believe I’d think it was too big. I would have preferred something with the footprint of a kindle reader. But the trade off is that you get something a good working size that feels well made and not cheap, no one wants to do their makeup in a mirror the size of a compact! I do also feel that the finish will not look great over time, because it is so glossy I can see where scratches will start to form easily, I would have preferred a matte finish.

Stand is metal as well. Changing light modes is simple touch the little heart turns it on touching again you can cycle through 3 different color modes. I find it to be bright enough without blinding you when you are staring at it, since your face is pretty close to this to begin with.Only reason for giving it 4 starts instead of 5 is while it can almost stand vertically and has 180 degrees of adjustment, there is a point about 30 percent of incline where the stand and the mirror will slide folding onto itself and only stopping if the cord gets pinched between the mirror body and the stand. Not a big deal but if you push hard enough on the mirror to change the color, turn it on or off it will fold down. Some felt at the bottom of the mirror might help with that if you find theres a certain angle you need. Another reason that pushed this to the 4 star is while the light turns on only when it's plugged in (theres no battery) the connection on the back is a 5v cylinder plug type. It somes with the cord that can plug into any USB port to charge, just not the power block. So if you move this around often enough you will need to grab cord.

There's no reason at all togo with the theatrical version...Pity..."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States March 4, 2009', 'is_verified': True}]"

You just tap once for the first setting, tap again for the next, if you want, you tap once then hold and the light will either decrease or increase the amount of light for that setting.

Before with my unlighted mirror, I would need to turn on all the lights in the room and it still wasn\'t bright enough but with this, I have all the light that I need. Literally perfect.The only downside to this mirror is that it is harder to spin but that will probably loosen up with time since it\'s brand new. Personally I only use one side of the the mirror 99% of the time anyway.Assembly is really easy, just screw in the base.Weight is solid.

It literally gave me chills.To begin with I found the story of the three flatmates attempting to capture some spooky footage rather entertaining - they're all fantastic, very natural actors and the interplay between them was highly watchable. But as events started getting out of hand, as a result of the ominous mirror, I found myself being drawn into the chilling narrative to the point of feeling like I was watching a nightmare being played out on the screen. The 'found-footage' style evoked such a sense of dread that I felt like I was actually watching one of my own nightmares. The third act of the film is an absolute masterclass in tension, suspense and disturbing, unsettling filmmaking - and all achieved with no music score!I haven't had this kind of a reaction to a horror movie in a long time and it was really refreshing to watch something that actually scared me.

Also, the movie description initially made me a bit irked in that I thought the marketing team was claiming something about the film\'s popularity (I see some reviewers also missed this), but I see now - having seen it - that it wasn\'t a phony attempt at claiming the film was all-abuzz on Twitter, etc - it\'s actually part of the plot itself, not movie hype.The movie is filled with a long series of low-key spooky moments that add up to an overall engaging and ""believable"" found footage experience. All three actors were quite good and the ACTING was certainly on the level of any low budget found footage film I\'ve seen (and I\'ve reviewed around 50 of them so far) including Blair Witch and Paranormal Activity.It helps, bit, too, if you know about the long-standing $1 million prize offered by James Randi, as this forms the basis of the film, especially as to why the kids hang in the for as long as they do, despite the events unfolding around them (no spoilers)...I found it absolutely worth a rental, especially if you enjoy slow-build, b-horror, found footage movies and not thrill-a-minute films.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 31, 2015', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '2.0 out of 5 stars A Brief Inquiry into Horror Writing', 'author': 'Amazon Customer', 'rating': 2, 'content': 'So there\'s a concept in all narrative, but it\'s especially important in horror called ""the lock in"". It\'s when your characters are committed to the plot and can no longer just walk away from it at their convenience. The Blair Witch project, patron saint of these films has a lock in at a razor sharp 15 minutes in, though you don\'t know it until near the end when it\'s revealed that they can\'t leave the woods.Lock In\'s are important because they stop the audience from spending the entirety of the runtime asking ""Why don\'t they just call the police/hospital"". Hitchcock may have said \'they don\'t call the police because it\'s boring\', but he was also a genius working at the top of his craft. The rest of us mere mortals need to hold up the B and C movies with structure.I am, in general, pretty lenient towards found footage because it tends to pulpy by nature and thrown together by eager 20 somethings with about two thousand dollars between them. So I guess what I\'m saying is that I can forgive that The Mirror is 80 minutes of nothing happening followed by some Halloween store knife work - that\'s just what you *get* when you sign up for this sort of thing - but I can\'t find it in myself to forgive that the Lock In, the moment where the stakes are raised and people can\'t solve this issue by dialing the hospital doesn\'t happen until sixty holy crap minutes into a ninety minute film.Better luck next time.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 24, 2020', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '3.0 out of 5 stars Not the worst', 'author': 'Kindle Customer', 'rating': 3, 'content': 'but certainly not the best found footage out there.

I'm very pleased with the quick delivery.However....I just opened the package and can see that this Rucci mirror is not made nearly as well as my original one. The plastic is much more flimsy and light weight. There is only one wing nut, where there were two places with wingnuts for adjustment on the old mirror. I could really tighten the wing nut on my first mirror by using a screwdriver in the groove in the head of the screw to hold it firmly while I twisted the wing nut. The screw on the new mirror has no groove, so I can see already that this will be a problem.Thankfully, I also ordered another brand of neck mirror from Amazon that is made of metal. I plan to use this at home and use the plastic Rucci for travel, so it won't get nearly as much use as my original mirror did. I could not style my hair without this type of mirror, so am very glad to have found not only one, but two!I haven't yet received the metal mirror, so can't compare them, but I don't know if I would recommend the Rucci for everyday use. It doesn't look like it will last very long."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 16, 2012', 'is_verified': True}]"

As one who has a passion for social history, genealogy, and re-enacting, this work by Marlys Millhiser was right up my alley. I mean, to have the opportunity to travel back in time to meet one\'s ancestors, to experience life ""as it was,"" and to know what the future would hold not only for this person but for the world, well, it tends to make the imagination run. The trouble is, in `The Mirror,\' Shay Garrett had absolutely no interest in the past, much less wanting to live there. She all but ignored her mother\'s family history stories, and could have cared even less about the way folks lived 78 years earlier. But, due to a mysterious mirror, Shay - the very up-to-date modern girl of 1978 - unwittingly finds herself living the life of her grandmother, Brandy McCabe, 78 years earlier, in 1900.The author did an absolute tremendous job in her social history research, giving very accurate accounts of what life was like in the year 1900, from slow travel and modes of dress to tools, furniture, bed sheets, sicknesses (like consumption, of which Shay has no idea what it is), and types of foods, as well as slow speech patterns and language usage. And poor Shay (now as Brandy) must conform to that life as well as the mores and morals of a very different time, a time when females had very little say in their lives. Miss Millhiser has used her words and research to paint a veritable picture of the past. No easy task and pretty much a rarity from many authors.Part two of this novel shows the new life that Brandy McCabe - Shay\'s grandmother - must live. Since her granddaughter, Shay, has inhabited her body 78 years earlier, Brandy has now entered Shay\'s body 78 years into her future, in 1978.This second part of the book is a bit disconcerting - many different and unexpected avenues are taken that, at times, I questioned where the author was going. But, what Miss Millhiser did very well once again was to describe in vivid detail the awe and wonder that the 20 year old ""antiquated"" Brandy (now in Shay\'s body) feels in this futuristic world with talking picture boxes, disco bars, automobiles, electric blankets...heck, she even learned (through a TV commercial) that she should shave her underarms and legs!But Brandy, like her granddaughter counterpart now hopelessly living in the past, is not fond of this new (to her) world, especially with its lack of morals (as she knew them to be), scanty clothing styles (bare arms and legs!), and tasteless food.Brandy definitely has a tougher time accepting her new role as Shay with its freedoms in 1978 than her granddaughter does in her new role as Brandy in 1900 with its constraints, which is surprising. But, I feel it is probably more realistic - morals and mores in the past were much stronger and deeper than today and I feel that Brandy would not so readily accept becoming the modern woman of today, like many others might feel she should have.Another interesting aspect to the two stories are the way the author intertwines the two girls lives through the mysterious mirror - their visions of each other\'s events and reactions fit like a puzzle. While reading Brandy\'s story I was constantly referring back to Shay\'s story during the mystery mirror scenes (you\'ll understand once you read the book).And finally, the middle interim for daughter/mother Rachael became a vital connection to the two stories.Marlys Millhiser did a remarkable job spinning this time-travel tale. Considering that this is not your average historical/modern novel, I would love to know how long it took her, from her initial idea through historical research to penning and then finally to publishing.

Similar to the 1980 film Somewhere in Time, you don’t need a time machine to get a taste of the past. Unfortunately for Shay and Brandy, they get more than a taste!This is a story of two young women from the same family but separated by several decades of American “progress.” Shay is a free-spirited girl, whose ideas of sex and marriage would make any Victorian-era woman frump and fuss – and musical tastes as the Bee Gees might do that too.The story is actually the story of an Oriental mirror. Of unknown origin, it travels from one place to another, enticing its victims and makes itself known through the use of electricity and it’s many-fingered array along the edges of a very tall mirror. It hums and crackles with anticipation, pulling the viewer in to either (a) drive them insane to insanity or (b) switch them with others decades in the past or future.The author builds us up with a brief history of the mirror and also a major history of a family with its insanities, dysfunctionalism and crazy characters in the West – Colorado!Plots and Points:Shay is great as she tries to adapt to the past, wishing in some ways she paid better attention to her family history and American history as she confronts the Great Depression, the birth of twins and her own mother (yikes!) and the dawn of World War II (when was Pearl Harbor – December 11th or 7th? Oops).Most of the book revolves around Shay’s decisions: Will she mess up family history? What would Brandy do? Should she marry the man John McCabe wants her to marry? But Strock does not have the eyes that she has – or had. What of Rachael, her mother?Later in the book we get to know Rachael – a mother who loves her family’s past, struggles with a bad marriage, and now her mother just died in front of the wedding mirror. And now Shay is not herself. When Rachael discovers the truth, she goes a bit bonkers.However, the author does not develop this part of the story very much. Kinda drops Rachael as a main character and that’s just too bad. More could have been done there.The Brandy story is not as interesting – I think because we’re living where she’s living and can understand a person from 1900 not understanding disco or women’s’ rights or liberation. Not that interesting. Shay’s confrontation with her family’s past could lead to some unpleasant changes in her own future, so that adds tension and suspense to the plot.Meanwhile the Mirror continues to travel, affecting others through insanity and death. The horror aspect is not played up much – more of a historical fiction/fantasy story than a horror one.Bottom Line:Decent story, rolls along well with the Brandy/Shay/Rachael characters and how the Mirror affects them. Some dropped balls with the old man & his granddaughter, Rachael’s fate and a rushed ending with her future husband Marek.

There are some unexplained deaths in the book and a supernatural plot, but not real horror. It turned out to be much more than that.

The supernatural and time travel elements are definitely intriguing, but the characterizations, the writing style and the beautiful exposition of the life and times we\'re taken to are a wonder I\'ve rarely seen. Not surprising that this book was a sensation when it came out in 1979, and was the most stolen book in libraries as the time. I will not say much about the plot (which is as fascinating as the period piece), as that has been detailed extensively, already.

I was swayed by the many positive reviews, but in the end wasn't satisfied with the read. I'm not a paranormal fan, but that part of the story didn't bother me. It was the mechanics and conclusions that did.Pros: Intriguing concept. Imagine living in your grandparents or great-grandparents time. The book does a good job of painting a pretty realistic picture of the hardships, attitudes and advantages of an earlier time period. I liked that it wasn't romanticized. Conversely, imagine living in the future and trying to deal with unimaginable technology advances and a different belief system. Not easy. And again, the book does a good job of conveying the difficulty as well as the appreciation of some `modern' advantages. Imagine living in a body and a life that isn't yours. That was handled really well.I thought the author did a good job of keeping things straight in the different time periods and handling the discomfort the protagonist/s felt about a situation that seemed unbelievable, but to them was disconcertingly real.Cons: I found the pace uncomfortably choppy, with many sudden point of view changes that had me rereading a lot. Some parts were covered in great detail and had a good engrossing flow, while others were glossed over so abruptly, I lost my concentration and often didn't retain that information well. Consequently, when that tidbit was addressed later I had only the barest recollection of having seen it before, which jarred me out of the story. It seemed as though the author wanted to include too much--more than was necessary to tell the story well. Multiple very brief scenes seemed randomly stuck in almost as an afterthought. Some had value, but most didn't. I found that annoying, but perhaps those more attuned to the sound bite style of media today might not find it a problem. In that regard, this book seems to have been written before its time. It fits in better with today's preferences, which perhaps explains its resurgence of popularity. I also wondered if the manuscript had been overly long and edited down to pre-defined size a little too ruthlessly.I found the ending unsatisfying. There were loose ends everywhere and it was depressing. Supposedly, the story was about the mirror, but it wasn't really, it was about the two women, who for unexplained reasons were treated differently by the mirror than everyone else. I found the bits about the mirror incidental and unnecessary, as though there was conscious effort to make the story about the mirror when it wasn't.Obviously, to read other reviews, many really enjoyed this book. Perhaps paranormal fans are more at home with how some things were handled. Sadly, it just didn't work for me although I truly did find the concept fascinating, and read the whole book with interest (coupled with some confusion).

I was fascinated with it when I first read it and I still love it. But now, as a mother and grandmother, I appreciate it not only as time travel but also as tragedy and even (psychological) horror. The emotional implications of what a main character must bear are almost overwhelming. For both main character there are the requisite problems presented in time travel scenarios, living in and adapting to a strange time, but for for one, oh my.

It was not significant to me that Brandy and Marek didn't go further into the future. Now I would like them to develop their relationship, just as Shay did with Hutch. I guess Milhiser was seeing time as a corkscrew and Brandy and Shay switched places at parallel times in the continuum. But once Shay formed connections to the people and places in the pastime she realized she no longer wanted to return to her time. Milhiser maintained the device that Shay's mind was in Brandy's body and vice versa which covered the sticky problem of Rachel being raised by her daughter.

The premise was fascinating but the story was unevenly written. At first the whole timeline didn\'t make sense to me, until I realized that it was published in the 70\'s - and this also made me wonder if the author was maybe enjoying some herbal refreshment at the time.It\'s hard to even explain this crazy plot but I will try to summarize. In a nutshell, there is a mysterious and evil Chinese mirror that has been around for centuries, randomly killing people who look in it; or showing them scenes from the past or the future; or actually teleporting them around in time. During the mirror\'s tenure in the Garret family, it decides for fun to send Shay Garret, the ""modern"" girl, back in time to become her own grandmother. Shay\'s part of the story is quite interesting, with vivid descriptions of life in turn-of-the-century Boulder, Co. Even so, I had a hard time getting past the ""ick"" factor of someone essentially having sex with their own grandfather and giving birth to their own mother and uncles.I less enjoyed the story of Brandy, Shay\'s grandmother, who is transported to the future to become Shay. Her experiences could have been fascinating but the story completely derails here (following my earlier hypothesis, this may have been when the author graduated from weed to the harder stuff.) Shay - before Brandy inherited her body - apparently became pregnant. Fortunately, she is engaged to Marek, the father, who seems like a successful, nice guy who genuinely loves Shay. For reasons that are never explained or even hinted at, Shay\'s parents REALLY don\'t want her to marry Marek. Now that Shay has been acting ""crazy"" - because she is really Brandy, trapped in Shay\'s body and having trouble making sense of the situation and the modern world - when her parents find out about the pregnancy, they decide to have her committed and forced to have an abortion. WTF?? Shay/Brandy overhears the conversation where this is being decided, and she runs away.She somehow ends up living on a ramshackle farm with some old dude who lost his mind when his beloved wife passed away. He buried his wife in the backyard and names all his cats and farm animals after her. More WTF-ness.Shay\'s parents and fiance have been searching for her this whole time. Eventually they find her, and she gives birth to twins. Then inexplicably, despite Brandy having spent her whole time in Shay\'s world uninterested/repulsed by Marek, the novel ends with a completely out-of-nowhere sappy romantic ending.So I really don\'t know what to make of this crazy thing.

I did like the secondary characters a lot though, especially Thora K. I would have loved it if Millhiser had gone more into the backstory of the mirror, more than what was described in the ""backward."" And why does it kill some people but not others?This novel would be great for a book club. It\'s definitely discussion worthy. I might read it again in a few months to a year as I\'ll pick up on things that I may not have read the first time around.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States June 28, 2016', 'is_verified': True}]"

This allowed me to open the door, attend to some close-up grooming, close the door, and nobody would be the wiser because the mirror was attached to the inside of the door.Unfortunately, that old medicine cabinet went away in the remodel and was replaced with an in-wall, but doorless medicine cabinet. While we added three other medicine cabinets on an adjacent wall, the orientation of their mirrored doors (perpendicular to the wall in front of me) prevented my sticking my old magnifying mirror on the inside of one of those doors because I\'d then have to lean and twist my torso to use it, so no go. (In the interest of avoiding confusion with the magnifying mirror), I will hereafter refer to these mirrored doors as ""glass"" in this review.)The main options available to me were:- Wall-mount mirror: I\'d rather not poke holes in our brand-new walls.- Freestanding mirror: the vanity is small (like 24"" x 24""), so not a lot of free counter space.- Suction-cup mirror: I could attach it to the glass directly behind the vanity/sink.The third route seemed like the best one, so I ordered the 7x version of this item and, as usual, it arrived pretty quickly.I was a little worried that its suction cups might be flimsy, but they seem decent. I also saw some reviews questioning the magnification power and I don\'t even know how I\'d know if it was 5x or 7x or 6.318x, but when I test-fit things by holding the mirror up to the glass and leaning a little over the sink, I was pleased with the arrangement. I could see my nostrils and ears quite clearly and that was the plan.Side-note: before attaching the magnifying mirror to the glass, I gently rotated its three suction cups so that the little tab was near the circumference of the mirror. This would allow me to grab each tab when the time came to remove the mirror, whenever that might be.Another note: Before applying the three suction cups to the glass, I gently rubbed a small amount of ""oil"" from my finger on to each suction cup, as I believe that a super-light film of oil increases the quality of the seal the cup makes on the glass. Now that I reflect on it, I realize that might be an urban legend, but it hasn\'t fallen yet. (Admittedly, it\'s just been a few hours.)The magnifying mirror was reasonably priced and I see no flaws or distortion in the image. If the suction cups stay put for a while (I might give the entire thing a gentle pull every few months to see if it\'s about ready to give way), this item meets my needs perfectly.

It’s positively clean and NOT have any annoying branding or brand names anywhere on this mirror. It’s really lovely and a good value while looking chic on your vanity. I recommend this mirror 100%! (Old review, before the replacement): This mirror arrived today and I was quickly disappointed. There was a ""dead pixel"" black spot on the mirror that was a flaw - not on the surface, but deep within the mirror. This is a black spot where there is no mirror but just a literal black spot. Made me wonder about the quality control of this product. Next, after assembling and plugging it in, I found the light intensity button was useless. No matter what mode the mirror was in, the intensity did not change nor adjust. So no dimming nor brightening for me at all. Finally, when I tried moving the small 10X mirror from the surface to another area of the mirror, the plastic suction foot broke off from the 10X mirror.

I think it works for what I wanted it to do.The install wasn\'t too bad, I actually didn\'t look at the instructions because I couldn\'t be bothered to look up the QR code in the ""instruction manual"". It took me about ~1hr putting it up solo. I wasn\'t too fussy about being a perfectionist, once I measured and place the first mirror I just used a spacer (my leveler) and eye-balled a lot of it. If I had another person to help, I could have put it up in ~40 minutes and I could have been more precise.Tip: once you have the adhesive on the back of the mirror, place one edge on the wall with the mirror ~perpendicular to the wall so the adhesive is NOT touching. Use your leveler or tape markings to make sure the edge is perfectly horizontal or vertical (depending on which edge you chose. If you have something to brace against this next part will be easier, for my I used my leveler. Pivot the mirror towards the wall slowly, watching to make sure the edges are lined up and gently press it into the wall. The adhesive tape is quite sticky and it will be difficult to make any adjustments once the adhesive is touching the wall.The instructions specifically say that the adhesive tape and the adhesive glue are both permanent, but you can get command line strips (sold separately) to make the mirrors removable.The mirrors are 1/2 - 1/4 the thickness of a typical bathroom mirror. They\'re thin enough that they can bend slightly, warping the reflection so the image will be slightly less than perfect. It\'s possible this is mitigated by using the glue instead of the tape, since the mirror will have little or no space between it and the wall - I used the tape.Also they give you plenty of adhesive, they sent me 3 tubes of adhesive glue and 2 pages of adhesive tape that are cut up into squares. I used 4 squares, one for each corner of the mirror, and had 60 squares left over, so you could easily put 8+squares on, but be aware that adjusting a mirror after placing 4 adhesive squares onto the wall was nearly impossible.Mirrors can be quite expensive, so I think the price is reasonable.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 29, 2023', 'is_verified': False}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars cute', 'author': 'Anna', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I love how it looks in my room, and was cheap and easy. be careful though because I cut my finger putting it up but that’s probably user error. also there are no instructions so I kinda guessed. anywho it’s cute and easy and cheaper than buying other mirrors.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States April 6, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '1.0 out of 5 stars FUN HOUSE MIRRORS', 'author': 'laura', 'rating': 1, 'content': 'These were easy to install, and the glass was definitely glass, however, they are all different types of glass.

The mirror comes neatly packaged and well protected. You plug in the adapter into a pin on the back and off you go. The product outputs a nice uniform light at three different temperatures. The base is super sturdy, sits clean and flat.After a few uses, here are two things that could be improved -(1) The controls are on the mirror which makes that area a smudge magnet. They really need to move the controls off to the base or one of the legs.(2) The adapter pin (where you plug the adapter into the mirror) is on the back of the mirror.

This allowed me to open the door, attend to some close-up grooming, close the door, and nobody would be the wiser because the mirror was attached to the inside of the door.Unfortunately, that old medicine cabinet went away in the remodel and was replaced with an in-wall, but doorless medicine cabinet. While we added three other medicine cabinets on an adjacent wall, the orientation of their mirrored doors (perpendicular to the wall in front of me) prevented my sticking my old magnifying mirror on the inside of one of those doors because I\'d then have to lean and twist my torso to use it, so no go. (In the interest of avoiding confusion with the magnifying mirror), I will hereafter refer to these mirrored doors as ""glass"" in this review.)The main options available to me were:- Wall-mount mirror: I\'d rather not poke holes in our brand-new walls.- Freestanding mirror: the vanity is small (like 24"" x 24""), so not a lot of free counter space.- Suction-cup mirror: I could attach it to the glass directly behind the vanity/sink.The third route seemed like the best one, so I ordered the 7x version of this item and, as usual, it arrived pretty quickly.I was a little worried that its suction cups might be flimsy, but they seem decent. I also saw some reviews questioning the magnification power and I don\'t even know how I\'d know if it was 5x or 7x or 6.318x, but when I test-fit things by holding the mirror up to the glass and leaning a little over the sink, I was pleased with the arrangement. I could see my nostrils and ears quite clearly and that was the plan.Side-note: before attaching the magnifying mirror to the glass, I gently rotated its three suction cups so that the little tab was near the circumference of the mirror. This would allow me to grab each tab when the time came to remove the mirror, whenever that might be.Another note: Before applying the three suction cups to the glass, I gently rubbed a small amount of ""oil"" from my finger on to each suction cup, as I believe that a super-light film of oil increases the quality of the seal the cup makes on the glass. Now that I reflect on it, I realize that might be an urban legend, but it hasn\'t fallen yet. (Admittedly, it\'s just been a few hours.)The magnifying mirror was reasonably priced and I see no flaws or distortion in the image. If the suction cups stay put for a while (I might give the entire thing a gentle pull every few months to see if it\'s about ready to give way), this item meets my needs perfectly.

I LOVE the fact that with a ""long press"" with your finger you can dim or brighten any of these lights. I love the subtle circle on the mirror that you press to turn it on and off, and do the dimming, that is so neat and tidy to me. The size of this item is perfect by the way- not too small to be usable, and not too large to be transportable. It comes with a small magnifying mirror, with extremely strong suction cups (kind of hard to pull off actually once you press it on,) if you need to do any close-up make-up work, or correction, or plucking. I thought the light strengths on this mirror, either dimmed or full strength make it very versatile to be able to use in a darkened room, or even daylight. Just adjust as needed. The two things that I did not like about this mirror, was the ""latch"", I thought was cheap-looking, not reflective of this mirror overall, because the quality otherwise is great. The latch design could use some improvement, but isn\'t essential if it keeps the cost of this mirror lower, then by all means, it is fine how it is! I like the affordability of it at present. The charging port is on the back of the mirror, and the charging cord they include with this is pretty short, just be aware. The LED light on the mirror does not turn off when you close the case, you have to turn it off yourself before you close the case up. Some other lighted compact mirrors I considered selecting, were cute but they had the one side of regular mirror paired with an opposing side of a magnifying mirror, and whoever made it, put the LED lighted rim around the magnifying mirror, and not the regular mirror at all!!! So you are lit up from under your chin rather than the regular magnification mirror you are using, to do your make up with- so strange!! I passed on those.

You can basically adjust the 3 lighting modes each to a different brightness.I plugged the charging cord into my laptop and the mirror immediately started charging.

I am not someone who wears makeup on a daily basis, so the jury is still out on that part. I do agree with other reviews that the lighting options are a bit ""odd"" - cooler toned, I guess you could say - but I\'m comparing this LED lighted mirror to an incandescent style lighted mirror, so I think that is to be expected.It is simple to switch between the different light temperatures & to dim/brighten each one. The memory function works perfectly, too & carries over to each light temperature from what I can tell.It seems like a very sturdy mirror. The option to extend it upwards is a huge plus, as a lot of these types of mirrors on the market do not seem to have that capability. I do wish it came with some kind of magnifying mirror, but the suction cup kind would be easy enough to add on (just maybe not for travel). After comparing this mirror to another I own, this one actually seems to be 2x magnification, not 1x, which I personally appreciate. I also love that when folded up, the mirror itself is fully protected, because again, not all the ones on the market offer that.As for the slippery base that others mentioned, you have to peel the little protective stickers off the rubber pads. Once you do that, it holds a good grip.The only issue I have found, and maybe mine is just defective, is that it does not light up green/red when charging or to let me know the battery is low. This is rather annoying to me, since I never know if it\'s fully charged or close to dying. It leads me to wonder how long the mirror as a whole will last before it requires being plugged in full-time during use. Otherwise, I think this lighted mirror is an excellent option for travel or on-the-go needs, but maybe not an every day make-up mirror (for every day make-up needs, I would prefer something a little larger and with lighting options that were toned properly for different environments).', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 15, 2023', 'is_verified': False}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect for home & travel!', 'author': 'S.A.

I\'ve grown tired of finding a place to do makeup in hotels. Sometimes there are no flat surfaces near mirrors, sometimes there\'s space but dismal lighting, and sometimes I\'m crouched on a tiny desk in a dark corner. I managed to find a makeup bag (finally) that allows me to apply my makeup just about anywhere without losing my product, so when I spotted this mirror and realized it would fit in my new makeup bag, I was really excited.At first, I wasn’t certain about the brightness of this mirror. The initial setting leaves me with haloes in my vision and makes it difficult for me to see well enough to apply my makeup, but the dimmed lights (holding down the power button) are much better, and the device does hold the settings in memory, so that’s a bonus. The light tones are slightly ""odd,"" for lack of a better word. I have a makeup mirror in my room that does various light options like this, and the travel mirror is harsh in comparison. Every setting washes me out instead of mimicking environmental conditions; this may be better in hotel environments since I have only overhead lights in my house, so I’m reserving judgment here (my stationary makeup mirror swivels to avoid the overhead situation; this mirror can’t achieve that angle).The construction of the mirror is solid. It came charged, so I was able to test it immediately. The plastics seem sturdy, and the mirror closes snugly with a hard piece over the glass to protect it. The glass doesn\'t appear delicate and has no odd spots (wavers, ripples, etc.). The buttons are responsive and easy to press. I like that it can work as a stand unit or ""float"" in the air to achieve different angles and heights. This can be done with the mirror facing the base. Facing away from the base gives you the tallest height, which I’ll find most useful, but the downside is that the angle for this is mostly fixed and a bit too pitched up to be fully ideal. The hinges supporting the mirror’s movements work smoothly and easily, so props to the manufacturers for this. Most of the time, I have to struggle with this type of product.There are a few downsides to the mirror construction: 1) There are no rubber feet or similar textures on the bottom to prevent the mirror from sliding, and the plastic is very slippery. It slid every time I bumped it on my wooden table and dresser; 2) fingerprints practically cling to the mirror and are obvious as soon as they\'re present. Pack a buffing cloth if you get this, and 3) It’s a little heavier than I’d hoped, but if it lasts, I’m okay with that.I’m looking forward to trying it on my next trip at the end of the month! It looks promising, and I hope that bears to be true, but I’ll try my best to update my review shortly after either way.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 5, 2023', 'is_verified': False}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Nice Mirror A Little Bigger Than I Thought It Would Be', 'author': 'InExcelsis', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'This is a very nice mirror that has a ton of different ways in which you can set it up for use.

At first I had trouble getting the light to work, but then I realized that I was pressing too hard on the button and it works if you treat it like a touch screen. All the light functions do as advertise and can light up a pitch dark bathroom with no windows. For those worried about putting this in the shower, the battery pack has a seal in place to prevent water from entering from the back. The mirror does not steam up no matter how much steam is in the room. Adhesive works extremely well, almost too well. Practically impossible to remove it by hand and I needed to use a spatula to help remove it from the wall. The product comes with two adhesives so if you don’t like the first place you put it you have a second chance of putting it in the right place or you could place it in two different areas (like in or out of the shower) since the mirror itself hooks and unhooks easily off the adhesive.The only gripe I have with the product is that you can’t adjust the mirror 90 degrees to the left or right from the wall (dependent on placement). Unless it is placed on the very edge of a wall or on a pillar, it won’t be able to turn a full 180 degrees (90 degrees left or right of the wall). This is likely because the mirrors distance from the wall is about 2 7/8 inches and the smallest diameter of the mirror itself is about 6 5/8 inches (or 3.3125 inches radius).

This mirror has great features. It was packaged in a sturdy box and well-protected during shipping. The package was well organized and simple to open, and it was easy to follow the instructions given inside. The mirror has a shaver holder that can accommodate two shavers. I also appreciate how flexible, adjustable, durable, and sturdy the mirror is based on my experience. When you insert the back buckle into the adhesive hook, it allows the mirror to be attached to various wall surfaces according to your preference. This feature provides flexibility in where and how you use the mirror. You don't need to drill into the wall to install the mirror, making the process simple and less time-consuming. Furthermore, not having to drill walls to install a mirror like this helps prevent potential damage.To power the LED light, you'll need to insert 4 AAA batteries, as indicated in the user manual included inside the package. Yes, it notes on Amazon that you need to insert batteries, but it doesn't state the type, and you would have to find out upon receiving the box once delivered. I believe it would be beneficial for potential buyers if this information were included in the Amazon listing, not only in the instruction manual that's in the package. This way, they can be informed about the battery type required before purchasing the product. Furthermore, it's important to note that the mirror's lights are not powered by charging via a USB extension cord or by plugging them into a socket. Personally, I would prefer mirrors that offer recharging options over those relying on disposable batteries, especially for those on a budget. This helps reduce the need for frequent store visits to purchase replacement batteries. If you don't want the ongoing expense of buying disposable batteries, you may consider investing in a separate battery charger. Which comes at an additional cost, especially for those on a budget. I couldn't find a clear indicator or explanation in the user manual or on Amazon regarding how long the batteries would last while using this product. This lack of information means that I may have to update this review when I've had a chance to assess the battery life.In conclusion, based on my impression, due to the price and affordability, usage, and appearance, I'm giving it around four stars. This mirror offers many great features for its price, and it's a flexible mirror to use for many settings, making it a great affordable choice to have while practicing self-care."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 17, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Great product', 'author': 'Lisa G', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'A little smaller that I expected.

This one outshines them all!I am impressed with the overall quality and durability. There are two options for mounting the base. I opted for the adhesive rather than the screws because I didn\'t want to risk cracking my surround. I\'m always weary of adhesive mounting, even with a thorough cleaning of the surface, so we\'ll see what does, or doesn\'t, happen in the future but if for some reason it falls the mirror and the base, I am confident, will survive. It does appear to a good adhesive though.My bathroom does not have a light directly over the shower area, so the only lighting comes from outside through the blurry window. That would make me hold a mirror and adjust my head to shave by the window to get the best lighting I could on either side of my head, real annoying. The lighting on this mirror is fantastic, I really love it! Now I can stay in one spot and it works great, never felt like I needed to take it out of it\'s base to see better by the window.Now the real question, is it anti fog? Without a doubt, I will say yes. When I turned on the shower and the water got steamy it fogged up, but after a quick hit with water and turning on the heat function I never had a problem for the rest of my shower. I wish I had thought to take a quick video afterwards to show the comparison between this product and the bathroom mirror that was really fogged up. I love that there is a light indicating the heat function is on and working too so that there is no question.So, yes, this thing slides onto a base so you can take it out and recharge it. The charging port is well protected so moisture can\'t ruin it and the mirror slides over the base, rather than under it, ensuring it won\'t fall off.Another great feature is the tilting action. I love it has that this capability given as how everyone in my house will want to use this and we all vary in height. This will let us all use it.This is a fantastic product, highly recommend!', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 15, 2024', 'is_verified': False}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Hey! This is a nice fogless lighted mirror for the shower', 'author': 'Stella E', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I've tried other fogless mirrors for the shower/bath before that frankly just did not work - and were also battery powered and so heavy they frequently fell off the shower wall. This fogless lighted mirror from Suupvaor (which I tried through Amazon Vine) solves a number of problems, which I'll describe below. This a great option for men's shaving needs or (like me, a woman) doing a skincare routine in the shower.Pluses:* The mirror is charged via USB cable (no charging block, but everyone has one) so no need for batteries. * The charging port is covered with a rubber plug so no worries about water getting inside.* The fogless feature really works. I had the shower running for a minute before I remembered to turn it on, and within a minute, the mirror was clear. Yay!* I like the changeable LED light colors.* The separate wall mount means that you can slide the mirror off to recharge without taking the whole thing with you.* The adhesive patch that attaches to the wall mount portion of the mirror is STRONG. Make sure you get your application right, because it won't be easy to remove. Fortunately the manufacturer gives you an extra adhesive patch if you move or decide to use it in a different bathroom.* The built-in shelf accommodates a couple of razors plus room for other tools or a container of shave cream. It can be expanded, but I don't think I will use that function. The shelf has drainage holes for no mess.* The manufacturer includes a little pair of blunt-tip grooming scissors and a tweezer. I missed this in the product description, so finding them was a pleasant surprise.All round this is a very nice mirror for the price.

I was searching for a quality fogless shaving mirror for my shower and chose this one.I am very pleased with this mirror.These are the things that I like about this mirror:1.) Fogless: Many mirrors I have come across and even tried claim to be fogless but have fallen short for different reasons, including just not being effective enough. This mirror has a dedicated button to enable the mirror to resist fogging. I find that this is very effective, if the mirror happens to fog up because you forgot to press the button, it will quickly (within a minute or two) clear away the fog after pressing the button.2.) Lightweight: This mirror is very lightweight, even with a shaving cream can holder on it.3.) Mounting: There is no drilling into the wall to mount this, unless that is what you want. It comes with a sticky mounting pad already attached to the wall mount, just peel the paper off and mount the mirror in your desired location. It also comes with an extra sticky mounting pad and a couple of screws w/mounting anchors if you don't have the right surface to use the mounting tape.4.) Two-piece design: The mirror can be removed from the wall mount by just sliding the mirror up to remove it. The user's guide says to remove the mirror when charging.5.) Lighting: This mirror has a dedicated button to power the mirror on and that same button you use to choose from three different color temperatures. It comes with a charging cable (USB-A to USB-C), no power adapter needed, simply plug the USB-A side into a USB-A port and the other end plugs into the mirror.6.) Additional features: There is an adjustable shaving cream can holder and two holders for your razors.I am very pleased with this mirror and recommend it.I hope this helps."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 20, 2024', 'is_verified': False}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Well featured shower mirror', 'author': 'Prkie', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""The mirror comes with two mounting methods, regular screws with anchors and double sided tape. For most purposes, the tape will be plenty strong as the mount together with the mirror don't weight all that much and you don't have to put holes in your walls/tile. The only qualm here is that it would be nice if the mirror also had side to side tilt, but up/down is fine enough. Mirror can be removed from the mount for recharging. Mount is made out of very thick and substantial plastic, and has a folding shelf.The mirror itself doesn't seem to have a waterproof rating, but appears to be plenty waterproof for splashes. The USB-C port is covered with a gasket, and as long as it's facing down, it should be safe from any moisture ingress. Heats up fairly fast, and is truly fogless. Three different lighting temperatures.The main advantage to me is the massive internal battery. Most mirrors of this type have significantly less, or are not as resistant to moisture due to needing to have a battery compartment. Having this be a large rechargeable battery means less time spent recharging and swapping out batteries. Also, the USB-C port does charge via a C-C cable so the correct circuitry is included for futureproofing, even though an A-C cable is used by default.Other accessories are not very notable, but nice to have - small scissors and tweezers.Very recommended due to the great feature list and a reasonable price point."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 10, 2024', 'is_verified': False}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Brilliant Shower Mirror for Effortless Grooming', 'author': 'Humberto Marcano', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'This Lighted Shower Mirror has exceeded my expectations.

It pivots easily on a swivel mount, so it can be repositioned as needed to accommodate.The reflecting surface of the mirror seems of good quality - no distortions or warping - and it seems to resist fogging well.

I would stay away from sink and shower drains when assembling the mirror, just so you don't risk losing it.Also, I recommend using a small needle-nose (or other) small pliers.

The 'found-footage' style evoked such a sense of dread that I felt like I was actually watching one of my own nightmares. The third act of the film is an absolute masterclass in tension, suspense and disturbing, unsettling filmmaking - and all achieved with no music score!I haven't had this kind of a reaction to a horror movie in a long time and it was really refreshing to watch something that actually scared me.

Also, the movie description initially made me a bit irked in that I thought the marketing team was claiming something about the film\'s popularity (I see some reviewers also missed this), but I see now - having seen it - that it wasn\'t a phony attempt at claiming the film was all-abuzz on Twitter, etc - it\'s actually part of the plot itself, not movie hype.The movie is filled with a long series of low-key spooky moments that add up to an overall engaging and ""believable"" found footage experience. All three actors were quite good and the ACTING was certainly on the level of any low budget found footage film I\'ve seen (and I\'ve reviewed around 50 of them so far) including Blair Witch and Paranormal Activity.It helps, bit, too, if you know about the long-standing $1 million prize offered by James Randi, as this forms the basis of the film, especially as to why the kids hang in the for as long as they do, despite the events unfolding around them (no spoilers)...I found it absolutely worth a rental, especially if you enjoy slow-build, b-horror, found footage movies and not thrill-a-minute films.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 31, 2015', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '2.0 out of 5 stars A Brief Inquiry into Horror Writing', 'author': 'Amazon Customer', 'rating': 2, 'content': 'So there\'s a concept in all narrative, but it\'s especially important in horror called ""the lock in"". It\'s when your characters are committed to the plot and can no longer just walk away from it at their convenience. The Blair Witch project, patron saint of these films has a lock in at a razor sharp 15 minutes in, though you don\'t know it until near the end when it\'s revealed that they can\'t leave the woods.Lock In\'s are important because they stop the audience from spending the entirety of the runtime asking ""Why don\'t they just call the police/hospital"". Hitchcock may have said \'they don\'t call the police because it\'s boring\', but he was also a genius working at the top of his craft. The rest of us mere mortals need to hold up the B and C movies with structure.I am, in general, pretty lenient towards found footage because it tends to pulpy by nature and thrown together by eager 20 somethings with about two thousand dollars between them. So I guess what I\'m saying is that I can forgive that The Mirror is 80 minutes of nothing happening followed by some Halloween store knife work - that\'s just what you *get* when you sign up for this sort of thing - but I can\'t find it in myself to forgive that the Lock In, the moment where the stakes are raised and people can\'t solve this issue by dialing the hospital doesn\'t happen until sixty holy crap minutes into a ninety minute film.Better luck next time.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 24, 2020', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '3.0 out of 5 stars Not the worst', 'author': 'Kindle Customer', 'rating': 3, 'content': 'but certainly not the best found footage out there.

I'm surprisingly taken with this mirror - it looks really nice and there is no cheap paint to scratch when it's bouncing around in a bag. The size is just big enough to let you see your whole face but small enough to be very portable. I love that it has dual hinges (the single hinge on my past several compact mirrors has failed rather quickly). The magnetic closure is a great feature since the snap type closure on other compact mirrors also seems to break quickly (I'm looking at you, Conair). Most importantly, the hinge tension allows you to set it upright and angle it however you want.

Here\'s WhyHad to take off a star because the mirror itself was not at all attached to the back. There was dried glue on the back as if it should have been, but was not....don\'t know if it just wasn\'t pressed onto the back during assembly, or if a year or 2 of floating around on a shipping container separated it. Normally I\'d return it, but since that is more of an annoyance than just supergluing it myself, I\'ll just do that as nothing else was wrong with it.What ELSE do I hate about it (that ISN\'T it\'s fault)? This thing DEFINITELY performs it\'s 20x function! Why do I hate this? Because, although my 8x mag lighted makeup mirror crushed any delusion I had about my ""perfect complexion,"" THIS sucker downright destroyed the notion, so, while I\'m able to overlook the glue flaw on the product, those which it has made me see on my face cannot be unseen! I got this mirror to be able to pluck stray brows and be able to see my eye makeup application, which clearly it is perfect for, but the damage to my ego this mirror has inflicted will be eternal.As I said I already have one of those round, lighted, flip-2-sided (1x/8x) stand makeup mirrors, but the 8x was very lacking for what I needed, so I got this with the suction cups on the back, with the idea that I\'ll just stick it onto the face of the lighted mirror when I need it. I just stuck the back part (I did not glue the mirror yet), and believe me when I say that thing SUCTIONS like nothing else, so I have no doubt it will still do so when the actual mirror is glued back in. It is WORK to get those suckers off with care so not to break, so I will probably just leave it stuck over my other mirror\'s 8x side, since this one\'s (20x) actual mirror is so much better.As I stated my own current makeup mirror is lighted, this is NOT (and doesn\'t claim to be), but it works PERFECTLY how I want to use it, and fits just right on the surface of my lighted Conair stand one. PERFECT for close makeup application, plucking, or seeing that it\'s long overdue time for a face exfoliation/peel/moisturizing.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 28, 2022', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '3.0 out of 5 stars Suction cups', 'author': 'GrandmotherJ', 'rating': 3, 'content': 'No matter what I cleaned my bathroom mirror & the magnifying mirror with, glass cleaners, alcohol, lighter fluid it still fell off in a day or so.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States November 27, 2023', 'is_verified': True}]"

I purchased several others; most claim to be fogless but are not. Others are fogless for the first few uses, then they\'re not. However, this fogless mirror carries promise why because it does not use an ""ant-fog coating."" Instead it uses simple science and heats the mirror. I couldn\'t for the life of me understand why other mirrors did not do the same, especially when they\'re battery-powered anyway. I have only had the mirror for a day and used it once, but it has so far impressed me. The defogging feature works like a charm as long as you remember that it\'s a long two-second press to activate it rather than a simple tap. The light is very bright and allows for a clear unobstructed view. Despite the great experience so far, I have two critiques of this item. 1. it uses an adhesive to stick to the bathroom wall. It\'s 2024, and we should have suction options so the mirror can be moved when needed. Its a bit odd that an adhesive is still being used. The second critique is the use of the functions. Sometimes, I have to tap a couple of times before the device can recognize that I\'m trying to change the brightness.As I mentioned before, I truly do enjoy this item, I wish I had purchased the 3x zoom or 2x zoom for a closer shave, but overall, I am satisfied.

I put it up in the shower- NOT in direct water flow. It was under my showerhead and attached with the adhesion/glue with no problem. The mirror itself was awesome, light is very bright, and the anti-fog part worked really well. After only 1 shower, probably 5-6 hours after attaching it to a cleaned surface, with regular shower steaminess, I heard this CLUNK followed by what sounds like a quarter dropping and spinning till its flat, only WAY LOUDER. (If you have kids, you end up being an expert at what causes which noises)) I knew what it was before I went in to check. The mirror was on the floor of the shower, thankfully UNbroken. The attachment in the pictures was also on the floor. It seems that the rounded (weak point) that holds of the back of the screw broke, which put too much tension on the square adhesion and pulled off dropping the mirror. This sucks. I loved how it fit in with my bathroom and actually WORKED. I am going to figure out my own way to attach the stem, because I really like this. But you guys need to figure out a better way to attach something this heavy besides a small PLASTIC round doodad held on by a thin glue pad.

The base flipped around so you could use each side, but one of the positions didn\'t sit right, so it always fell over. During one of those falls, the mirror came off of the circular frame it was on. The frame actually split in half, so I had to glue it back around the mirror. Ever since then, I\'ll tilt it up so I can see my face, look away to grab some makeup, then before id look back, it would tilt back down to where all I could see was my neck. For a while it messed with me, I would think to myself, ""Was I slouching?"", or ""Did I move my chair forward by accident?"", ""Is there something haunting my mirror?"", or what I finally landed on: ""I must be losing my mind!"". Finally I caught it move out of the corner of my eye, because I heard it squeak at the same time, which was new. I realized I must\'ve bent the metal stand somehow, but I did such a good job super glueing it all back together, there was no getting it apart. So I got an LED mirror that accordians out from the wall, cuz I always wanted one, but realized where I do my makeup, there\'s nowhere to hang it. Then I got a suction cup one that lit up, which was great, cuz it NEVER fell over, but it was only a magnifying mirror, which messed with my vision if I wasn\'t an inch away from it at all times. Then the most recent one I tried was a rectangular, LED one that didn\'t magnify, but it had a weird leatherish flap, that was almost like a cover for a tablet, that bent in weird ways to hold it vertical or horizontal. Both of which were too far back, so if I got a pillow or sat on an old-school yellow pages, I might\'ve been able to pluck my eyebrows, but that\'s about it. Plus if you accidentally nudged it, it\'d fall flat over.Mind you, in between each of these mirror fails, id keep going back to Ol\' Squeaky, propping it up with various things on my desk.But finally, FINALLY, I got this one! (*angels singing*)It has two magnifications, which is nice, it lights up with 3 different kinds of lighting options (I never know which one to use, but as long as I can see what I\'m doing). The size of the mirror is good sized, so I can see my whole face no problem . Not that I have a huge face or anything, just my OG mirror had about a 5"" dia. And the most important thing, it has a nice sturdy base, So I\'d pretty much have to punch it for it to actually fall over, lmao. Oh and the button for the light is right on the base, which is nice. It\'s out of the way, so it doesn\'t get turned on by accident like the on-the-mirror buttons do. That can get pretty irritating too.But all in all, I think we finally have a winner!

The light is also not as bright as a couple of these mirrors I've had, but that just means it isn't blinding.The only problem I've had with it is that it will not stay stood up by itself for very long.

It stays in place when you position it. The surfaces are clear and unblemished. It has a somewhat slip free feel to the surface. - Slightly rubberized.Cons: Because of the way the magnifying side is shaped, it can be hard to find a focus point. Especially if you are trying to look at the side of your face (for example). It has no hole in the base for hanging on the wall, for a hook or screw. The pivot points are on the long sides of the rectangle - so it's more of an up and down view, than a side to side view. ( which I feel takes away from its usefulness ).I bought this as a replacement mirror. The mirror it replaced had a round magnifying side. I find the round preferable due to the even distortion around the sides. The magnification side on this mirror is rectangular, and the distortion is somewhat uneven.Over all not a bad mirror.

I was looking for something that was relatively cheap (broke college student :) ) and had its own lights, no cord, and wasn't too big because of low lighting, limited sockets and desk space in my dorm. This mirror seemed to check all the boxes and also had the benefit of the light being on both sides of the mirror instead of just one, so I chose this. It came in one day and the mirror inside was well packaged. There was styrofoam surrounding the mirror and the box was the perfect size for the product, which was great for me because it had became so easy for me to rebox it and put it in a suitcase for college and not worry about something breaking. It was easy to screw on the base and put in the batteries, but I struggled a little closing it after putting the batteries in. Note that it does not come with batteries but it only needs AAA batteries which are easy to get. I loved that the power “button” isn’t really a button but a touch switch kinda like the home button for iphone 7 and 8, it added a little bit of a fancy feel for the mirror. Lighting is perfect, not too bright and you can dim it if needed. Sometimes when the lighting is too bright it has warped my perception of the amount of makeup on my face, but this worked well. My only issue is that there is no indicator that you have dimmed all the way, you just have to hold the button and see if the light gets any lighter. Another thing to note is that if you dim the mirror and then turn it off, it will automatically turn on as the brightest light setting. I saw this as a good thing, built it really depends on your preference and it only takes a couple seconds to dim. Overall the mirror is great, and I would 100% recommend."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States July 15, 2020', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great mirror', 'author': 'Nancy', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Lighted, one side regular, one side magnified.

It is very heavy and stable on a surface and the light is super bright and lights up evenly and the mirrors are nice and clear and do not seem distorted at all. The mirror rotates freely to position as needed, but doesn't slip or turn out of place on its own (which has been an issue with other mirrors I've had). The switch to turn on the light is basically a touch-sensor, which was a little weird at first since there is no depress or feeling of touching a button, but I like it now because I feel like it will be more durable over time (not having to constantly push on one edge of the mirror) since you just have to tap the button lightly or gloss your fingertip over it and the light responds immediately.My only complaint is that each of the two mirror surfaces feel a little flimsy. Either the metal is very thin or its just metal coated plastic, but either way when taking the mirror surfaces apart (to put in or change the batteries) it feels very flimsy and like the whole thing could snap in half. When all is assembled though, it is sturdy and I would still 100% buy again even with this very minor complaint."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 12, 2021', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Alright', 'author': 'Alexis', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'EDITED***So they reached out to me and offered a refund which was very nice of them.A few other things, the mirror is a nice good size with good magnification for doing makeup.

When I first got this, it came very well packaged and was easy to put together. The brightness was good also with brand new batteries. Unfortunately, a few issues have come up...I dont use it that much maybe 5 to 10 minutes about 4 times a week but the batteries do go down fast. After a month the light is very dim sadly, so you will use a lot of batteries. Also another very very very annoying thing is that it keeps coming apart from the base (the stand will separate from the base) the screw does not seem to be long enough and might be a little striped. I hardly move it but it does this often.So I actually wish I got the ihome and probably will in the future but for now it still works nicely as a mirror sans the light.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States April 7, 2020', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Light not bright', 'author': 'Traci Teichmann', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'The light is not bright.

After I wrote the last update I contacted the company and they were great. They sent me a new mirror in about 1 day (don't know how that happened but I got it the next day (but they are only in the next state)). Anyway, the new mirror works fine and I'm very pleased with it. So I do recommend this mirror after all.I'm just adding an update to my prior review. About two weeks ago, the light started flickering when I turned the mirror on - eventualy the light stops flickering, but even so, it's not as bright as it was. The right bulb looks about ready to blow out - the top 1/5th is not lit. I tried to return it, but the 'return window' is over and I couldn't find a number to call to complain.I just wanted to warn would-be buyers. I'll stick with stores like Costco next time that have a better return policy.This was my prior review.I purchased this mirror about 1 month ago and have used it daily since. I am very happy with this purchase. It's not quite as large as it looks in the pics, but it's still a very nice size.I've had lighted make-up mirrors for a very long time. I would rate this the best for several reasons.1. I keep it propped open on a dressing table. I think it is very sturdy. As I recall, the piece that props the mirror up is the most flimsy (in other models) and one of the first things to go. This feels solid and there are two pieces used to prop it up.2. The lighting is very good. You have the ability to choose Day, Home, etc., but I generally only ever use Day.3. I especially like the fact that it has two side mirrors so you get to see the parts of you that you never see (and maybe never want to see:)). I've had compliments lately on how I look and I think it's because I apply better make-up.4. The reverse side of the mirror has 5X magnification, and it likewise is a very good mirror - not distorting as I sometimes find magnification mirrors to be.I read some of the other reviews before purchasing but I don't find some of them to be true. The light turns on with a switch very easily; you don't have to press and hold. I've seen that in other models but not this one. Perhaps the manufacturer improved the product since the first reviews were written.All in all, I'm very satisfied with this purchase and I would recommend it to anyone. I believe it is a quality product and I think it will last - it's sturdy, solid and seems to be made of good materials (not flimsy)."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 24, 2010', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Exactly what I wanted!!!', 'author': 'Wendy Palmer', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I ordered a different one and shipped it back because the side mirror like 4”x4” was the magnifying mirror.

Showers', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'How do you take the Jerdon Model JGL9W apart?DO NOT TRY TO PRY IT APART! That will NEVER work. I tried that. That is some tough plastic. I found out that the back is not made to simply pop off. And no amount of prying will get it off. The unit is held together by four (4) rather substantial screws.Where are the screws? On the back of the unit you will see four (4) round slightly recessed areas. The recessed plastic inside of these four circles hides the screw heads. If you take a medium size phillips screw driver and press it into the center of that circle you should penetrate through the 1/16 inch or so of the covering plastic, and find the screw head right underneath.(I used the word ""if"" and ""should"" because I removed the plastic with a 5/16 inch forstner bit on my drill press, not knowing what was under there. I thought it was a support post, internally glued, and I was going to separate it from the back by removing the plastic material around it. But, to my surprise, the drill bit hit metal quickly, and in that way I found the screw head.)Note: Before you seperate the front and the back of the unit, use the flat end of a screw driver to pop out the slider knob.With that caveat, when you get those four screws out, the unit comes apart easily.Why did I take it apart? This unit worked fine for one year, and 11 months, wherein, it came to pass, that both of the lights stopped working. Even if you held the switch down for a minute the lights would not light.Now, because both lights would not light, I figured it was probably not an issue with the lights themselves. I thought I might find something wrong with the switch. When I had the unit apart, and I plugged it in, I operated the switch, and it had a different feel to it, it clicked on, and it clicked off. Before I took the unit apart, the switch had no such mechanical feedback. I am not sure what I did to invoke that change in behavior. Nevertheless, I was rewarded for my efforts, as is often the case in situations like this, where you make the effort, but you are not sure exactly what you did to make it work, but by golly, both the lights come on now!And so, if I had not broken one of the small brackets that holds one end of one of the lense movement assemblies during my effort to pry the unit apart with a big screwdriver, I could simply put it back together and give it back to my mom, as the lights appears to work fine now. But because of this broken bracket issue I need to figure out how to glue it back on before I can put it back together. I don\'t see a major problem there. (Update: that was no problem. I made a new bracket, glued it on, and the unit is reassembled and functioning properly).While looking inside this unit, I must report to you, that it is well made, and quite substantial. I think people who buy this unit are getting a good deal. All electrical connections are made with solid crimp connections, and everything is well insulated. The ballast transformer looks to be so substantial that one might expect it to last for a century or more. And the lense movement assemblies are quite cleverly and substantially designed too.For those of you who want to know how to change the fluorescent light bulbs in this unit, i.e. if they ever did fail, well then, you would take the unit apart as described above. Beyond that, the rest is speculation on my part derived from looking at the issue from the inside. As noted I did not need to replace the bulbs in this unit.Inside the case, on a label close to the bulbs, it tells you what kind of bulb you need. However, the bulbs do not have sockets. They are hard wired in there with crimp connectors. To remove the old bulb or bulbs, you would have to clip the wires close to the bulb pins, remove the old bulbs, and put in the new ones, and then crimp the wires back onto the pins of the new bulb. I suppose you could solder the wires on, using some shrink wrap insulation to make sure that there is no bare metal showing after you are done.For a person to accomplish this successfully, you would need to have some electrical knowledge before hand. Not a lot, but some. Like don\'t work on the unit while it\'s plugged in. And how to crimp, or solder, and how to insulate the bulb pin connections. And how to keep track of where the wires go. You could take a digital photo first, before you disconnect anything.Moreover, the replacement of the light bulbs would be further complicated by the fact that these light bulbs are mounted inside of the lens movement mechanisms. It appears that the main mounting bracket (one per side) for the lens movement mechanism must be unscrewed and moved at least partially out of the way before you can get your hands on the phenolic strips which serve as the mounting structure for the bulbs, and through which the pins extend. I poked around in there and tried to see how these might come out. It is not clear. It Looks like somewhat of a mechanical puzzle. And when it comes to the lens movement mechanism, we are speaking about a string driven spring loaded apparatus, and it will take some mechanical aptitude to get it put back together and properly realigned, that is tracking from side to side.(To adjust tracking, you need to relieve the string tension on one side, and spin the lens into the proper position. I needed to do this before I put this unit back together.)Replacing the light bulbs in this unit is not impossible. But it would NOT be considered easy. Apart from the time it would take to find the right replacement bulbs, and have them at hand ready to install, I think you would be talking about a couple of hours of shop time, factoring in the time you will need to explore and fathom just how to get the old bulbs out of there.A factory technician who has done this a hundred times, who has the bulbs, the tools, and the experience, might be able to complete the job in about fifteen minutes. A person who sees the inside of this unit for the first time will take longer.If you are electrically and mechanically inclined, and have the time to spare, it might be an enjoyable project, which would pay some dividends, I think, in terms of making the end-user very happy. Giving new life to an old friend will certainly give her something to smile about.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States March 27, 2011', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars It works well, I just hope it lasts, it is quite wobbly.', 'author': 'Deborah Jasper', 'rating': 4, 'content': ""The mirrors are good.

It helps make online shopping so much easier to know what you are getting.This morning my husband and I had a discussion about mirrors. I just turned 55, just got my first pair of real, full-time, long overdue, eyeglasses to replace those reading glasses I have lived in denial with for so long. For a little makeover I got a new hairstyle and, with my new hair and glasses look, I now want to spruce myself up and start wearing makeup more often again too. I discovered though, that you couldn't wear the glasses and apply eye makeup. So I was back to where I was before, not caring about putting on makeup because I simply can't see to apply it. I mentioned, to hubby, I now needed a magnifying mirror.This got started when my husband was looking for a hand-held mirror (for another, non-grooming reason) this morning. At that time I also remembered that back in the late 60's and early 70's, my mom had given me a, variable lighted, standup, swiveling, magnifying, makeup mirror, similar to this style. I think it was a GE brand. I loved it. They were a popular item back then. Today it seems they are hard to find, with only a few models made anymore. I had lost track of that mirror and hadn't thought about needing another makeup mirror until now, 40 years later!The real clincher was that hubby also said he'd always thought it would be great to have a mirror for shaving. (I'm not sure whether he meant tilting or magnifying or both? Yes, of course, we have a regular mirror on the wall we have always used!)I hunted this mirror down on Amazon and the price was right with free shipping. I looked at the Conair model (Conair also has one without the side mirrors). A reviewer mentioned a Jilbere brand. I looked at those too. The Jilbere's were more expensive and the Conair could be had for about $9 less than this Jerdon one. But reviewers convinced me that the Jerdon was better lit. I'm not sure hubby ever considered or knew about mirrors being lit at all, but when he sees it, I know he's going to be a stickler about the lights being bright enough for him. I also know, at my age, how I'd like nice bright lights too. This made the little bit of extra money for better lighting well worth it.I also read a review of the Conair (somewhere, maybe not even Amazon) that complained that the center mirror swivel should be horizontal to tilt without having to adjust the mirror stand, and not vertical. I suppose you can look at it both ways though. The Conair is adjustable horizontally on the mirror stand AND swivels vertically. Maybe the dual action, even if a little more inconvenient, is a plus for you. I opted though, through reading the Jerdon reviews, and the picture showing the horizontal tilt (very helpful), that this made more sense. The Jilbere appears to swivel vertically. (My old GE swiveled vertically, as I remember, and I vaguely recall thinking it wasn't my favorite feature to have to adjust the stand for the horizontal tilt.) I figured the vertical angle views could be adjusted enough for my needs on the side panels. Although the side panels are not magnified (side panels are not magnified on any models at all) this still seemed like the one for me.Pictures of it in different views, especially the closed up view, also revealed that it was styled with clean lines that hubby would like and wouldn't seem like too much of a feminine appliance.I have to laugh though. Hubby indicated a round standing mirror with his hands when talking about it. Oh my, I looked at the hundreds of those babies that are available now. My personal opinion of them is that even the nicest ones look like a chintzy little utility tool item (albeit handy) that was made in China and you got from Fingerhut. The mirror floating in space (but necessarily supported by some apparatus) style just turns me off. There are a few modern looking rectangle, freestanding and wall mounted jobs but they are always more expensive than they I'd care to pay and, in my minds eye, don't look a whole lot different than the little round ones. No matter how they dress it up they just look like a time worn, antiquated (albeit handy!) design. It's sort of like a toaster. There's not much you can do with a toaster that makes it so significantly modernized and updated that it doesn't still look much like any toaster that was made 50 years ago.In reality even the cheapest unlit round ones are ridiculously priced for such small little viewing areas. Forget the designer lit ones with fancy frame and base finishes. They run in the hundreds of dollars! Unbelievable! I also read that the lights are often specialized and irreplaceable. They are often battery operated, no thanks. Features like dimming, color change, or an outlet on the base, wall mounting brackets ect... make the itty-bitty things incredibly pricey. Give me a makeup mirror that looks like an official appliance and doesn't cost an arm and a leg, instead of a cheap looking tool that cost more than my microwave oven! Maybe hubby didn't know they had these big mirrors. I did because I remember my one from the good old days. He's going to love it!Oh, and many thanks to the reviewer that explained about holding the light switch a few seconds. It doesn't bother me to do that and, if I remember correctly, I think I had to hold the switch on my old GE mirror too. One of the first upfront reviews I looked at was the one about the bulbs burning out but the other reviewer, favorably clearing up the mystery, eased my mind. Great piece of advice, instead of thinking the bulbs don't work. When I got the thing I did spot the note right above the button, explaining the holding of the switch also. Some people never read labels though.My next challenge is that those stupid little round mirrors would have fit much better on my tiny little bathroom vanity countertop a whole lot better than this rig, but I'll make it work somehow. After all you can close it up and store it, and those little round ones are pretty much destined to sit on the vanity top all the time."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States July 23, 2008', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Great Mirror', 'author': 'Laneysni', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'The mirror is a good size.

The build quality and luxurious materials used are high grade. Overall, the Sapira is a class act.Day 1: The mattress arrives in a tall square-box, about 2x2x4. I attached a photo of what the mattress looks like compressed inside the box. Upon placing the mattress on my boxspring, I cut the plastic off and the bed immediately sprung to life, literally, as the coils decompressed. Yes, there is a noticeable off-gassing smell, but it\'s not offensive. I left my window open at night, and 90% of the smell was gone by the next morning.Day 2: At first, the mattress was a bit firm, but after about 24-36 hours the mattress had fully decompressed and was much more comfortable. It\'s probably a 6.5/7 out of 10 on the firmness scale, the way most online professional mattress websites suggest. The top Avena foam layer sleeps cool, so I don\'t overheat. The bounce the Avena foam + the pocketed coils provide makes moving around, and getting out of bed effortless. The off-gassing smell is just about gone now.Day 3: Decided to get rid of my old mattress and keep the Sapira. I sleep mostly on my back, but sometimes on my side and stomach throughout the night. The only sleep position I thought wasn\'t going to work out was the side position, because of the firmness, but the 3 inches of Avena + memory foam actually provide just enough sinkage, while keeping my spine aligned. The off-gassing smell is completely gone now. I bought a mattress protector, and then my bed sheet goes over that to complete the package.When I bought this mattress last Sunday, there were 20 left in stock with Amazon. As of this morning, only 9 Queen-size beds were left in stock, while some sizes other than Queen were already out of stock. So clearly word is getting out about this mattress. At $1,325, it\'s also a lot less expensive than every other hybrid mattress on the market, most of which will cost at least $2,000 more than this one, and will require you going to a showroom, and taking time off work to be home for delivery.In conclusion, I highly recommend this mattress. Please feel free to ask me any direct questions on here. Also, if you have time, I recommend reading the review on Sleepopolis, as it\'s the most comprehensive professional review that matches my own experience.Update: although I bought a Claritin mattress protector, and although when I called Sapira customer service they recommended having one too, I removed it on Day 4. It added a ""plastic"" feel to the surface of the bed that became unbearable. Once I removed it, that initial softness I experienced on Day 1 came back again. I only intend to use just my bedsheet from here on out. I recommend you do the same.((On a side note, I suggest ignoring the only other two reviews on here, both two stars. Unlike myself, neither one is a confirmed buyer of this product. The first review is too short to be real for a legitimate mattress evaluation by an actual customer. The fact that this mattress has the firmness rating it does shows the Sapira is designed for superior back support, so the reviewer\'s complaint is illogical. The second review is also partially off topic, as they discuss the manufacturers\'s website, which has nothing to do with how the mattress feels. Yes, they are correct the mattress is a little firm, but every other online review already confirms this. So to slam the product with only two stars for performing how it was designed is unfair.))', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 2, 2017', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars good quality and definitely med firm', 'author': 'KC', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I've slept on this mattress now for a week and am very pleased with its level of firmness.

The nice part about the Leesa is the memory foam top, so you get a softer feel while still enjoying a medium firm mattress. It’s even perfect for my lighter body weight and the boyfriend thinks the firmness is satisfactory too. We are both happy.The one thing that has taken some getting used to is it sleeping cooler.

Maybe because my body is just too used to the firmness and bounce of inner spring mattresses, this memory foam hybrid caused pain in my back and hips so bad that I never slept through the night during the trial period. Some reviews say this mattress is too firm, but I found it too soft. Lying on my back, I could feel my butt sink down into the foam a good 3 inches; lying on my side, my hips would also sink down that far, pulling my spine out of alignment. Yes, the memory foam ""bounced"" back to normal once I got up, but that didn\'t help while I was lying down! Also, as someone used to moving around easily on an inner spring, moving around on this mattress also created pain in my back and sides since the memory foam basically ""immobilizes"" you.To Amazon\'s credit, they issued a full refund when I requested it, efficiently and quickly without making me go through a lot of paperwork or red tape.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 16, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '2.0 out of 5 stars Arrived mishappen.', 'author': 'Kathleen M.

I contacted Amazon & they immediately ordered a replacement. That was on February 15th. Amazon said it wouldn’t be here until February 22nd & we were okay with that. Well it ended up showing up on February 17th! We were so excited. The box is heavy so it’s easier for 2 people or someone super strong to carry. My husband got it upstairs & unpackaged which was super easy to do. It almost immediately inflated but we gave it about 12 hours to sit. Last night we slept on it for the first time & omgggg love it. It’s definitely firm which is what my husband wanted but still soft. The memory foam is great & makes you feel cradled as you sleep. It pops right back up pretty fast too!

So I thought I’d order this to try out foam because my spring mattress was over 10years. This one is a good price to test and had good reviews. So I got the mattress. I was very skeptical and worried the whole time I let it opened to decompress. It had no problems forming into its shape in about 6 hours or so. I allowed it to air out standing instead of flat. It really had no smell. I put my nose to it and thought my eyes got itchy after but maybe it was from something else. So no odors and no problems with its shape. So finally I slept on it. And I guess since I’m not use to foam it felt really weird. It feels like you’re stuck in every position you move into. But I guess that’s how it is. It has a sinking feeling but I guess that is also how it is. I woke up actually feeling really good and like my back was straighter. And I ordered 8 inch and it indeed shaped into 8 inches because I measured it. It seems smaller but it’s not compared to my old mattress that is also 8 inches. Ok so my reason tho for 4 star is because the material is polyester which you can’t find in the description. Polyester is really bad for your hormones but it seems they make everything out of plastic nowadays. I researched organic brands and basically anything labeled organic vegan etc is just greenwashing. All foam mattress are processed with tons of chemicals. They have to. It’s a science in order to turn fibers into all the crazy things they make. They will then add some essential oils at the end to call it organic. Overall this is a wonderful buy for toxic mattress because they all are. It’s a lesser evil. It’s very comfortable in a stiff odd sinking way. I bought some cotton sheets to help balance things out.

I had a spring bed with a pillow topper for 15 years. I was used to it, it did the job. I knew my bed was nothing special but I knew I could do better. When I finally ready to move out, I knew it was time to get a new bed. I\'m fresh out of college so I knew I wouldn\'t be spending $800 on a mattress. And everyone says ""you spend half your life on a bed, make an investment!!"" Well that was true 10 years ago. Now, we can buy vacuum sealed beds on Amazon for 10th of the price of a Tempurpedic bed. There\'s so many these days, I needed to do my researchWhy Zinus?Through my deliberations on WHICH bed in a box I would purchase, it was between this, Casper, Purple and I think some other $500+ one. I wasn\'t considering the Amazonbasics one because it seemed very very generic and bare for my taste. Casper and Purple have great marketing and I see the ads all the time on the subway and on the internet. Reading some reviews, I saw that they might be a bit too firm. That lead me to Amazon where I found Zinus. The bset reviews say...well, its the best. The worst reviews are people who opened them up and got covered in fiberglass. Figuring that I wasn\'t going to open it up, I chose this one. It looks nice, the material of the case seems comfy and the alleged ""green tea"" will help me sleep better. Also, the bedframe I bought was also a Zinus so I figured that they would pair up better (spoiler: not really lol). Finally, it was only $279!!The first 2 daysThe box comes in the mail. It\'s pretty damn small for how big a queen mattress is. I\'m not tall by anymeans and I was able to bear hug it up the stairs to my apartment. Out of the bag, I placed it on the bed frame. I let it breathe for a day with the windows in my bedroom cracked open before sleeping on it. (Yes, it smelled for the first day. The next day, a bit less. I believe within a week, there was NO smell left. I understood this would happen before I made my purchase and I will NOT be factoring it into the review because we\'re all adults and we will get over the smell without calling the bed trash.) 24hrs later, the bed had blossomed to around 12"" in most parts and 10"" around the corners. My girlfriend always says ""10"" is fine"" so I lay on the bed for the first time and woah... this is the comfiest bed I\'ve ever layed on. My back didn\'t hurt, I was in bliss. The first sleep, I woke up so refreshed. I had NO complaints. Even my cat was on it all night and he usually gets up and goes on the move.Day 3 and beyond (6 months in total)Since day 2, not much has changed. The bed has retained it\'s shape. It wasn\'t broken in on 1 side and virgin on the other. The corners never really took shape but I\'m not sure if this is due to the sheet I have over it. There is an element of body heat absorption which will have you wake up a bit sweaty. I recommend getting a lighter blanket or bamboo sheets to help with this. I did both and I don\'t sweat anymore. It\'s been 6 months of great sleep for me. Oh yeah, that green tea extract line is BS. I don\'t smell it, never did and I don\'t think it\'s what causes me to feel calm in bed. I think that the comfort is what makes me happyOverallOverall, this bed is absolutely worth it, every single penny.

Comfortable for 2 fat people and 3 dogs.', 'author': 'Zooper', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'EDIT: 3 month update.....I\'m still leaving it at 5 stars. We have now had this mattress for just over 3 months and still love it. I am falling asleep faster, staying asleep and waking up feeling more rested. I have slept on both sides and even in the middle of the mattress and have equal comfort anywhere. I normally have 3 dogs hogging the bed and what\'s really nice is I barely notice if they get up and move to a new spot, even if it\'s right next to me. I no longer feel like my husband is doing backflips if he turns over in the middle of the night either. Even the one night the mattress pad didn\'t make it into the dryer in time for bed I did notice the difference the mattress pad makes in not making this mattress feel as firm, but it was still quite comfortable, just not as comfortable. I have no complaints. There were no smells with ours to start with so that never was a problem and it\'s still at a full 12"" evenly across.I\'m in the camp of those who were really skeptical of buying a mattress online. Especially a foam one since I\'ve had a regular pillow top one for the past 10 years. Yes it was time for a new mattress! I had been shopping around for a new mattress for a few months trying out different ones, getting pricing and trying to make a decision which is kind of a big deal when you\'re more than likely looking at spending a lot of money. A friend suggested we consider the foam mattresses and that Amazon had some good prices on them. I headed to a local store to give their version of these mattresses a try and I was surprised how comfortable they were. After testing them out I decided to see what Amazon reviews had to say about the ones they offered. I read through the good and the not so good and the flat out bad reviews and decided to take a chance and see what arrived. I am super happy I did! Granted it\'s only been 2 weeks but so far we love this mattress! I had read the multiple reviews saying theirs didn\'t inflate correctly, had a foul odor, was lumpy, etc....thankfully none of that was true of what we received.To break it down.....cons...It is a firm mattress no doubt. I am someone who likes to pretty much sleep in a cloud and am a side sleeper so it\'s taken some getting used to. Since the cost of this mattress was so good I went ahead and ordered a high quality mattress cover/pad and for me it\'s really helped make adjusting going from a plush pillow top to a firm bed a lot easier.Going from a spring mattress to a foam ones takes some adjustment on the support on the sides. Obviously the spring ones tend to have more of a frame around the edges so sitting on the side of the bed is different. I wouldn\'t say it\'s bad but it\'s not as supportive.We will probably need to get a new bed frame here sometime soon. While the box springs we had from our old king are still in great shape the lighter weight mattress tends to slide and needs to be shoved back into place every night before going to bed. Not really any fault of the mattress it\'s just a con that I\'ll need to replace the bed itself in order to stop this from happening.Another con that\'s not the fault of the mattress it\'s just my bad luck....I missed where this was on sale just after Thanksgiving because I was still pondering what kind of mattress to get. So I paid the higher, yet still on sale, price. 4 days later it went back on sale again and has remained $40 cheaper for over a week now. Bummer for me, but still a good deal, just not as good of a deal as if I\'d waited 4 more days to decide.On to the good stuffPros.....Per my experience I say buy this mattress. Don\'t wait, grab it at the price it is now. I did not notice any sort of foul odor but I did open the windows and had the ceiling fan going while it inflated.It inflated to the full 12"" and did so within an hour. We were sleeping on the mattress withing 4 hours of setting it up. It fit where our old king size was perfectly with no overhang or shortages size wise. It\'s around 2"" taller than our old mattress so that took a little getting used to but it measured 12"" with a regular school ruler.It was well packaged and fully deflated ready to go when it arrived.I\'m a big girl and my husband is a fairly big guy and we both sleep comfortably on this mattress with our 3 large breed bed hogging dogs. When my husband moves at night he does so like a fish out of water and I have noticed he doesn\'t wake me up turning over because it\'s not bouncing me around like our old mattress did. I don\'t even really notice a dog moving around to a different spot.I\'m a side sleeper who would love to sleep in a cloud so this did take some getting used to but it\'s never been uncomfortable. The first night getting to sleep and finding a comfortable position took a little bit but I could instantly feel I was better supported and my hip and shoulder didn\'t have the pressure it normally would. When I turned onto my back I felt almost like I was sleeping in a hammock. Not totally of course but the extra support was there where it hadn\'t been before. With what I saved on the mattress I went ahead and bought a nice mattress pad/cover to put on top to make it a little more soft. I had always been told you can make a firm mattress more soft but you can\'t make a soft mattress more firm so if it\'s too firm invest in a good pad and it can make a lot of difference if you prefer a softer bed.What I noticed right away is when I woke up I wasn\'t as sore. I feel a lot more rested in the morning and I\'m not waking up to turn over or move around near as much as I was. Granted our old mattress was 10 years old and that had a lot to do with it, but still this mattress is obviously better and keeps me in a deep sleep for longer periods throughout the night.My husband also says he\'s sleeping better and isn\'t flopping around like he had been doing with the old mattress. He\'s the one of us always complaining about being hot while sleeping and he said he hasn\'t noticed this mattress makes that any worse, and if anything since he\'s not moving around so much it\'s better.We like it so much we plan to order the 8"" version for our kid\'s bunk bed here soon.As we get more use of out this I will try to update this review for how it\'s holding up. I don\'t expect to get 10 years out of it, granted i probably shouldn\'t have tried to get 10 years out of the older one but it held up for at least 8-9 of those years. For this price I\'d be happy if it lasts a couple of years. If it lasts longer even better. I highly suggest if this is too firm for you to buy a nice mattress pad and to buy it while it\'s at the price it is now.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 21, 2017', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great Packaging, Soft Yet Supportive, and Top Value for the Price', 'author': 'Ming W.', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I tend to be very critical when reviewing a product but this 12"" memory foam mattress deserved a good rating. The reasons are for 1. Packaging (definitely matters when it comes to something as big as a mattress that you have to handle on your own), 2. Level of comfort, and 3. Val0ue. I want to also include the fact that I have 4 bulging discs from a bad accident and bought this for the level of support and comfort one gets from a memory foam mattress.1. The Packaging: I\'m not the strongest or tallest person and had no one to help with getting this on my platform bedframe. Oh yes and I live on the second floor of an apartment building with no elevator and slightly uneven stairs. But I was a able to get it done without hurting or straining anything. The packaging was solid and convenient enough to allow for some sliding and scraping of the package prior to getting it into my apartment and still not damaging or dirtying the mattress. I had to pickup this approximately 5\'8"" package at the local UPS pickup center because my apartment building has a front gate that has to be manually opened and if they had left it in front of my door, it would block the walkway and would most likely have been taken anyways. I also had to rent a Home Depot pickup truck to pick this up, it would not have fit into my 2 door coupe. This would fit into a large SUV with the seats folded down but the box that it came in is approximately 5\'8"" x 18"" x 18"" (check the product details for exact measurements) and will definitely not fit into the trunk of your typical sedan. I was able to lift (maybe 40-50lbs?) this and get it into the pickup. Getting this up my stairway was the challenge and to do this I had to flip it from end to end on the stairs. The packaging was a hard cardboard box and withstood the tumbling. Once the box was removed, I found that the mattress was compressed, rolled-up, vacuum sealed in heavy plastic, and inserted into a solid plastic/polyester protective bag (kind of like the carrying bags of sleeping bags). This protective bag kept the mattress protected and was removed by tearing the perforation. It required a little bit of effort, but was doable without scissors. I then had to unroll it with the zipper fabric cover side down, carefully cut the plastic vacuum wrap and that was it. The mattress did have to be flipped so that the proprer side was on the bottom but it was easy enough. The mattress rose to its intended thickness within 24 hours, and most of it within 30min. All in all, the packaging was well done and I was able to set it up by myself without damaging the contents. The mattress itself had a fabric zippered cover that I kept on and I also put the entire mattress into a vinyl zippered cover.2. The Feel of the Mattress: Comfortable due to the softness yet supportive aspect of memory foam but I could slightly feel the foundation frame underneath. I opted for the 12"" mattress because obviously the thicker the mattress, the higher amount of memory foam material as well as the support foam underneath. I read a review for an 8"" mattress and the writer mentioned that she would have gone for at least a 10"". I put this on a metal platform foundation and I believe that if I had gone for anything less than 12"", I would not be giving it a 5 star for comfort. This mattress was definitely supportive and took pressure off of my back and joints. It had enough memory foam material that I sank in some but was supported by the base layer of support foam. For a little around $270 with taxes, I doubt that I would have found a comparable mattress with this level of comfort. Yes, it memory foam is known to trap a bit of heat and I did feel more heat than a spring mattress but I do sleep with the AC on so it wasn\'t an issue. If you are one that is very averse to heat or sweat easily as I do, you may want to consider a gel infused top. I didn\'t feel like I was in the clouds but it was comfortable enough with enough actual memory foam for the feel.3. Value: Definitely well priced. I had visited a Tempurpedic both at the OC County Fair and the price was nearly $2K. This mattress didn\'t feel as good as that model but for $270, I doubt that I would have found another mattress with memory foam. I had looked at a lot of options on Amazon and for a 12"" thick option with Certi-Pure certification, along with infused carbon material to keep it from smelling, this mattress was the best priced out there. Plus, you technically don\'t need a boxspring and a platform frame could be purchased for as low as $60-$70 increasing the value. So all in all, if you are considering a memory foam option, this one is the one to go with.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 5, 2016', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Comfortable, Supportive and Affordable', 'author': 'The Third Man', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'I know you are skeptical of the low price - as I was - but this mattress keeps appearing on best-of lists for good reason.

First off, I'm a flight attendant. I sleep in a lot of hotel beds. I know what a good and bad bad feels like. THIS BED IS AMAZING. Feeling impartial about the non conforming bed of the future? Think you'll miss the springs? No way. I promise. I felt the same. I sat there for 36 hours straight watching this bed rise in my kitchen festering the idea that I made a mistake. What is this? Why does it have to rise? Who even am I right now? The instructions were like one sentence and I probably messed it up. Omg what if I messed up?! 2017 is weird, I hate this. I hate New things. JK NOPE. I HAVE NO REGRETS! This bed cured my boyfriend's back pain. This bed cured my sleepless nights. MY PHAT @zz can sleep on my side without my spine feeling broken in half. I can sleep on my back or stomach no problem. I can't remember the last time I slept through the night... Now I can't wake up. We spent three days sleeping til 2pm. Today I missed my alarm for work by 2 hours. I legitimately slept through 2 hours of backup alarms that go off every 10 minutes. THIS BED IS THE DEVIL. But like a good devil that greets you with puppies and all things great in this world. This bed is the Oprah of beds. This bed is like getting a whole row to yourself on an airplane. This bed is like seeing your ex and they look like a potato and your eyeliner is so fleek it pierces their heart. This bed is freshly signed divorced papers. THIS BED IS ALL YOU NEED IN THIS LIFE. Its dirt cheap, soft yet firm, and will make you laugh pretty hard the first time you're trying to get rowdy on it. I've had this bed a few weeks now and I am pretty convinced that this is the best decision I've ever made in my life besides losing my virginity and buying a motorcycle. TOP THREE for sure. So stop debating and order this bed. Just do it. (Shia lebeouff voice) (I probably spelt that wrong)Oh and it doesn't smell bad. I read that it did. It smelled like it was compressed in a bag and shipped across the country which was expected, but it went away.

I had been sleeping on a 20 year old spring king size mattress.I have the 12” Green Tea version. King. I am a 36 year old side sleeper who weighs 140 lbs.My wife is a 27 year old side and back sleeper who weighs around 250 lbs.I have the pleasure of being able to tell you how this mattress compares with a Zinus 8” cooling gel mattress and a 10” Green Tea mattress.In the 8 years I have owned this 12” mattress not a lot has changed. It has broken in but not down. It is noticeably less firm than the other mattresses without being considered not firm.There are no lumps, dips, divets or sunken in spots. I would buy it again in a heartbeat. In fact I know 6 other people who have purchased this mattress solely because they house sat my dogs for me while on vacation and slept in my bed.So let’s break it down:I purchased the mattress and it came tightly rolled and compressed in a bag that was in a box. I dragged the box to my spare bedroom and dumped it out. I rolled the plastic with the bed in it out and carefully pulled the plastic away from the mattress before carefully cutting along the seam in a quick motion with a box cutter. It immediately began to inflate. I pulled the plastic complete off and left it on the guest room floor. At the time I had just purchased the house. The carpet was clean and the only other item in the room were 3 moving boxes. I opened the 2 windows in the room. It was spring in SC so about 80 degrees. I left the room and continued to clean and unpack. I checked on the mattress about 6 hours later and it looked fully inflated. The room had a smell. It was very light and smelled like new foam as to be expected. I went along and plucked at the corners which were all still not fully up. Left the room and cleaned. I checked in it again before going to bed that night. The bed looked fully inflated, including the corners. I did not touch it. I went to bed and left it alone until that next night giving it almost a full 48 hours. I dragged my old mattress out of my room that night and leaned it against a wall in the spare room and then with the help of my then girlfriend, took the new mattress and placed it on my bed frame. (Which is an adjustable bed frame. More on that later.) there was no longer a smell. I grabbed my old sheets which fit on it perfectly even though this mattress is 12” and my old one was 6”. Grabbed my comforter and pillows and me, my girlfriend and 35 lb Australian cattle dog Beaux and 6 lb chihuahua Wiggles lay down. Heaven.I was 28 and weighed 115 lbs at that time. I had hurt my back at work tripping over a cord while carrying a heavy load when I was 23. My back had never been the same. For the first time in 5 years I lay on that mattress and no longer felt the pressure in my back. Or the constant searing pain. I do not sink into it. It’s by no means cloud like or marshmallow plush. On a scale of 1-10 with 1 being most firm and wooden plank like and 10 being marshmallow soft where you sink and get trapped this is a 3-4. It relieves pressure points but isn’t hard. I don’t bend when I lay on it but can feel my hip and shoulder go in. I don’t get very hot on it and I’m a very hot, very light restless sleeper. Any movement, light, sound, breathing will wake me up. Basically I’m just really bad at sleeping. It’s very good at not transferring movement so my girlfriend could roll or move and I wouldn’t wake up. When I bought the mattress I also got a waterproof cover because Wiggles was 14 and had seizures. Sometimes he would wet himself during the seizures so the protector could protect the mattress. It doesn’t crinkle and you can’t feel it, but even 8 years later the mattress looks like the day I drug it onto the bed.It bends on an adjustable base but is thick enough that it doesn’t bend all the way. The base also vibrates to massage your back. I can feel it through the mattress as well though it is very dampened.Sexy time is no different on this than with a spring mattress. You don’t sink in, there is less bounce and no squeaky springs.Fast forward to 2020. The pandemic. I am now 34 and weigh 155 lbs. mattress still feels and looks the same even with weight gain. No bumps or lumps and not hot, unless it’s summer but no matter what mattress you have you’re gonna be hot when it’s 106 degrees outside and the ac on your 102 barely insulated house is struggling.My spare room is no longer empty with just 3 boxes. It’s now a whole guest room. And it also has a Zinus bed frame and 10” green tea mattress. 10” compared to 12” is a little bit on the firmer side. Now a 2-3 on that scale from earlier. Still pressure relieving but motion transfers a little more. Beaux was testing it out with me and rolled and I could feel the bed jump. Guests still absolutely love it and talk about buying one. I always take them to my room so they can lay on mine and tell me if they feel a difference. They always end up choosing the 12” and buy it for their home.I have slept on the cooling foam Zinus mattress at 8” at my mother in laws house. It is not noticeably cooler but IS noticeably firmer. A 1.5 on that scale from earlier. Just shy of being a wooden plank. I was stiff the next day and my shoulders and torn back muscle aches. My advice is to go thicker on the mattress no matter your weight. Gives more pressure relief without giving you the sink. My mattress at 12” is by no means not firm but it’s also pressure relieving and not rock like.It’s now October 29th 2022.I’m 36 and weigh 140. Wiggles is no longer with us but the mattress cover and Beaux remain. Stryker the 50 lb Australian cattle dog has joined us. I write this review at 8:09 am, laying on the mattress. I slept for 7.5 hours and have no pains, stiffness or aches. I feel well rested. My wife is slightly snoring and just rolled a little and I barely felt it and only because I was awake to notice. I highly recommend this mattress and will replace it with another one exactly like it at the 10 year mark if it feels like it needs to be replaced. It doesn’t feel any different than the day I bought it now though. Maybe the 12-15 year mark if that’s the case.Sweet dreams and have a good night, y’all.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 29, 2022', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '1.0 out of 5 stars SECOND PURCHASE IN -- FULL REVIEWS OF BOTH!', 'author': 'Buckeye Baby', 'rating': 1, 'content': 'SECOND PURCHASE REVIEW - 12-02-2021 - Big fat BUMMER! I am incredibly disappointed in my second purchase - exact same mattress - exact same thickness yet a completely different mattress and experience!? You can read below - I absolutely loved this mattress - originally purchased in 2018 - recommended it to everyone but, this one is so bad -- it is so soft I nearly sink to the bottom - at first this bed was firm yet within a month or less it was horrible -- all support gone -- like sleeping in a bowl of mashed potatoes -- LOL -- you got the visual right? It\'s now four months later after my second purchase and I am on Amazon tonight buying a new mattress -- so disappointed! What changed Zinus? I was a loyal customer -- and not for nothing -- the people who most recently bought their own Zinus bed due to my recommendation are having the same problems too. I long for the days when products were made well, good quality products with consistency in expectations. No matter what you purchase these days it truly is a ""luck of the draw"" -- unfortunately, that\'s it for me...no more Zinus products-- yes, I bought other Zinus products too -- but, no more -- again, so sad as I was their biggest fan! Cannot recommend any longer. BUMMER!-------------------------------------------------------------FIRST BED REVIEWS BELOW-------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE: 09-06-2021 - Bed is STILL a great one!! I wish those bad reviewers would have done their research -- to learn more about the mold, smell etc. read below! :) NO MOLD OR SMELL HERE - EVER!UPDATE 06-22-2020- Bed is STILL fantastic! Use it every single nigh and would still highly recommend. I actually told a friend and she bought a queen and loves it too and she has had her\'s for a year as well- husband and herself sleep on it nightly also! Again, highly recommend it\'s the BEST! :)ORIGINAL REVIEW: 2018- I researched beds like many other buyers for weeks. I read review after review, watched video after video and took a plethora of ""mattress quizzes"" online attempting to find the perfect mattress. I also visited stores and laid on different beds that had rave reviews; I did my homework, to say the least. It bears mentioning here; not all beds are perfect for every person that\'s simply not realistic. Each person\'s sleep needs and preferences are quite different and very personal. We have to find the mattress that\'s right for each of us and all things considered this process is what makes shopping for a mattress a dreaded experience for most, including me! :)I was very skeptical about this particular mattress. Price was the first concern, it\'s so cheap how could it be any good I thought. I was also concerned it would be another one of those memory foam mattresses that made every bone in my body ache when I got up each day. I doubted it would have the pressure relief support I needed as well. I was also very worried the mattress would have the bad odor and/or mold issues that other reviewers here on Amazon had experienced. However, I took a chance anyway. Why? Because it was so cheap and the pressure relief it ""promised"" I desperately wanted.I purchased the 10-inch twin mattress, box less heavy duty supporter frame, as well as the white bed skirt all from Zinus and all, provided through Amazon. I am a middle-aged woman, and while it may seem strange to drop down to a twin size bed as an adult, I simply wanted too. I was only using a twin size portion of my current king size bed anyway and it seemed to make sense. I say this so readers are aware I am not a kid using a twin size bed but, an adult.The bed arrived and I immediately opened the box - NO odor at all! So thankful! I removed the plastic from the bed, immediately put the plastic back in the box in case the plastic had off-gassing on it ( as I read to do ) and again smelled NO odor. I rolled out the bed and literally within a few minutes the bed expanded to 99% of its full size. I took the bed to the bedroom laid in on its side against a wall by a well-ventilated window and allowed it to expand and air out as instructed on other video\'s I watched for off-gassing. The bed never smelled, not once and expanded to its full capacity within an hour. I was elated!That night, I slept on the mattress on the floor as the box less frame was not arriving until the next day. I was amazed at how comfortable and supportive this little bed was and I slept very well! The next day the box less frame arrived and I put the entire set up together. I had high hopes that my next night\'s sleep would be even better and I have to say this mattress did not disappoint! I awoke with no aches, no pains and can only remember turning in my sleep once throughout the entire night. I literally woke the next morning and said aloud, ""WOW! I can\'t remember sleeping like this since I was in my 30\'s!""Now, in earnest, the only alteration I made to the bed was the addition of a 2-inch egg-crate pad on the top. I simply prefer the feel of the egg-crate pads but, I think the mattress would be just as amazing without it. Also, this is a medium firmness mattress- so if you are looking for ""firm"" this is not it. Also, if you are looking for super soft this bed is not it. It\'s definitely a medium firmness which is perfect for me, personally.In fairness, I don\'t doubt the reviews that discussed off-gassing and odors. What I did read is that if nearly ANY bed-in-a-box is stored in a warehouse or otherwise for long periods of time there is a high chance the off-gassing becomes worse and it can and will produce mold in some cases. That being said, it\'s likely many of the mattresses people received in other negative reviews were stored for extended periods of time. So, it does appear to be a ""buyer beware"" situation regardless of which bed you buy; which stinks for sure- sometimes- literally! This is only my ""opinion"" after reading so much about these off-gassing bed situations. I wished this process was more regulated and I really wish these products were ALL made in the U.S.A. To this day when I open any product that says ""made in China"" or the like- I always wonder why on earth they can\'t make it here? It doesn\'t seem to me that producing this type of bed would not be all that costly to do it in the U.S.A. surely there\'s got to be a way to do this? But, that\'s a whole different subject.In my case the mattress was awesome, there was no odor, I have slept amazing and I am incredibly grateful I took a chance and bought this Zinus mattress as well as the frame and bed skirt, all have been a terrific purchase!I am leaving this five-star review simply because for me, it is true and I personally would highly recommend it!

Six months wasn\'t enough time to give this bed a proper review. The big question you probably have is would you buy it again? Yes.This has been our nighty sleeper since purchased. We rotated the bed every three months. The wife has been very very happy with the bed as a back sleeper. She praises the deep, relaxing sleep almost every day. Around the 6 month mark, as a side sleeper, I started to have deep pressure points on my hips. I would move around a little and be fine, but I could feel the residual pain later in the day. That\'s where I\'m at. Meh.I\'ve finally gotten to the point where I\'m looking at another mattress in the next year. Wifey doesn\'t know this yet because she\'s super happy with the bed. I am too, but I want a better sleep. I miss the deep sleep I had the first few months.These beds are perfect for growing kids or a guest bedroom. That\'s why I say I would purchase another, because I will for that application.****I wanted to make sure I put some thought into this review as I was once just like you. I was on the fence about buying a bedfrom Amazon. If your reading this, good job trying to educate yourself on this purchase! There are THOUSANDS of positivereviews on this bed and as of 5/19/17 mine is one of them. I set a Google calander reminder to update this review 6 monthsfrom today.The wife and I purchased the Zinus 14"" metal platform (no headboard) instead of using our old boxspring. We wanted to havethe extra bed available in case we had over night guests. The bed frame was easy enough to put together, I\'m pretty sure itsonly 20 wing nuts and bolts. I took the additional step of brushing thread sealant on the bolts to reduce the possiblity of*squeeks* and vibration as other reviewers have suggested.Unboxing the mattress was pretty straight forward. I watched a few Youtube videos and I suggest you do the same. Carefullycut the tape on the cardboard box and dump out the big heavy white bag. The mattress itself is inside the white plastic bagthat you rip open once you have the bag on the frame. Repeat. Open once you have the bag on the frame. DO NOT CUT THE WHITEBAG, RIP IT ALONG THE SEAM! Align the mattress on the frame and remove the clear plastic bag. Once the bed is completelyremoved from the packaging, measure the mattress thickness, do another alignment, pull the corners up toward you if they arefolded under and start the clock.I purchased the bed set in early April and the temperature wasn\'t exactly warm. As other reviewers have done, I brought in asmall space heater to warm up the room. This seemed to help expand the foam faster and uniformly. After 2 hours the mattresswas about 8 inches and I went to work leaving this project until later in the evening. Upon returning home, I found the bedhad expanded to 11 1/2 inches! I was very tempted to sleep on the bed that night but my wife reminded me that I shouldn\'truin our new bed....a total of 36 hours have gone by...The wife has agreed that the bed is now ready to sleep on! I measured the thickness of the bed in 4 different locations allof which were over 12 inches. I\'d say our bed has expanded to 12 1/4 inches! There didn\'t seem to be any visible dips orlumps in the mattress.I\'m 6\'4"" 235lbs side sleeper, wifey is 5\'9"" 130lbs back sleeper and both found the bed to be very comfortable. I did not findthe bed to be ""marshmallow"" soft, but more on the medium soft/firm level. Is this a complaint? Nope. If you\'ve never slept ona memory foam mattress there is a bit of getting used to. It\'s not bad, the bed just doesn\'t react like a tradtionalboxspring would. I was shocked at how well my wife and I both slept that night. Yes, there are a few days to acclimateyourself to this bed so don\'t jump into it expecting the magic floating marshmallow unicorn will usher you off to the deepestsleep you ever had on the first rainbow star lit night of spring. Did I sleep incredibly well the first few nights? Youfriggen bet Mr. Lahey!Regarding heat... I read where others had to change how they layered the bed sheets/comforter and will agree with that. Whilethis bed is not HOT it is warm so you may have to rethink having 6 layers of bed sheets. I sleep hot, but once I rethought mybedding heat was no longer an issue.For people wondering how this bed handles adult fun play time I wouldn\'t worry. The wife and I made sure to diligently testthis aspect of mattress performance and are happy to report... neither of us really noticed a difference. Our only realcomplaint was more with the bed frame than the mattress. There are no grooves/slots/tabs to secure the mattress to the frameor vice versa. Hence, the bed can move if your really really into adult fun play time.I can say after a solid month of sleeping on this bed that it\'s amazing. I wake up rested, no hip pain, and groggy from themass amount of REM sleep I just experienced. Only time will tell how this mattress holds up. Right now, it fit the bill andour budget.

I opened and laid it out on top of a guest room bed to inflate. In 4 hours it appeared to be fully inflated. However packing info says wait 24-48 hours before using to allow proper time to inflate. I did however break down and climb on to see how it feels. I am on a pillow top mattress currently that is roughly 6-8 years old and has been causing me a lot of pain in my shoulder and hip as I am a side sleeper. Just laying on this bed for a few minutes its much firmer than my current bed, and so very comfortable. I will leave a more through review once I have actually slept in it for a few nights. I can say I am very excited. I plan to put it on my current box springs, and we will see how it goes. I was a bit disappointed to realize you cant flip the mattress only rotate it, which is what I have currently with my terrible pillow top . and I like to flip my mattresses every month. I will also state that when I unrolled it I was really worried about it forming its natural state as it had a lot of weird lumps from packing, but it has formed to a normal mattress already on a cursory view of it on my way out the door today. I will better inspect it when moving it to my actual bed. Update!! I have been sleeping on this mattress for about a week now. I will say one night I did get very warm, however I don't think it was my mattress I tend to run hot and cold and occasionally has the same issue with my old pillow top. This mattress is shockingly firm when you first sit or lay on it you think oh Hell No! But within second the memory foam begins to contour to your body and it's very comfortable. I am a side sleeper and was having alot of hip pain with my old mattress. While my pain isn't gone it's much better, and I think it will go away given more time with this new bed. My review is definitely a positive one. For 179$ and arriving in 2 days I'm very pleased. Included are 3 photos the last photo shows me sitting on the edge of the bed showing how much it goes down with my weight, and that I don't know why people say you can't sit on the sides I can't sit on any side any corner no issues... and even with my weight it springs right back to shape once I move or get up, it also still provides comfort and support this bed is rated up to 500lbs! Which thankfully I am not!********* Updated Review***********I have been sleeping on this bed for over a month now, and wanted to update my thoughts. My hip and shoulder were in ALOT of pain when I bought my new mattress. I couldn't barely walk around during the day from the pain, now I am fully recovered and I credit my bed for this. If you are on a budget and cant spend 500-1000$ on a new mattress I greatly recommend this item.If you are plus sized and worried about it don't be this bed is tested for 500lbs and as a big girl myself I sleep amazing on it with my HUGE dog and cat.

Knowing my products, the sleep certifications and how to match a customer to the right sleep system to improve their quality of life was something I took very seriously and truly enjoyed. That said - One of the difficult things to do was sell against this ‘new breed of online mattress companies’ like Casper etc offering quality queen sets to compete with brands like Tempurpedic for around $1000. The issue wasn’t the quality per say, but rather if a sleeper TRULY understood what they specifically needed (considering proper alignment, WITH PRESSURE RELIEF) vs simply assuming ‘firm is best… it is NOT’, that person COULD buy online and save money. That said I did have a healthy amount of people who got burned by making ill informed choices online who came in and bought from me. My mrs and I WERE on a Sleep to Live 400 (middle of their quality line) queen set where we had scientifically designed sides tailored to our body. Think a customized Simmons Beautyrest pocketed coil style mattress with cooling material in the surface bc we sleep hot. In 2009 when we bought it, it retailed for $2200. It was fantastic. It has a 20 yr warranty (if no stains or damage), where if it sags more than 1 1/2”, we get a replacement. While still comfortable today, *WE’VE changed*. Different needs with pressure relief, different support needs.. dare I say we weigh more 😳👀😂… I am a student of the Tempurpedic and various other memory foam products. TP launched an ENTIRELY NEW category in bedding with quality memory foam. Although that came at a hefty price. We own one original TP cloud twin my 16yo sleeps well on, i was allowed 1 ‘friends and family priced’ TP product per year at about 40-50% of retail. The caviat to that was I was not allowed a comfort exchange on it, the one I thought we wanted was $2500 at f&f, and to ME, that was too expensive a gamble, ESPECIALLY when we liked our STL 400. So I could never pull the trigger. We decided to go king size for Christmas. Along with size, comes bed frame, mattress protectors, sheets, comforters, etc… going up in size I bought this mattress based on a few REALLY key points:- it was Certi-pur certified- no fiberglass- reviews said no smell upon opening- 150k+ reviews at 4.5 stars??- in memory foam (specifically lower price) thicker typically = good pressure relief- price was absurd at $400 on black Friday My final thoughts - if this WORKS, transitioning to memory foam, we’ll be set up otherwise to buy a better mattress as needed. It has worked since day.. 1 It’s very normal to take 1-4 weeks to ‘get acclamated to’ a new mattress. We made it clear in the business to give it time.. at LEAST 7 days, up to 30. If your body doesn’t like it at that point, come in to exchange it. This thing came out of the box with *ZERO*…. Smell. We brought it in from the cold and opened it at 3:30, and despite knowing it takes up to 72 hours to fully expand from shrink shipping, slept on it that night.- back pain - none- shoulder pain - MUCH better (id been having issues sleeping due to shoulder pain)- mattress rebound - perfectly acceptable (doesn’t feel like your stuck in a hole)- tossing and turning - drastically reduced All in all, we are SUPREMELY happy with this mattress. Longevity - Im truly not as concerned bc its already served its purpose and gotten us through the transition from coil to foam, and queen to king. If it only lasted a year, id chalk it up to being cheap, and with next to no concern upgrade to a brand with more history in higher quality.

I bought my first in September of 2018 to replace an old mattress for my daughter... it was great, and my daughter loved the mattress... no issues at all with the mattress... my son needed a new mattress too, so I was about to order a 2nd one in February 2019 when I noticed numerous reviews (many recent) citing reports of bedbugs.Now let me clarify my experience here... I work in the hospitality business and maintain dormitories for military training students that are on a constant rotation, much like a hotel. We are all trained to spot, look for and deal with bed bugs should ever the problem arise... bed bugs have nothing to do with personal hygene or cleanliness, they can infest anything from the sleaziest no-tell motel to the fanciest 5-star Hyatt Regency. Also, bed bugs don't limit themselves to beds, they will travel and hide on/in anything... clothes, shoes, carpets, suitcases, curtains, laptops, alarm clocks, a book... bed bugs aren't picky. For those reviewers that say they got bedbugs... if you think it came from the mattress and you just tossed it out, problem solved... YOU STILL HAVE BEDBUGS because your house is now infested (or previously was and you just now noticed).Now back to these Linenspa mattresses... I LOVE THESE THINGS... they're very comfortable and affordable... both my kids love them. I had already purchased one back in 2018 and never had any issues, and as someone who can spot those little devils, our house is free of them. When I ordered my 2nd mattress (after reading the negative bug reviews) I went ahead and took the added precaution... and you should too... if you're ever worried about something like this...INSPECT AND OPEN THE MATTRESS OUTSIDE YOUR HOUSE!I just laid a bedsheet in the driveway, opened the box, inspected the vacuum-sealed wrap... saw nothing... opened it up on the sheet on my driveway (to keep it clean of course) and fully inspected this sucker everywhere... nope... no bugs, no smells... just a nice clean beautiful mattress.

I've bought two of these mattresses from this company and never had an issue with bugs or smells... and if I need a third or fourth mattress, i would buy another... but if you ever suspect or worry about something like this from this company, or ANY company... just open it outside on a clean sheet and inspect thoroughly before you bring it in.... that way if there is a problem, you don't risk letting them into your home."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States March 1, 2019', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great value for the price and has lasted a long time and still comfortable', 'author': 'Charlotte Martina', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""We purchased this mattress for my daughter when we upgraded her bed frame.

What they did was very simple yet efficient. At night when no one was around, they quietly replaced the sign \'Mattress Factory\' in front of the building with one that reads \'Rug Factory"". At first, the bed bugs were perplexed, they like to be snug but they are bed bugs, not rug bugs, so after much discussion, they decided to move on and infest the factory down the street. That said if you want your mattress with bed bugs you have to order them separately, they do not come with the mattress anymore.Now if you really believed that a brand new mattress could come with bed bugs, I guess you also believed my story, so be at peace no bed bugs.On the serious side of things, the mattress is to my taste medium-soft more than medium-firm. Of course, that will vary a lot depending on whom you ask. I am male, 5\'9 and 175lbs and I guess your weight also has a lot to do with if it feels firm or soft. The mattress is very flexible (it comes in a box) so what you have under the mattress may also affect how it feels.I only had this mattress for a little over a week now and so far I am very pleased. It looks nice, yet it doesn\'t look like a $1,000 mattress which is normal and I really don\'t see the point in buying a very fancy mattress that no one will ever see except you when you change the sheets. That said I haven\'t encountered any major defects on the seems or anything of the sort. I found one tiny imperfection in one seem, yet it doesn\'t look like it may rip apart, just not super nice. So far no noise from the springs nor any other problems.I did a lot of research before buying this mattress, I was one click away from buying another one for around $600. Reading all the reviews I realized that people complain of mattresses losing the form or having other kinds of defects after a relatively short time despite being much more expensive $600-$1,000).I also realize that no matter what; there are only two basic kinds of mattresses. The memory foam ones, which I don\'t trust because like people they lose the memory with age. Let say that some of them may even suffer from Alzheimer\'s. The other ones are the Hybrids which are basically spring structures covered with a layer of memory foam. In this case, even if the memory foam goes South, you still have the springs, so it seems like they must last longer.Of course, they all claim to have a proprietary and unique technology that will allow you to sleep like a baby. Nevertheless, they will still be in one of the two mentioned categories, the rest could be true, or just sales speech.Long story short, if this one goes bad after a year or two, I wasted $120. If I buy one of those $1,000 ones and they go bad after a year or two I will be extremely disappointed, angry, and sleeping on an uncomfortable mattress. I don\'t know you but it doesn\'t sound to me like a good sleeping formula.Of course, I could go with one of those $7,000 ones they tried to sell me at the Home & Garden show (yes I am still laughing at the salesman). I guess they are really comfortable, but then the credit card payment will take away my sleep so no thank you.The pain relief low rate is because it didn\'t help with my lower back pain, but I don\'t think it is the mattress\'s fault, apparently, I need a firm mattress for that and that may not be the solution for everyone\'s pain.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 16, 2021', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Changed my review', 'author': 'Patricia Evans', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Updated review:Although I wasn\'t going to order the same mattress, I couldn\'t decided what I wanted, and I didn\'t want to pay a lot of money for a mattress that wouldn\'t be used often.

If you expect the mattress at this low cost to be acceptable then it should suffice. Just please make sure you know what you’re getting when you purchase.We had come from an 8"" Zinus Memory foam green tea mattress which lasted us a good 10 years and my wife wanted a little more support and we decided on another 8"" mattress but using springs instead.We received the mattress and I immediately looked at it and it looked small and dinky. We were using the same bed frame and the mattress itself was smaller in every dimension, length, width and height. The bed sheets we had used wouldn\'t even fit! Also every time we tried to lay down, the springs would make a popping noise and you would sink deep into the mattress as if the springs were too ""weak"". Perhaps it\'s because they are bonnel springs which is decades old in terms of design or that the springs they use are flimsy? I think they are 6.5"" springs, maybe they should redesign and use better gauge wires? The fabric of the mattress is pretty low quality as well.We slept on the mattress for two nights and both my wife and I had terrible sleep. We both didn\'t want to move because the bed is so loud!I ended up calling Amazon and got a refund and went with a Zinus 10"" pocket coil hybrid and while it ended up being $100 more it is 100% better. The dimensions were correct, the springs would actually hold you up so you\'re not sinking in, and it\'s simply made of better quality parts.I convinced myself to try the linenspa brand but I personally wouldn\'t purchase from them again even if I were to purchase a pocket coil version of the mattress.

Johnson', 'rating': 3, 'content': 'If you’ve been reading reviews of this mattress, no doubt you’ve seen all the reviews claiming that someone found bedbugs in their mattress, and no doubt you’re starting to wonder whether buying this mattress is worth the risk. However, unlike many of the previous reviewers, I actually have firsthand experience with bedbugs. Thanks to the people who once lived in the apartment below mine, I know far more about bedbugs than I ever wanted to know. So, to set your mind at ease, here are a few important facts about bedbugs and why you’re highly unlikely to find them in a brand-new factory-sealed mattress.1. Contrary to popular belief, bedbugs are not tiny little unidentifiable specks. An adult bedbug is reddish brown, about the size and shape of an apple seed, and easily identifiable as a bug. Bedbug eggs and nymphs (babies) are tiny little specks, but they’re whitish or yellowish. So if you see tiny dark spots on your new mattress, they are NOT bedbugs or bedbug eggs. Even if they appear to be moving, it’s probably due to static electricity or air currents, not because they’re alive. Any tiny specks on a new mattress are probably exactly what the manufacturer says they are, which is flecks of burned plastic left over from the packaging process.2. Bedbugs won’t crawl into a mattress just because it’s a mattress. Bedbugs don’t know what mattresses are. Bedbugs are small, slow-moving critters that can’t jump or fly, so their preferred prey is something that’s lying still and oblivious to its surroundings, i.e., sleeping humans. They\'re attracted to sleeping humans by the carbon dioxide that humans exhale, and then they hide in or near the bed because they’ve found a food source in the bed, not because they’re somehow intelligent enough to recognize a mattress and seek out mattresses that aren’t currently occupied by humans.3. Bedbugs would have trouble getting established in a factory. Certainly they could hitchhike into a factory on a worker’s clothes or belongings, but once there, they wouldn’t thrive. They prefer to hide during the day and feed at night. They don’t like bright lights or prey that’s awake, moving around, and alert enough to smack any bugs they feel crawling on them. Any bedbug that made its way into a mattress factory would probably just get stepped on, not start a colony in the equipment and infest all the mattresses. (See above: no way is a bedbug intelligent enough to think to itself, ""Hey, that thing over there is a mattress. If I hide in it, I\'ll eventually get delivered somewhere that I can find a sleeping person to bite."")4. Bedbugs aren’t indestructible. It’s true that they’re highly resistant to pesticides, and according to some sources, they can live a year without food and 18 months without oxygen. But one thing that does reliably kill bedbugs is heat, and furthermore, bedbugs can be squashed. In the unlikely event that a bedbug crawled onto a mattress in a factory, it probably wouldn’t survive as the mattress is compressed with giant rollers, wrapped in multiple layers of shrink wrap (which requires heat to shrink the shrink wrap), stored in a non-climate-controlled warehouse, shipped in the non-climate-controlled hold of a cargo ship, etc.5. Bedbug nymphs require a blood meal to progress from one stage of development to the next. Even if a bedbug got onto a mattress in the factory (unlikely, because they don’t know what a mattress is), survived the packaging process (unlikely), and laid eggs inside the packaging (only possible if this specific bedbug is a pregnant female), you wouldn’t end up with a mattress crawling with bedbugs. Without anything to eat, the nymphs would not develop. (And no, these hypothetical bedbugs inside the packaging couldn\'t survive by eating each other. The only thing bedbugs eat is mammalian blood.)6. A bug on your bed isn\'t automatically a bedbug. Bedbugs are a specific species of insect. Walking across a bed doesn\'t make any other kind of bug a bedbug, any more than walking across a cow pasture would make you a cow. (I bring this point up because I\'ve looked at a number of photos of supposed bedbugs posted by other reviewers. Only one photo clearly showed a bug, and that bug was the wrong shape to be a bedbug.) It\'s possible for a bug to get into a warehouse or delivery truck and hide in a crevice of your package. It\'s also possible for a bug to get in through your open door while you\'re bringing your package inside, or for a bug that was already in your house to come out while you\'re unpackaging your mattress, and end up on your new mattress just because it\'s there. But none of these scenarios necessarily means that you have bedbugs. Granted, you probably don\'t want any bug of any species in your bed. However, bedbugs are particularly bad news because they will bite you and they\'re very hard to get rid of. But odds are that any other bug on your bed is something harmless that you can just vacuum up and forget about.7. If you buy a new factory-sealed mattress and later notice bedbugs in your home, that doesn’t prove that the bedbugs came from the mattress. Bedbugs can get into a home in any number of ways. Live in an apartment building? The bedbugs may have crawled through the walls from a neighboring apartment. Slept in a hotel or at someone else\'s house lately? You may have brought bedbugs home from there. Had overnight guests? They may have brought the bedbugs with them. Bought any used furniture, even if it wasn\'t bedroom furniture? It may have had bedbugs hiding in the cracks. Used public transportation? You may have picked up a bedbug that was hiding in the seat upholstery. And so on. Furthermore, a bedbug infestation in a home can start with just one pregnant female bedbug, but bedbugs reproduce slowly by insect standards, so it could take weeks or months for the infestation to get big enough to notice. So by the time you realize you have bedbugs, they\'ve probably been there for quite a while and it\'s likely impossible to trace where they came from. But a brand-new sealed mattress is about the least likely source. (And by the way, bedbugs don\'t come from bad hygiene or unsanitary living conditions. Bedbugs aren\'t attracted by dirt or garbage or smells; they\'re attracted by people who breathe, which is, last time I checked, everybody. So the cleanest person in the most spotlessly neat home can get bedbugs just as fast as the smelliest slob who never washes his sheets, because both the clean person and the smelly slob breathe.)8. If, in spite of everything I just said, you’re still feeling paranoid about bedbugs, there’s a simple precaution you can take. Buy a zippered mattress cover that’s labeled “dust mite proof,” and as soon as you’ve unpackaged the mattress, zip it up in the cover and just keep it in the cover. (Bedbugs are bigger than dust mites, so anything that\'s impervious to dust mites is also impervious to bedbugs. And no, bedbugs can’t chew through a mattress cover. Their mouth parts are designed only for sucking blood, not chewing.) Also, if you have enough floor space, you can quarantine your new mattress for a few days. Lay it out on the floor where it’s not touching any walls or furniture and stick strips of double-sided tape to the floor all the way around it. In the almost impossible event that a bedbug comes crawling out of the mattress, it will get stuck in the tape and eventually die.In short, if you buy this mattress, you\'re not going to get any unwanted guests with it. (Well, let me rephrase that statement: you won\'t get any unwanted guests in the form of bedbugs. I can\'t make any guarantees about annoying relatives who invite themselves over.) So let\'s move on to a review of the mattress itself. Short version: It\'s okay, but I\'m not hugely impressed. Longer version:COMFORT/SUPPORT: I don\'t find this mattress supportive enough. Especially if I sleep on my stomach, I can feel my hips sagging into the mattress, which leads to a backache. Admittedly, I\'m a full-size adult who weighs, well, let\'s just say more than 150 pounds, so I may just be too heavy for an eight-inch twin mattress. (Still, the equally thin, cheapo inner-spring mattress I had before this one worked fine for years, so I suspect the problem is this mattress, not me.) If you\'re a heavier adult and/or prone to backaches, this may not be the mattress for you, especially not the eight-inch version. Also, the sides of the mattress are not reinforced, so if you sit on the edge of the bed, you\'ll sink down all the way to the box springs. You essentially have to hoist yourself out of a hole to get out of bed, so if you have difficulty standing up from a sitting position, this is not the ideal mattress for you.APPEARANCE: My mattress never fully expanded after it was unpackaged. The center reached a full eight inches, but the corners did not. The smashed-down corners don\'t really affect the usability of the mattress, but they do make it look oddly saggy and lumpy.SMELL: I didn\'t notice any bothersome smell. I could detect a faint scent when the mattress was brand new and I laid face-down on it without a sheet, but once I put sheets on, I no longer noticed it.NOISE: The springs squawk loudly when I\'m getting into or out of bed. However, they\'re loudest when my weight is concentrated in one spot. When I\'m lying down with my weight more widely distributed, the springs make very little noise when I roll over.DURABILITY: I\'ve only had this mattress a few months, so I don\'t know about long-term durability. However, the fabric top of the mattress is already starting to pill. As already noted, the sides of the mattress aren\'t reinforced. Also, the top is a cotton-like fabric that\'s not waterproof or water-resistant, which means that it will stain. If your child spills a juice box on the bed (to say nothing of more gross scenarios), you may be able to wipe away some of the stain with a wet washcloth, but the ghost of the stain will be there approximately forever. I don\'t think this mattress will hold up to long-term use.So, should you buy this mattress? If you need a cheap mattress delivered to your door in a small box in a hurry, then this is probably an acceptable option. And no, you\'re not going to get any bedbugs as a free bonus. But don\'t expect top-quality comfort or durability, because you\'re likely not going to get them either.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 14, 2020', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Bought it for my elderly mother', 'author': 'jennifer', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'She needed something with a decent firmness and extra support on the sides so she wouldn’t slip off like she would with her last full memory foam mattress.

My only worry is that the bottom of the mattress may not have the greatest protection for the inside materials but maybe I’m just worried about nothing. I will probably get a bunkie board because I have this mattress directly on a metal bed frame. I purchased a metal frame that is for mattresses only and doesn’t need a box spring or anything else.

I was torn between a full and a queen but I went with a full because my room is small. I’d say to just go for the queen. This is a decent size though. The metal frame that I bought for this bed was from Amazon also. I’m 5’9 1/2” and the mattress could stand to be longer height wise for me. I’m happy with my purchase though.

Good news is, that makes it much easier to get out of bed, just be careful if you sleep closer to the edges like I do. This is great if you\'re normally a middle of the mattress sleeper though. Otherwise decent mattress. Feels like it\'s more for back and belly sleepers than side sleepers, which is fine cause I\'m a rotisserie style sleeper (I roll around a lot). I would probably use this as a guest bed if you can afford it, but overall not the worst mattress you can find if you\'re getting one for yourself permanently. Definitely more to the firm side, but if you weigh a little more it might seem softer. Great for all the shortstacks and small kings. And kids, by that extension I suppose.

Now let me touch on this cooling effect and pain relieving factors. WOW! I mean WOW! I have been sleeping beautifully for days now, sleeping without waking up in the middle of the night due to back pain from laying down that long and I normally wake up for the day in a world of pain and have to take my pain meds before I can even sit up and stand up (successfully). I have not woken up with an ounce of pain, I wake up refreshed and ready for the day. This morning I didn’t even have to start the schedule of my 4 times a day medication upon opening my eyes during normal life with my normal what I thought was a great bed, a Serta.

It’s held up, is supportive and comfortable and never sleeps hot. It’s been a very good buy for me. It’s a very good inexpensive mattress that has proven to be a great value.I replaced a 20+ year old Sleep Number mattress with this mattress. I\'ve had it over a week now and love it. The mattress is medium firm, which I like. The top layer of gel-infused foam provides a bit of sink in comfort, but not to the extent that it\'s hard to move or change positions. Mine expanded to a full 12"" within 2-3 hours of putting it on my bed (I kept the Sleep Number foundation on the bed under this mattress). I don\'t wake up with back or shoulder pain at all. My old Sleep Number mattress was giving me both. To give you an idea of the give in the top layer, I have attached a couple of pics of my dogs on the mattress. I will say, they LOVE the new mattress and I have a hard time getting my Pittie (Black & White pup) to get off of it. The Rottie/Shepherd weighs about 92 pounds and you can see, the mattress has a good amount of cushioning for joints and pressure points. It\'s been a GREAT buy!I will check back in 3 months and a year so I can say how the mattress holds up over time. Can\'t beat the price on this and I will be buying another one for my son soon.A month and a half later - STILL loving this mattress. It is still very comfortable. I sleep great. I don\'t think it sleeps hot. I don\'t wake up with back or shoulder pain. I bought a second one on Prime Day for my son. I don\'t think you can go wrong with this mattress.Four months later - this mattress is still great! My Pittie races me up the stairs to the bedroom and jumps in the bed first. When I\'m at work, she sleeps on the bed. I love it. It\'s firm, yet comfy. I\'m never hot and my room is the hottest room in the house during summer. I\'ve recommended this mattress to all my friends and family. This has been an excellent value.14 months later - This mattress has held up well over time. It’s still firm yet with enough cushion to be very comfortable. It has continued to be an excellent value for the money paid. No backaches or shoulder pain after sleeping on it.

The best part is that this mattress is probably more comfortable than the last one and a fraction of the price.

It completely expanded within a few hours the same day I put it Up. The price was amazing for a Queen size, and the mattress itself comes with a linen fabric mattress cover that’s already on when arrived that can be unzipped & removed and machine washed.

It has three different layers of foam and is not a hybrid model. First is the 4.5"" high-density base support foam, next is the 1.5"" comfort foam, and on top is the 2"" gel-infused memory foam. This is the first foam mattress I\'ve ever owned, and I\'ll never go back to using the old box spring mattresses I\'ve had all my life. The first night I slept on it with only a single sheet covering over the mattress and I was stunned by how nice and comfortable it feels compared to everything I\'ve ever slept on before. The second day I installed the SafeRest Queen Size Premium Hypoallergenic Waterproof Mattress Protector, which is quite thin as it\'s a mattress protector and not a mattress ""pad."" I noticed no difference in how it feels in any way with this addition after using the bed all day and sleeping for 8 hours the second night. I believe it\'s so comfortable because of how your body sinks down into the foam slightly which supports your mass more uniformly than other surfaces \u200bcan. Don\'t get me wrong about this, it\'s still a quite firm mattress so it\'s not like you sink way down into it. I wish there was some way I could better express just how much I love my new Zinus mattress!!! This is like sleeping on a cloud! I\'ve read some negative reviews about people who\'ve removed the cover that comes on the mattress to wash it or for whatever reason and then went nuts complaining about loose fiberglass fragments they encountered afterward. I believe the tiny amount of fiberglass material built into the cover is part of the fire-retardant material that makes up the cover. I also believe the warning the manufacturer gives about not removing the cover is their way of being over-cautious about the possibility of customers coming into contact with fiberglass fibers if they do so, and anyone who has removed the cover has NO ONE TO BLAME BUT THEMSELVES for any problems they encounter for failing to follow the manufacturers instructions. I haven\'t removed the cover on mine but I did open the zipper about 12"" so that I could stick my bare forearm inside and rub it around to see for myself if there really was loose fiberglass fiber but I didn\'t notice any indication of this at all. My recommendation if you ever feel the need to remove the cover to wash it or whatever is remove the cover, deflate the air out of it and then CLOSE the zipper (without turning it inside out) and then arrange it around the center post of your washing machine. This will ensure the inside and outside of the cover won\'t come into contact with each other. Wash on a delicate setting, no bleach, then after removing it from the washing machine don\'t put it in the dryer, just lay it out on the floor to dry before putting it back on. The first picture was taken just 5 minutes after removing the mattress from the box and it\'s a full 7"". 36 hours later it had expanded to the full 8"" as can be seen in the second picture. After about 36 hours it was fully expanded and was very smooth and flat with square edges, and it looks almost perfect in every way. I have no idea how long this mattress might last, but after paying only $200 plus $18 in sales tax with free shipping it\'s easy and cheap enough to replace. I\'m still using my old bottom box frame but since the distance between the support slats is a full 6"" on my old base, I show in the third picture how I installed (with a few screws) some pieces of 1/4"" plywood to the top of it for better support for the foam mattress. I simply bought and installed 3 pieces of 1/4"" plywood at 24"" x 48"". I needed to cut the width of one piece for the foot end of the bed down 4"" so that the plywood would break over the supports slat of the old box base. If you choose to follow my example you may need to modify this to some extent depending on the spacing of the support slats of your base.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States June 7, 2021', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '3.0 out of 5 stars Measurements', 'author': 'Sharon R', 'rating': 3, 'content': 'For starters, it has been over 2 days now and it\'s still not ""fully"" expanded.

The ones by my feet are missing a good 2 and a half inches left, and the ones by my head are missing 3 inches.Another thing with the corners, some did come out of their flopped Era where it wasn\'t straight, but mostly flopped to the side, making a curve down. 3 out of the 4 corners are straightened.

Denham', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I bought this because my husband and I have been sleeping on a hand-me-down mattress for nearly 10 years and it was really bad on his back. He has some disc compression and his doctor recommended a medium firm to firm innerspring mattress with a memory foam top or mattress topper if we needed it to keep from getting sore on pressure points while we slept. This mattress just fit the bill (in more ways than one because of the great price). My husband is nearly 6\'5"" and weighs around 270. I have noticed him moving around so much less when he sleeps than he did on our old bed. When he does move around or just gets in or out of bed, I don\'t get bounced around like in our old bed because the springs are individual. The springs also keep him from creating a deep depression in the mattress that makes me have to fight all night against sliding into the hole. The memory foam layer is soft enough and thick enough to relieve pressure but thin enough to not negate the support of the more firm innerspring foundation. We had been using a 4 inch thick firm memory foam mattress topper on our old innerspring for the last 3 or 4 years. It was much better than without it, but created problems this one doesn\'t. The thicker foam compresses more and more as the night goes on and can leave us feeling like we\'re sleeping in a hole. It\'s actually alot harder to move around on that thick foam and I found myself waking up to change positions because it took a little too much effort to sleep through. And since there was no edge support, I\'d just slide off if I sat on the mattress close to the edge, or I\'d just feel like I was fighting sliding off when laying down close to the edge because of the slant created by my own weight. (I\'m smaller than the average female btw, but that was still a problem). None of those problems occur with the mattress. It seems to be the ideal thickness and firmness for us, and the edges are nicely supported while still being soft enough to not be uncomfortable while sitting on the edge of the bed. We\'ve been sleeping on it for almost a week, and he\'s still so much more comfortable while sleeping and when he wakes up in the morning. In the past, when we\'ve stayed in hotels or been guests in someone else\'s home, even if the bed seemed more comfortable at first, new problems would start to reveal themselves by about night 3, and he\'d start feeling discomfort somewhere else in his back or neck. Even if a mattress was better on the area that our home mattress irritated, it would end up causing discomfort in some other way. So far, this new mattress has remained comfortable for him longer than any other. I\'ll update if that changes. The mattress can be rotates head to foot, but not flipped be a the top is different than the bottom. We will rotate it regularly because of our size difference to try to keep the wear as even as possible. If it doesn\'t wear well or we become less happy with it, I\'ll update my review. So far I would recommend this mattress to anyone needing or wanting this type of support, especially if they have a smaller budget.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 31, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect mattress for the price!', 'author': 'Caity', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I purchased the Queen size 12inch and it is a great bang for your buck!

My colleague helped me set it up, and it was actually super easy. In fact, the hardest part was taking off the plastic lol! I wish we had did a video, but not knowing what to expect we were focused on just getting it set up.Please note it is heavy, nothing light about it. Also if it's not delivered directly to your home, you'll need a vehicle where the seats let down because it won't fit across the back seat.Now once we got the plastic off, and started unrolling it, it immediately started to rise. It looked like it fully inflated right away; but I like to follow directions, so I gave it the full weekend to settle before actually sleeping on it. There was no odd smell or anything.Now, I have horrible back issues, so I had explored reviews that suggested the mattress had good back support, and this one had several mentions of back pain relieve. Maybe my back issues are too extreme, but I haven't seen any real relieve. (I made another purchase to try and address this).However, I love the size of the mattress, and beyond my back I find it to be very comfortable.Now I don't like the lack of firmness around the edges, which appears to be extremely weak. Whenever I sit on the edge of the bed I feel like I'm going to fall off. The rest of the mattress is actually pretty firm. I feel well supported.

Khwaja', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'Like many of my fellow bipedal hominids of a certain age, I\'ve developed a degenerated lumbar disc and, being a side sleeper, have found I need a very firm mattress to keep my spine from bending and pinching through the night. I\'m taking the time to write this up in hopes it\'s of use to others with bad backs struggling to find a good night sleep and eliminate the source of their pain.My lower back pain was getting progressively worse for several years until I realized the problem might be the ""firm"" $2K mattress I was sleeping on. I went camping for a week, sleeping on just a 2"" memory foam topper on the ground; pain started to subside immediately. I\'ve since tried out a couple other ""firm"" mattresses in the $2-3K range and have come to the opinion that there\'s no such thing as a mattress that is both thick and also firm. The more material you add, the more sag you\'re going to get. Period. Companies would obviously rather sell you a thicker, more expensive mattress, but if you want a truly firm mattress it must be thin.This LUCID mattress is unusually firm; firmer than I had expected and firmer than I had even hoped for. It\'s definitely not as plush as thicker options. But it is GREAT for my back, and starting the day pain-free is the most important thing. It was a little too firm for my partner, so we added a 1"" latex topper which is nearly as supportive and quite a bit more comfortable. I would recommend this combo.The only setup I\'ve found that is better for my back is the aforementioned firm 2"" memory foam mattress topper right on the floor. That\'s the setup I use for car camping and I never sleep better than on one of those. It\'s perfect in terms of both support and comfort, at least for me @ 5\'8"", 150lb. The downside is I\'ve found those toppers only last a couple years of daily use before softening to the point your hips start to feel the ground beneath. If you try the topper-only strategy, make sure it\'s high-density as they\'re not all the same. I got mine at Costco.The reason I gave this item 4 stars instead of 5 is that they obnoxiously list it as 60x80"" (true queen) but both the box and tag list its true size, which is 59""x79"". So the description is misleading (perhaps even deliberately so, as getting those numbers right would have been a trivial task). I\'d rather pay 3% more for a mattress that fits both my bed frame and my sheets. 1"" matters when you\'re sharing a queen. I ended up returning the mattress for this reason alone despite it otherwise being a keeper.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States July 3, 2022', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': ""5.0 out of 5 stars Finally, A Full Night's Sleep"", 'author': 'P. Thompson', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Got this during Prime Day to replace a couple of foam toppers I have been using on a hand-me-down traditional full mattress and box springs set that is still too hard for my taste despite being broken down. The two toppers were about 5 inches total of just ""memory foam"" and weren\'t really getting the job done. I am 62, overweight, and have arthritis in many joints, including my hips. I sleep mainly on my left side but at times, my left hip would hurt and I would end up on my back during the night. This caused my back to hurt and my legs to go numb. Not to mention apnea episodes with multiple wakings during the night.To be honest, I really didn\'t pay much attention to the inches and just saw the good price - got mine for a lot less than what it\'s going for now. When I got it and saw that it was only 5 inches, I worried. Especially when I read on the company website that it was designed to transition kids from the crib to a full size bed. I was afraid it wouldn\'t be firm enough to give the support I needed. Happy to say that assessment was very, very wrong.I got it out of the box at around 11:00 am and it was fully decompressed by the time I was ready for bed 12 hours later. There was no strong smell that I could detect and I am very sensitive to smells. It\'s firm enough to keep my hip from hitting bottom yet cushy enough to keep me pain free. I woke up on my side, exactly as I had gone to sleep. Basically, I slept like a rock and woke up feeling a lot better than I usually do.I would definitely recommend this mattress if you are looking for a replacement. However, considering how the full mattress is suddenly going for more than twice what I paid for mine during Prime Day, you might want to check around for a better price if you\'re looking for a full.By the way, this mattress works just fine atop a traditional mattress and box springs.

I had purchased one of those bed-in-a-box mattresses about 2 years ago and never really loved it. I sleep on my right side all of the time, and I was getting very bad muscle spasms on my left side. I was actually sleeping with a heating pad draped over my side to try and at least limit the spasms as best I could. I assumed it was from sleeping in the same position night after night. Then I researched it and found that side sleepers like me need a mattress that isn\'t too firm. So rather than buying a whole new mattress I purchased this topper. I unfurled it mid-morning and by bedtime it was ready to go. WOW!! Talk about an amazing night\'s sleep! Not just that but when I woke up my body wasn\'t sore at all, which was so welcome since I also suffer from very chronic back pain. It didn\'t solve my back pain since it\'s aggravated by other activities and by being tall, but when I lay on my bed now I just feel completely enveloped with comfort and relief. As for the pain in my side, that\'s almost completely gone already. I simply can\'t believe what a difference this 3"" topper has made to my well being.As for the odor, my bed is made using a bamboo mattress pad, then a fitted sheet over that. After 5 days of sleeping on this I can still smell a very slight odor from the topper. I am hyper-sensitive to odors because I am a chronic migraine sufferer, so when I lay down my ears start to ring which is usually a sign a migraine is coming. But it hasn\'t yet caused a headache so to me the odor isn\'t enough to put me over the edge in that way. And I\'m assuming that over time even this slight odor will dissipate. Perhaps since I didn\'t air the topper out for the recommended 48 hours after opening it and I then encased it in both the mattress pad and fitted sheet that it may take a little more time for the off-gassing to cease.One thing I\'m thinking might happen is the topper may eventually bow in where I sleep but I can always turn it 180 degrees around, and then after it bows in again turn it over and continue to rotate it.I recommend you take a chance on this!

In my mind the $189.99 product offered what I needed at a good price point. Their $159.99 product looked good also, but I decided to buy the more expensive one. As a bonus, the shipping was free. When the mattress arrived, I put it on the bed and checked it out. Upon close examination I found out it was the cheaper 2 foam layer version and not the more expensive 3 foam layer version that I had ordered. I found the packing list item number and checked it against the model number on the Amazon product pages. The item number shipped to me was in fact the less expensive mattress - not the more expensive mattress I paid for. The fulfillment center had shipped the wrong product.Now here is the interesting part and the quick solution by the vendor. I decided to to see if sending the wrong mattress back or just keeping the cheaper mattress made the most sense. I made a simple lay down test on the mattress to see if it would adjust to my size and weight and if I was comfortable enough and to my surprise the incorrect mattress seemed to be just fine for what I needed. After some exchanges with the vendor - with submitting pictures of the incorrect product number on the box - I asked the vendor to credit my account for the price difference for the cheaper mattress that was sent. The vendor immediately sent a refund back to my account. So don't be afraid to buy from the vendor of the Marsail Foam Queen Mattress product. I believe they will fix any issues that might pop up.In conclusion, the mattress that I kept is of good quality, is in fact medium firm, but has enough give in the top foam layer of foam to be comfortable for my size and weight and hopefully lasts a good long time. At this price point, I consider it a bargain. Add the very good customer support and It's all good for me. I rated this four stars based on the quality vs price of the product and vendor solution for the shipping error. The vendor response and quick refund for the shipping error is actually five stars, but there is no way for me to list that separately.

The instructions said to open within 72 hours of delivery, and I opened both within ten minutes of them being left at my front door. I suspect one sat in the Amazon warehouse longer than the other mattress. Not worth it to return an expanded mattress to Amazon, but a bit disappointed in the inconsistency.

When you pull the king out you have to turn the mattresses (which is what we intended to do anyway) but then you kind of have to stuff them together and they hang a bit on the bottom. I’m still keeping these because we are mainly using the bed as a twin, so we will make it work. Just wanted to note that for others who are looking for that purpose. I would say that if I was using them just as a twin and not stacked, I would want to go thicker. The 5” is pretty thin, but fine for a kids bed.

That is significantly better too.I didn't think I would recommend this bed at all. But it's actually quite nice. Especially for the price.Previous review: I got this product 3.5 days ago. I opened the package within 2 hrs of its delivery. I allowed 72 hrs for it to expand. I ordered the 12in mattress so it would have more cushion and be less firm than the 10 in. It expanded to 11 inches at most. The information included in the package says the product may very up to 1.5inches, which seems like alot.The springs go all the way to the top. The picture led me to believe that the springs would stop at the first seam and would have a good layer foam on top of that. The foam is very thin. This is essentially a spring mattress. Not a hybrid mattress.I have yet to sleep on it, since I was letting it expand, but it feels very firm and lacks padding to soften the spring pressure.I will be contacting the seller as soon as I figure out how.I will update after I sleep on it and get more information from the seller."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 5, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars I LOVE IT', 'author': 'Shanice Lewis', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I let it expand fully for 2-3 days, it went to the full 12 inches.Careful not to poke a hole when opening the packaging.It’s super soft and firm at the same time.

I highly recommend it.I have held off on writing a review for this mattress because I felt it was necessary to sleep on it for an extended period of time to give it the most fair and accurate review. My wife and I purchased this mattress over a year ago, in November 2017.After going to all the local stores, from big box to mom and pop, my wife and I found ourselves with a problem: we could tell which mattresses were soft and which were firm, but aside from that we didn\'t really feel much difference apart from the price tag- almost all of which exceeded a thousand dollars, with some approaching two grand. That\'s quite an outlay of cash.So, going off reviews on Amazon we took the leap on this Zinus Extra Firm iCoil 12 inch king mattress. We also purchased a steel foundation upon which to set the mattress in our bed frame. The box arrived a little beat up, but my wife and I muscled it into the house and carried it upstairs together. It\'s a two person job, but not impossible. We set the rolled up mattress on our guest bed and carefully cut away the plastic so the bed would unroll. (Pro tip: Don\'t stand between the mattress and the wall. You might get pinched) We followed the directions and let the mattress sit undisturbed for 2 or 3 days so it could fully expand. After which time, we moved it into our bedroom.It\'s now more than one year on and I feel qualified to report on the mattress. It is firm, but not rock hard. This is obviously subjective, so all I can say is that you know a firm mattress when you lay on one, and this is a firm mattress but is still comfortable. I\'m a side and stomach sleeper, and my wife is a back sleeper. I\'m 5\'11"", 230lbs, and we\'ll just say that my wife is plus sized and leave it at that. The mattress supports both of us fine, and a year later has no depressions, dips, sags or problem areas. The last time I did laundry I snapped some photos of the mattress which I have posted above. You\'ll notice the mattress is still even and flat, even after a year of nightly use.I purchased this mattress myself, with my own money, have no relationship with the manufacturer, and am receiving nothing in return for writing this review. I just know how difficult it is take the leap of purchasing something like this over the internet, so I thought I\'d write a review to help people in a similar situation my wife and I found ourselves in last year.This mattress was an excellent purchase, I\'ve recommended it to friends, and if you\'re in the market for a fairly priced firm mattress, I can recommend it to you as well.

It was indeed extra firm so I bought a topper and I figured because of the low price it wouldn’t last long. I’ve bought IKEA mattresses (around the same budget) and within 3 months there was sagging/ sinking so I expected to get the same quality but nope. Had this bed for a year and NEVER sagged! Firmness stayed intact and looks like a luxury mattress! Win win.Fast forward a year later, I moved into a bigger place and could buy a bigger mattress so I decided to give away this twin one and spurge on a more expensive mattress. What a mistake that was! I tried the purple ($1100), the winkbed firmest option ( $1300) and both mattress I would sink in and be sleeping in the mattress versus on top. The purple I kind of expected it because it isn’t advertised as firm but I was intrigued by trying a new material. My friend has the purple and loves it but he likes medium firmness. So nothing against Purple, their customer service was fantastic! The mattress has a very interesting feeling when sleeping on it. They do have other more expensive options and their customer service is great so I’d definitely recommend them. Now as for Winkbed, stay away! With their advertised “firmer mattress” I was sinking in as soon as getting it, I waited days hoping it just hadn’t decompress and nope, it has gotten worse. So bad that I’m taking painkillers everyday to deal with the body aches of sleeping inside the mattress. The company although they advertise a “say nothing and get a refund” I have been emailing them explaining my situation for days, and they have yet to process a refund. They give me copy-and-paste like responses that have nothing to do with my issues like saying it will get softer in time when I’m not saying it is hard, I’m saying I’m sinking in. So how will it getting softer help me? So my experience with Winkbed customer service have been awful. No empathy, no responsibility (think they sent a defective mattress), and not keeping to their word. Also, I tried to leave a review on their website and you can’t. So makes me wonder who can leave reviews on their site? Anywho, stay away.After two failed “splurge” mattress purchases and one awful customer service experience (Winkbed), I decided to go back to the bed that was truly firm! Sometimes the “you pay what you get for” isn’t true. I got a way better, true to firmness, no sagging price at 1/4 of the cost with this mattress!Save yourself money, if you need a true firm mattress, and get this mattress.Recommend ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 13, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars I replaced a $1000 name branded 18 inch deep mattress with this.', 'author': 'tlcstat', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""My wife had two complete Knee replacement in three months.

If it is full body support, isolation from another person that may be sleeping, a very comfortable foam top, a ridiculous low price, a fast delivery, and a easy install that you are looking for, this mattress might just do the job.

Review September 2017 with follow up April 2021 at the end."", 'author': 'Jan H.', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""Eighteen months ago due to severe spinal stenosis I gave up my once awesome but currently sagging 20 year old beauty rest mattress in favor of sleeping directly on my board like box springs with a mattress topper. For a while it helped but at 68 years old I finally realized I needed at least a little bit of cushion or give. After reviewing pretty much every mattress on the planet for the last six months I decided on an inexpensive bed in a box type of mattress. I didn't want to spend a lot in case it didn't work out. I have had coil spring mattresses for over 60 years so I decided to stick with that familiar feel. However, I definitely needed the firmest mattress I could find… a step above the wooden board I had been sleeping on. Last Monday, July 28th I ordered the Zinus performance plus extra firm 10 inch queen mattress. I received it three days later on Thursday shipped from Amazon. It came in a long box about 90 pounds. I maneuvered it from the porch on its end all the way to my bedroom. Not too bad for a 68 year old woman with a bad back! I set it on the bed and unpacked it with no problem. I slowly cut the wrapper off as instructed and the mattress immediately started inflating and expanding. The smell was very mild and reminded me of dried hay. 10 hours later when I went to bed the smell was completely gone. Before I made up the bed I laid on the mattress for a few minutes to test the firmness. It is very firm but with that tiny bit of give that you get from a spring mattress. Since the 10 inch style has very little padding on top of the springs I decided to use my 3 inch Novafirm gel memory foam topper from Costco. If I was a little younger and not so sore I probably wouldn't need it. I also have a very nice bamboo made in the USA mattress pad that I'm using on top of that. Now the results. These last four nights I feel like I died and went to heaven! I have not slept this well in over two years. I feel like I am sleeping in a $2000 bed! I am not waking up six or seven times a night and it is sooo comfortable. Can't tell you how grateful I am to have found this bed and at such a good price. I was so apprehensive about this purchase and am so relieved and happy about the results! I know this was a very long review but I wanted all of you out there to have enough information in one review to help you make a decision. Also you already know my age but I am 5 foot four and 168 pounds if that helps. Also if you buy the bed directly from Amazon it comes a bit faster. Amazon prime got it to me in 3 days but I had to pay $20 tax. If you order it from Amazon and pick vendor Sleep Revolution( which is like the store front of Zinus) to order it from it takes about 7 to14 days and you don't pay tax. But I wanted it really fast. I just want to end this review with a huge thank you to Zinus for making a product that has so vastly improved the quality of my life!!................... Today is April 21, 2021 and it has been about 3 1/2 years since I bought this wonderful mattress. A lot of times you will see a review for a product and then never hear from that consumer again. But I love this bed so much I felt I should offer a follow up. First of all this mattress is in exactly the same shape as when it was new. I can detect no wear of any kind or any sagging. I am now 72 years old and still have my back issues but I have never slept so well in any other bed that I have owned. I still can’t believe that I paid less than $250 for a “bed in a box” coil spring mattress of this quality. I own the 10 inch mattress and as I stated I at first used a 3 inch memory foam topper but I ended up getting rid of it because foam is just too hot for me. Besides the top of this bed is soft enough even though the mattress is super firm and I use a bamboo USA made plush mattress pad cover which is perfect. This combination allows the mattress to breathe and the whole sleeping experience is cool and comfortable rather than hot and suffocating. I think the problem with foam is your body heat does not dissipate very well and I am a very hot sleeper. So in closing I will just say this. This mattress is worth every penny. If you are looking for a very firm bed that is really comfortable and sleeps cool look no further. I hope this follow up review is helpful."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 4, 2017', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Skeptical at first, FIRM BELIEVER now!! Hope to order another one in 12 months!', 'author': 'Liz G.', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I WAS RELUCTANT AT FIRST! I am going to write an unusual review. When we first took the mattress out of the bed and I lay down on it, my first thought was, ""Oh NO! What have I done? This mattress is like laying on a padded brick."" It took less then 24 hours for the memory foam to completely fluff up. So I gave it another day. And another. It was just SO FIRM! My old bed was like a soft billowy cloud that just wrapped around you. So I called Amazon to check on their return policy. They told me to wait a week and see how I felt, and then we could initiate the return process. I AM SO GLAD I WAITED! I now LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this bed!! Here\'s why: I SLEEP LIKE A BABY THAT SLEEPS THROUGH THE NIGHT! I have never slept so good in my whole life! I didn\'t realize it until about 2 weeks went by. I realized, I\'m not getting up at night to briefly check the alarm clock time, go to the bathroom etc. No. It is literally a SLEEP MAGNET! I lie down on it, and 5 minutes later, I\'m out cold! No more tossing and turning to fall asleep. NO MORE INSOMNIA! I find I am sleeping about exactly 7 hours straight without waking up once.I don\'t even notice if my husband is beside me in the bed or not. If he moves, I am not aware at all. Even though I was sleeping great,for two weeks I just couldn\'t seem to part with our old mattress. I kept having doubts like, ""but what if it is just a bit TOO firm? Will I regret tossing our old mattress?"" (It was still in our hall. I know I sound like Goldilocks here, but to be absolutely certain we could trash our old mattress once and for all, I took this mattress off, put it in the hall where our old one was, and put the old one back on. The next two nights were the worse sleep nights of my life.Though my old bed is like falling into a fluffy hammock, I realize now that I have not slept hardly at all for years! No telling how many times I wake up at night! So I switched back again to the Zinus mattress. And I also went ahead and shelled out a little bit more money and added an extra layer of padding with a Sleep Innovations 4-Inch Dual Layer Mattress Topper - Gel Memory Foam and Plush Fiber also found on Amazon ($184.10). That made the bed absolutely PERFECT. Very firm support, but a soft topper. If you have bad back issues, or trouble sleeping this bed is for you! It may be a bit of an adjustment at first, but wait a few days, or add just one more layer of foam as we did. In fact at first, my back was just slightly sore, but that\'s because it was used to being curved like the letter ""C"" at night. Now every part of my spine is firmly supported, and zero pain anywhere. I am 51 yo, and wake up feeling refreshed. My bed is also on platform risers, and because the bed is perfectly FLAT, it doubles as a workspace (wrapped all our Christmas presents on it). It\'s easy to fold laundry, etc. because it is firm and perfect height. We both love this bed so much, I hope by next Christmas to replace our Queen size bed in the other bedroom. My 11 yo son loves it too, and now he wishes he could have one too. Conclusion: It may seem to firm at first, but give it a few days. Your body may be readjusting. Now I realize it\'s the best bed we ever bought! The price is totally reasonable and so convenient having it delivered to your door! PS -- This mattress also has individually wrapped coils, so you don\'t have to worry about springs going bad and that adds to it\'s firmness. I think next time, we may try the green tea 10"" memory foam only (no springs) as it reviews as being firm, but probably slightly less than this one. Still, I am a converted believer now in this firm bed.Last thoughts: HOTEL OWNERS/MANAGERS should order these beds! With concern over bedbugs etc., stains etc., these beds are so reasonably priced, you could afford to replace mattresses several times a year if necessary. They are perfect on either platform or boxsprings too.

Also be aware that when you cut the plastic wrap and air is sucked in it might spring out suddenly.

Each corner was dented in and it caused the middle to be much higher than the rest of the bed.2. It advertised this mattress as a 6.5 between firmness and softness. We needed some sort of firmness so that I could breastfeed, yet be soft enough to be comfortable. I haven’t found firmness. After sitting (or applying too much pressure at pressure points of the body) I sink so far in that my MIDDLE BACK feels the mattress. This also makes it extremely hard to breastfeed. When trying to adjust, the baby sinks into the pressure spots (as I apply more pressure than she does due to adult vs child). Even after NUMEROUS pillows, there is just no support, especially since the mattress never evened out.3. The last 2 nights of sleeping on this mattress, I’ve awaken with pain in one of my legs. (I have to sleep on my side to breastfeed and I alternate throughout the night). And the pain hasn’t died down. This mattress was advertised to ease pain, not cause it- but I’m having the opposite effect.Ultimately, we will be trying to return this ASAP.Update!: we decided to keep it a little longer and allow it to shape/form correctly.We placed it on an actual bed support and it was immediately a change for the better. I’m not sure if all the cushion on carpeted floor was the reason, but it was night & day after putting it on a platform bed.Super comfortable, and the movement doesn’t effect everyone sleeping in the bed. Reminds me of that wine commercial mattress. I haven’t done wine, but I’ve done a glass of water and it held place while I got off the bed. It hugs your body without making you feel like you’re sinking into the mattress. Super comfortable & the mattress shaped itself out in a few days after my initial review.No body pains, better sleep, and even my husband doesn’t snore as much or as loud when he does snore. Definitely such a difference from when he falls asleep on the couch watching tv. SO grateful we gave it time & kept it!

Shipping packaging: arrived in cardboard box. Inside, mattress is vacuum-compressed within thick, clear plastic. It is rather heavy (70+ lbs) for its boxed size, so have help ready to lift, etc.2. Unboxing: make sure your bed frame is ready, before opening the plastic vacuum wrap! Once the seal is broken, it expands quite rapidly, and is unwieldy.3. Expansion: 3-5 hours minimum is recommended (by manufacturer). We allotted about 7 hours, before we slept on it, and it seemed OK. There was little to no odor.4. Initial sleep: of course, any new mattress requires a bit of “getting used to”. First sensation when laying upon it is one of slight envelopment. Not a negative, just a bit more initial “give”, than we were accustomed to. Support seemed to be in a 6+ range. Welcome lack of pressure points, particularly when side-sleeping. Back-sleeping was extra restful, for me.5. Consecutive sleeps: after a few nights acclimating, our initial comfort assessments are unaltered. It does feel a slightly warmer, than any previous mattress, but this is easily adapted. Rolling over does take considerably more effort, but due to the comfort level, we found ourselves rolling much less often.6. Incidentals: There is little edge support, with this mattress. If you frequently sit on the edge of your bed, you may find this awkward or challenging. As this type is less rigid than a traditional mattress, moving it around (to do periodic rotation, for example) is more laborious – almost a “dead weight” experience.7.

It\'s expected, so have a fan ready and air it out.- Firm version of memory foam (Perfect for bigger guys like me) But I have a hunch it breaks in over time.- Quality seemed very nice.I just received this mattress yesterday ( 8/5/2015 ). The packaging was as expected, the Cardboard box was in rough shape but the heavy duty plastic on the inside was untouched. I\'m a 6\'2"" 230lb athletic man that spends most of my free time in the gym, so getting the package onto my bed frame by myself was no problem at all. To a regular or smaller person, you might need an extra hand carrying the 90+lb package.Upon opening, I cut the plastic and everything went as expected. The mattress inflated itself within 30 minutes with the corners lagging behind (I just hit the corners with my hand to fluff them up and help them catch up) . I let it sit for 24 hours before laying on it. The smell is strong, but it\'s not as bad as people make it out to be. Looking at the other reviews, some of these people must have had a bad mattress, or simply can\'t take a little odor for a few days (they might be sensitive).Here\'s the biggest point... The mattress is a very firm version of memory foam. Right out of the box the mattress doesn\'t give in as much as you may think. It\'s perfect for someone like me because, like I\'ve said, I\'m 230 lbs and athletic. This thing offers the perfect support for me, giving in to my heavy points and supporting my lighter areas yet I can see somebody who\'s much lighter having issues. I say to those people, give the mattress time to break in. I\'ll update this in a few months with a follow up.Tonight will be the first night I sleep on it, and I couldn\'t be more excited. The 10 minutes I spend laying on it this morning almost made me fall right asleep again. I\'ll keep this post updated because there seems to be a lot of confusion on this mattress.* Off topic *The first one I ordered got mixed up in the mail due to the carrier, therefor I got my mattress 3 days late. Amazon\'s customer service was perfect and I couldn\'t have asked for a better crew to solve the problem.** UPDATE (08/07/2015) **- Last night was the first night that I slept on the mattress and I can honestly say I had a great night sleep. I didn\'t wake up in the middle of the night at all. I was cool all night (Granted I had a 17"" box fan blowing directly over me) and the only time I got hot was when my lady friend came over earlier. I\'m usually a very hot sleeper and people who complain about the heat of this thing should invest in a fan. Even without the fan it was very cool at first, but it did start warming up slightly after 30 minutes or so of laying in the same spot - but it wasn\'t that bad.I can say that I\'m very pleased with my first night on this thing.*** UPDATE 08/24/2015Sleeping on this thing has been a pleasure. It\'s not revolutionizing, but it\'s much more comfortable than my last mattress. The smell is pretty much gone although it did take awhile. The smell was honestly not that bad and the only way you could really smell it was if you stuck your nose in the mattress. I don\'t wake up in the middle of the night anymore from tossing and turning. That\'s a huge plus for me because on my old mattress It felt like I had a cycle of waking up at 3 or 4am from tossing and turning. The mattress is still very firm, but like I said before, it\'s perfect for me because I\'m big and heavy enough to actually sink in a bit.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 6, 2015', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great buy... cannot say enough about this mattress......', 'author': 'Cary R. Hitchings', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""UPDATE: 4 years later…. This is still the best mattress for me. No back pain. Still like new. Conforms to my body. It will indent some, (literally have had to turn it 2 times in 4 years) but all you have to do is turn it. And the indented part goes away. It’s truly the best mattress. I took a risk buying a lower cost mattress and I am so glad I did, better than any $1000.00 + mattress I have ever slept on. I bought the 10 inch for my daughter and she LOVES it. First purchase had a smell that went away (see below) but my daughters didn’t smell at all. All the luxuries of an expensive mattress for a much lower price.ORIGINAL REVIEW: Ok, so my pics are of an unfinished bedroom, and a bed that I just painted white from black. So the bed only has sheets on it. As you can see, this mattress is 14 inches and is big. It's all of every bit of 14 inches and started rising before I could get it all of the way out of the plastic. It was at maximum within 5 minutes. The pillows... I LOVE. We bought an original box spring to go with it, and I have to raise my leg high and climb up in it. My dog cannot jump on it or get off by herself. I should have gotten a thin box spring, because now my mattress is way higher than the bedside tables. But I DO NOT CARE... I LOVE LOVE this mattress. The ONLY bad thing is the smell. The smell that came with mine was very strong, and even stronger in the pillows. So bad, I had to throw the pillows outside of my room to sleep. So tonight I will try to put the pillows in the dryer with softener sheets to see if that helps. I have slept on this mattress for 3 nights so far. I can tell a HUGE different. I have lower back pain, and bad hip pain that will shoot down my leg while sleeping. I have also been doing manual labor... and I thank god for this mattress, as I know my back would have been worse on my other mattress. If I lay on my back, it conforms to my back and feels great. If I lay on my side, I barely get hip pain. I don't toss and turn nearly as much in this. This is close to firm, but nothing like a firm mattress with coils would be. I have not noticed it being hot at all. And I live in Texas and it's mid summer. I just hope the smell goes away. It seems to slowly be going away. I probably should have not covered it right away and let it air out for a few days, but I just couldn't wait to get into it. I am so happy with this purchase. I feel like the regular price is steal, and I got it on prime day... which was even more of a steal. If I am already sleeping in this bed so well from day one.... I cannot imagine how much better it will get. I was worried being over weight (215) that it wouldn't support me as well... IT DOES! I feel like I am sleeping on a mattress that cost 5k. I would say (being that my hips are so bad) that this does well for pressure points. Pillows are kind of thin... but I like thinner pillows... and they seem very nice. Once the smell is gone, I will use them. Oh also.... mine is a queen... and I bought a queen box spring. The mattress is about 3-4 inches wider than the box spring is so I just centered it. I love that this mattress fills in the gaps on my bed. My pillow will no longer fall behind the mattress as I sleep.***UPDATE***The smell is still there. I had to put in a Fabrese plug in. I do not understand why this mattress still smells. It’s almost a mildew smell. I love this mattress. I’m not sure what to do with the smell. Sucks I took a star away for it. It still sleeps perfect and I enjoy getting into it. I just want the smell gone.***ANOTHER UPDATE****Smell is gone. It has taken a year or more for the smell to be completely gone. But worth it. I have had it for two years now and it’s amazing. Others posted is sags. I weigh a lot, not gonna lie, and mine doesn’t sag. It did indent a little, so I just turned it and it goes away. Nothing like a regular mattress that permanently indents.I still love this mattress and my back thanks me for getting it. It’s not soft, but soft enough. When you first get in, it feels firm, but the foam slowly confirms to your body and is great for back issues!Soft mattresses hurt my back. This mattress gives perfect support.People that got one that sink, got a lemon. This mattress is tough and holds its shape.I would buy again. And may for other rooms.I don’t use the pillows. Too soft. I had to buy Ikea contoured pillows. They work best for me.I have gotten hot on it, but I think it’s me and not the mattress (I’m 50) so I bought a Bedfan, and it solved my issues.Seriously .... worth it to buy this!

Having been a \'box spring & coil mattress guy my 60+ years\' I was easy prey for the store sales guys, yet I resisted the easy path of plunking down $3 ~ $4 grand and after reading volumes of comparative details and thousands of reviews, would up here. For about 1/10th the cost it was well worth the risk. I even called Classic Brands cust svc and chatted about what to expect between this & the hybrid model that\'s near the same price. My head just can\'t wrap itself around a brutally squished up bunch of springs and foam popping up to a sturdy full size without any long term effect on those springs turning mushy over time, but I can better imagine how squished up foam by itself can possibly be reformed to a strong enough support.My UPS guy had never delivered one of these before and he\'s real interested in what we think after installed. The two of us pretty good sized guys wrestled the very heavy, pretty beat up, nasty, dirty box into the house together without any serious injury. After that, and much room prep + new platform bed set up, I managed to push the box across wood floors into the bedroom myself, carefully knifed away the mangled box, keeping the inner plastic cover intact, then wrestled / rolled the behemoth up onto the platform and into position for the grand opening. Carefully sliced through the cover while watching the mattress come to life and expand rapidly while it rolled itself out nicely onto the bed frame. about 30 seconds into it, I realized it was upside down and fast, drastic action was in order. I had my dainty wife push against the bottom of one side while I flipped my side up and over (thankfully it wasn\'t far from the wall on her side), then dashed around and re-slide the beast onto the bed once again, this time the correct side up. We were prepared to let it expand over night, but it was already fully expanded to it\'s 12"" size within a couple hours, so we gave it a whirl the first night. As many other reviewers noted, it\'s firm, yet also plush at the same time. Medium/firm is what I\'d call it. I sink in slightly, enough to make my back feel somewhat cocooned, but it\'s effortless to roll onto my side as well. I\'ve been a \'firm\' mattress mostly side sleeper guy forever, but this mattress actually lets me sleep very well on my back or side as I feel like. I know I\'m changing position a lot less and when I do, the wife doesn\'t notice at all. We\'re both sleeping a lot sounder now, want to stay in bed longer when waking up as it feels so good and the occasional tango between the sheets has not been diminished in any way :-). Also, there\'s no heat issue for me, maybe even cooler for me than the past spring coil mattress. A tiny con may be that the edge is not as rigid as my past mattress, so it\'s less comfy to sit on the edge to put on your socks as you do dip down a bit, but that\'s no prob for us as we\'ve switched to the foot of the bed for that where there\'s extra support platform from the frame that makes sock activity very easy. Perhaps these are not for everyone, but I\'m 100% sold, as is the wife.

After 24 hours, I set it up and so far two nights of sleep. I have yet to experience any bodily pain and I am sleeping through the night. The mattress I used to have was a Tempur-pedic and it was 20 years old.. I definitely got my moneys worth out of that mattress and the new one feels great! The biggest thing that I’m impressed with is I only paid $400 for the new mattress versus $4000 for a new Tempur-pedic. The cool gel mattress has yet to get warm which is another thing I needed. I like a cool mattress. Because of the thickness it has a firm feel but not too firm and your body will form to the bed. All I can say is I’m glad I went with this option don’t shy away from this.

Time will tell if the box springs will sag, for now I could not be happier, and the price is incredible. Stitching, construction, etc. all see first rate. The one issue to consider, a hybrid bed will not have the firm edges of a regular coil spring mattress, so if you typically sit on the edge of the bed (to put shoes on or ???), or if you role to the very edge of the bed, the foam and gel layers will not support you the way a firm coil spring would, so you may end up on your butt or role off the side.

As I had no real choice I had to use it for the night. OMG so soft, but firm. I have sciatica so I was hoping this would help.

The only complaint I have is the mattress doesn\'t really have a firm ""edge"" to sit on, I have to kind of roll into the middle.

We decided we wanted to try to upgrade from a queen sized bed to a king sized bed. My wife has degenerative discs in her lower back and experiences a lot of back pain. We have 2 small dogs that sleep with us. Just wasn't enough room in the queen bed to allow her to get comfortable. So we wanted to try out a king sized bed on the cheap. We bought a used king sized bed that shockingly matches the rest of bedroom furniture. We read great reviews about this mattress. We got it. I opened it and let it decompress for a full week as the instructions stated. The mattress seemed a little flimsy to me so I had serious doubts. We bought a metal box frame and assembled it so it could fit inside our bedframe. The metal box frames seems to give more support than the old wooden ones. We've been sleeping on the new mattress for 5 weeks now. I have to say we are shocked with the quality. It is firm every where except the very edges of the mattress. Very supportive. We both sleep much better than we were sleeping on our less than 5 year old orthopedic coil spring mattress. It really is comfortable. My wife is able to sleep soundly on it rather than waking up every hour or two and then struggling to get back to sleep. Caveat. I do not think this mattress will last more than 5 years. I could be mistaken. However, at the price we paid, I will still be highly satisfied if it lasts even 4 years. We paid $1,500 for our last mattress and never slept well on it after a year. The mattress before that lasted 14 years (King Koil). I think all in we spent $1,000 including the bed frame, the box spring, mattress, sheets, pillow cases, pillows, blanket and comforter.

I am thinking that maybe people are ending up with different mattress that just have the same coverings? Or maybe different mattress sizes are being reviewed differently?Anyway here is my experience with a FULL mattress. This is the 4th bed in a box mattress I have purchased over the last 7 years for both myself and my kids. I\'m 5\'10"" and 235 so ""dense"" would be a good word. I have several herniated discs, bad shoulders and hips. A soft bed is agony. I\'m a back and side sleeper.DAY 1 - Arrived no issues, securely packaged. Inflates within 1 hour to 11.5 inches approx, nowhere near 13 inches. Other than that no apparent issues. Only the faintest odor compared to previous mattresses I have purchased.NITE 1- Was going to let it expand and out-gas for a full day but it seemed perfectly ready to go within only a few hours so I swapped it out with my existing.I find it pleasantly ""firm"" with about 2 inches of soft give on the top. Meaning if I push my hand into it, my hand easily goes in about 2 inches, typical memory foam feel, then hits strong resistance. If I kneel or stand on it, I can clearly feel the springs compacting and I sink in about 4 inches. Laying on back is great. Laying on side my hips don\'t sink in as much as I\'d like but I bet it loosens up over time. Overall it is really comfortable, just what I wanted. Seems to be pretty well made. I can\'t tell top end expensive from low end, only crap from well done and this seems pretty good. Day 1.Morning 1 - I slept really well. Really comfortable. Still woke up stiff and sore but I think this was not so much from the mattress, just how I always wake up. I bet this gets better.ONE BIG ISSUE though. There is zero edge support. Literally none. If sit on the edge the edge squishes all the way down flat and I bottom out. Well maybe within 2 inches of literally bottoming out. But the effect is that as you swing your legs out of bed and start to roll out, the side gives way and you literally flop out of bed. That is so weird because if I sit 6"" back from the edge, no problems. Still firm. I guess the springs don\'t go all the way to the edge? Remember I have a FULL. Queen, King may be different.So aside from having to be careful when exiting my bed, I\'m not dissatisfied in the least because I wanted a decent cheap firm mattress and I got it. I\'ll post updates periodically. I\'m planning to get a high end mattress in a year or two so as long as this ~ 200 mattress holds up that long, it\'s a win.Morning 3 - Still hasn\'t inflated to 13"". It is maybe barely 12"". Not a big deal. I find that once the foam top gets squished down by my body, it is quite firm. No trouble getting to sleep and not waking up in the night with pain as I did with my previous mattress. Still waking up stiff and sore though. Again, different than my previous mattress though, this is more like stiff and sore if I were to sleep on the floor. LOL.

Due to its outrageously cheap pricetag i wanted to wait to make sure it was going to hold up before posting a review.Before buying this I spent MONTHS researching mattresses. It was really doing my head in, did I want spring could? Gel? Soft firm? Financially it's best to buy on the internet, but you have to really just hope it's what you want, so it was a difficult decision. The day was fast approaching that I needed to have made that decision when I found this one. It was just about the best reviewed in any price range, plus it was EVERYTHING, individually wrapped coils, memory foam AND gel, plus 13 inches seemed nice and thick. So i ordered it. A year later i still cant say enough good things about it. If id paid a thousand bucks for it i would still be happy, but i didnt, i paid $237!!! If you have been shopping around you know you can barely get sheets for that price! I still cant believe it almost a year later.It as plush, but still very firm, you sink into the plush but supported by the springs. We spend a LOT of time in bed, way more than the average person, and its standing up to it just fine. The spring provide enough bounce for sexy time, but I am still undisturbed when he gets out of bed, well it is a little disturbing when I realize he isn't in bed, because that's how good it is, I never even feel him get up. I will say this, the guy who delivers it is going to be giving you a REALLY dirty look, do not expect any favors from him, he does not like you much that day. The boxbis big, cumbersome and very heavy. Opening the box and watching It spring to life was mot even close to as exciting as it had been described in nearly every review, I filmed it, gathered friends to gaze at it's splendor...there was no splendor, the unboxing was extremely anticlimactic, but the bed? Jeez Louise, don't look any further buy this one...BUY THIS ONE...FOR REAL.

At this price point. This may be the greatest purchase of my life. Honestly I was expecting a few years out of it. If it lasted 2 years even, I’d still consider it money well spent, but it has been six years and it is going strong. It is a bit on the soft side but this brand makes a ton of different varieties. I like it soft. I have turned several friends onto it and they bought it and they are all as stoked about it as we are. So yes, 6 years later it is going strong with no sign of losing steam.

My first and most important priority was something that would alleviate my lower back problems. I have longstanding back issues and I needed something that would help with the stiffness in my back and hips. My previous spring mattress was a firm but I liked the support. I found some relief on my boyfriend's mattress, but found that his was a tad too plush, that it did not properly support my pressure points and I'd even wake up with numbness sometimes. I would classify his as a medium-plush to medium. His mattress is a hybrid spring, just like this one with the memory foam layer that is much like a topper. I am not too fond of straight memory foam mattresses because I have yet to find one with the proper support and I personally believe that they hold their shape less longer over time than a spring mattress. So as I researched for a hybrid spring mattress with a deep depth, I went through several websites, vendors, and reviews. I came really close to purchasing two other extremely similar mattresses to this one on this same app, and wayfair. What it ultimately boiled down to and what made me decide on this one was the amount of positive reviews it had and the price point. The price combined with the amount of people who are satisfied with this hybrid spring mattress, just can't be beat. I told myself that if I'm going to take a gamble on buying a mattress online and get a horrible mattress, I'd rather beat myself up over losing out on $240 as opposed to $500 or even $1000. So I convinced myself to bet on this one, and hoped that the odds would be in my favor and so far so good!I was a little wary of these new mattresses that come compressed in a box. The box was too heavy for me, someone with back issues, to take up a flight of stairs. There was no chemical smell at all. As soon as we removed the about three layers of packaging, it immediately began to grow! After about an hour, I would say it was 75% there. 24 hours later, I felt that the corners still needed time as the directions state to wait the full 48 hours before putting any weight on the mattress. It was about 90% there, and although my boyfriend insisted we should try it out already, I stood firm and told him no we should wait the full 48 and I'm glad we did! We've slept on it for the past week now on the floor as we wait to purchase a new bed set and it's like a dream. I wake up with no back issues whatsoever, no numbness, nothing! It hugs my hips in a way that is supportive, but not too firm, yet not too plush. Ever since messing up my back, I am not able to lay on my back for an extended period of time. I'm a side sleeper. But I've found that I can even fall asleep on my back with this mattress, and I haven't been able to do that in years! My boyfriend is a big guy, and his side is not uneven or sunken in any way. Now my only concern will be if this mattress will stand up to the test of time because unfortunately I cannot give my word on that yet but I'm very impressed and hopeful so far! If anything changes, I will edit this review. I'll give an update in 6 months to see where we're at with the mattress. If you're looking at this mattress and you've researched for weeks like I did, I say go ahead and take a chance on it, because you won't be able to find such a cheap hybrid spring mattress anywhere else with so many great reviews. If I had to rate the firmness of it, I'd say it is between a medium and firm, a medium-firm if you will (on a scale of plush-medium-firm). I tried to measure it with an old school ruler (as shown in pictures) and I'd say it's a solid 12 inches, probably not 13 but honestly I'm so satisfied with the comfort of the mattress, that the exact depth is the least of my worries.EDIT AFTER OVER A YEAR: We've had this mattress over a year now, and it's still going strong! Hasn't sunken in anywhere and it is still as comfortable as the first day we got it. I wish I knew a long time ago that it was my old mattress that was not allowing me to sleep on my back, when I thought it was just me. I fall asleep like a baby on my back now, and I didn't think that would ever be possible again due to my back issues, but now I see I was just sleeping on the wrong mattress.

Needed another mattress & for some reason could not ship the plush to Hawaii. But the medium mattress could be shipped, so I went with that. If you are reading this then you know mattresses are a very personal choice. How can a mattress feel like sleeping in a cloud & also feel like sleeping on a slab of concrete? Is there truly that much difference in 2 people’s experience? Or is it quality control of the memory foam? At any rate, I had a good experience with Lucid once. And had a bad experience with a different brand where the new mattress had zero support & gave me back pain like I’ve never experienced before. It also was so hot! And if you get the mattress & don’t like it, good luck getting it back into the box & returning it! I ended up selling it to some poor soul that didn’t know what a torture thing the mattress was. But hey, there were a gazillion 5 star reviews on that brand. Maybe the buyer got an almost brand new “like sleeping on a cloud in an inferno” for a fraction of the price!Anyways, back to this medium support Lucid. It’s OK. I wake up with ZERO back pain & does not retain heat, so maybe it does deserve a 5 star instead of 4 star. But, I just wish it had a tad bit more softness. Like maybe one or two more inches of soft memory foam. I’ve had it for a couple months. I am hoping as it breaks in it will soften up a bit. This mattress is probably good for people larger than I. And I sleep alone with a couple little furry friends. I tried putting a 3” memory foam mattress topper on it but it was too much, a little too soft. Maybe a 1” or 2” topper will work. Don’t get me wrong, I really do like this mattress. No back pain is worth a lot!!! This mattress is almost perfect! I would have traded the plush for this medium, but he let the old dog sleep on it with no waterproof protection & guess what? He can keep it! Also, the softer they are the faster they degrade. That plush mattress… the person sleeping on it is about 30-40lbs heavier than me. He’s been sleeping on it for 5 years & its has an indentation where he sleeps. But he has not complained about that. He does complain about the fact that there’s no support at the edges when you sit. That is true for any memory foam mattress. He ended up putting padded side boards on his bed frame to give it support (my bed frame already has side boards, which is perfect for memory foam!) I really wish I could have ordered the plush Lucid, even if I would have to replace it in 5 years. For the price, to me, it’s worth it. That plush mattress was perfect, this medium is almost perfect & since it is firmer, hopefully it will last a little longer. Good luck with the search for the perfect mattress! If you can afford to pay a little more, buy one at Costco or somewhere that you can return it if it doesn’t work for you. Or go to a mattress store & take a lie down on different brands. Or lie down on a friend’s memory foam & see how it feels. There’s just no way to know, since every mattress on Amazon has contradictory reviews. I do believe that if you are not sure, go with the firmer one. If it’s too firm, you can always put a topper on it. But if it’s too soft & causes crippling pain & makes you feel like you are sleeping in an inferno of heat, you are pretty much screwed. I do recommend this medium Lucid mattress.

When we moved in together, we brought her bed with. The mattress kept getting worse and worse so we ended up going to both several chain and local mattress stores. The cheapest we could find for a basic queen size memory foam mattress was $700.We bought this, somewhat hesitant about buying an off brand mattress from Amazon. We left it to inflate for 4 days before sleeping on it and it was so comfy, not too hard and not too soft. Just right! We then put a plastic mattress protector/cover on the mattress to protect it from spills, etc.Shortly after that, we noticed the bed wasn’t very soft or comfy anymore, almost too hard. We thought that the mattress had finally showed it’s true colors and we were a little upset.On a whim, we removed the mattress protector/bag and all of a sudden, the mattress was super comfy again. Lesson learned!So don’t put a mattress protector on the mattress and it will be fine. Just don’t spill anything on it, although the mattress does have a cloth cover that goes over the foam that’s removable.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States June 26, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Couldn\'t be more pleased, and yes I opted for ""Reg"" and yes it was firm enough!', 'author': 'Virgil', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I researched this one very carefully before deciding on it. The issue was weather to get ""firm"" or not, since I wanted a firm mattress.It was a good thing I trusted other reviewers who warned only to get the ""regular"" level of firmness (no additional firmness) or it would be too hard. And they were right. After unboxing (more like unrolling, or actually ""allowing the blob to expand automatically), and placing it on the metal bed frame (also purchased at the same time for the purpose) upon which I had placed an extra-dense piece of heavy duty cardboard (do not use corrugated) to prevent ""oozing"" of the gel and foam construction through the slats of the bed frame, I had to sit on it for firmness. Too soon to tell, as the instructions said to wait a while for it to expand out to full size.They were right that it takes a few days to reach ""full power"" meaning expanded to full size and density. But even after a few hours it was evident that it was probably going to be firm enough.Guess what? After a few days it was confirmed that this thing was super firm, as firm as or even firmer THAN a regular firm mattress. But it is different- wait til you try it. It really is nice. It STAYS put. Or should I say YOU stay put and do not jostle around when you move around on it. I like it a lot. I don\'t think I would ever want a regular mattress ever again.This was for a spare room, and guests love it.

Wanted the overall height of the bed to be lower than our previous 14” Simmons memory foam on foam platform supporting box spring. That was furniture store bought and which was about 10 years old. It had depressed where we each usually sleep. Kept the platform which really didn’t appear to have any sag and added a wood slat support on top of it to preempt it from getting any from the thinner mattress. Let the new mattress breathe after unboxing for four days. Put it in place and attempted sleep for a few nights. Then we talked and found out we were sharing the same pain. Bone joints; shoulders, hips, knees, and elbows, ached for both my spouse and me; hubby 6’3” 188 lbs & wife 5’3” 118. Tried sleeping on back, sides and front.By the 7th of January we bought a 4” combination mattress pad that’s 2” more memory foam and 2” polyester padding. So much for the thinner profile and actually seeing much of our headboard. This made the bed comfortable and our sleeping nightly remained sound until November 2023. By then the sleep spots were getting depressions in the top of the bed which were no longer removed by a wash of the fiber pad and fluffing. Removed the mattress pad combo and replaced with to another pad set that claims 4” but is really 2.5” memory foam and 1” polyester pad and this has rejuvenated full night’s sleep and a flat bed top again.No depressions were noticed in the mattress when making the topper switch. It was so hard I don’t know that we could depress it.Overall thoughts - Really wished we could have done a lay test. Pleased the Lucid mattress has held shape. Sad it was about 40% of the price to make it sleep worthy. Okay with the fact that add got us 3 years of use and it was about that same amount to renew the feeling rather than buying a new mattress.

It was quite old and hard to sleep on, so seeing this was a happy moment.Anyway, this mattress is a mixture of gel, CertiPUR-US certified memory foam, pocket coil springs and OEKO-TEX standard fabric. Plus, it is manufactured without fibreglass in all materials.This mattress has a medium firmness as well as a 12in deep thickness.I previously has a mattress topper that was soft, so I thought a medium mattress would help improve me having those \'sinking feelings\' because it just didn\'t feel firm enough.Plus, I have an arrangement of back pain as well as body aches sometimes, so I definitely needed an improvement.First off after following the instructions, you merely take off your plastic and wait for it to inflate.To be honest, I never had a hybrid mattress before, so I\'m not sure how long the waiting time should be. It\'s recommended to let it inflate up to 72hrs after opening.Though, it blew up within 10mins. It inflated quite fast and didn\'t take anytime for it to level out. Though, I still waited at least 24hrs for it to set just in case.On first impressions, I could see that it was much thicker than my last mattress. It also has at least a quarter of extra height as well. The top layer definitely bulges out more compared to those ""flat mattresses\'.It seems like it has high quality fabrics and it even has built in handles on the side, so you can move it easier. It also has a beautiful neutral coloring, as well as updated design. It\'s very appealing to look at.As for size and overall feel, my sheets had no problem fitting on it. So, you shouldn\'t have to necessarily switch out anything new for your new mattress. So, it\'s decently sized for most sheets.It felt like......a medium. I definitely felt the difference when laying on it compared to my other one. It is a bit firm, but has a more sturdier softness.I sink only slightly, but I am mostly stable when laying or sitting. Does it fix my back pain? Only slightly. The way this bed is designed, it feels better to lay directly on your back or on your front. It doesn\'t really \'contour\' enough for side sleepers.So, I have a much better experience sleeping in other positions with this mattress rather than on my side.It is more breathable as well, doesn\'t get too hot easily and feels most comfortable over longer periods. It is decent for multiples, but it can also be great for singles. It also doesn’t move around too much, so that’s a plus as well.So, all in all, it was very much worth it. It’s durable, strong, has great quality materials, feels as expected, can sleep peacefully without being disturbed, adequate softness, and thick layers.

If you like a firmer mattress, you should like this one. The springs give you that sense of being well supported while the foam gives a little extra cushion so you don't feel like you are sleeping on a rock.This is a typical bed in a box as far as setup goes.

The discomfort had become unbearable, making it a struggle to get out of bed each morning. Opting for a firmer mattress, I chose a hybrid with inner springs instead of a full-spring mattress, aiming for a balance between support and comfort. The well-packed mattress, vacuum-folded in a box with dual layers of plastic wrapping, arrived in excellent condition. Despite the instructions recommending three days for expansion, it reached its full shape within a few hours. Although we adhered to leaving it for an additional two days, there was no further change in size. However, noticeable ""dents"" persisted on two of the pillowtop corners, and despite almost two months of use, they haven\'t resolved.Here\'s my honest review after two months of usage:Pros:Weight: The mattress\'s substantial weight contributes to stability.Firmness: As a hybrid mattress, it provides the necessary firmness, significantly alleviating my back pain and promoting a refreshed wake-up experience.Air Circulation: The ""egg-crate"" design on the pillowtop facilitates better air circulation, preventing heat buildup and ensuring a cooler sleep.Cons:Tilted Pillow Top: One side of the foot end of the mattress exhibits a slight tilt in the pillowtop, noticeable right out of the box. Whether intentional or a defect remains unclear, raising questions about the design.Deeper Bumps: The bumps on the pillowtop are somewhat pronounced, easily felt during sleep and occasionally disrupting my rest. A more seamless design for these bumps would have been preferable.In conclusion, while the hybrid mattress offers stability and the desired firmness, the persisting pillowtop issues and the somewhat disruptive bumps leave room for improvement. Despite these drawbacks, the positive impact on my back pain and the cooler sleep experience make it a worthwhile investment.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 8, 2024', 'is_verified': False}]"

This one has not fully expanded and it has been 2 days. Not only that but when I pull upwards on the mattress to see where the remainder would lift, it literally CANNOT be stretched upto 12 inches in height. This is false advertisement. The mattress is also 1inch short of the 60inches in width that a Queen is supposed to be. You can try to push in on any part of the mattress and with little effort you can feel the springs and even hear them creak and move.

And, I would purchase Dourxi again based on my excellent sleep experience with this mattress.This is also well sewn with quality seams and trim.The casing is soft to touch but my mattress protector and sheets completely encase the beautiful material and trim so I don\'t understand why people talk about that.There was NO odor or ANY chemical smell that released from it at ALL.The box says \'natural and organic\', but I don\'t really know if that is true or not.

So far I’ve noticed that although the edges did firm up just a bit they are still not supportive and you absolutely will slide right off the side. It is not plush in my personal opinion and a little more firm than I expected but hopefully with time and the addition of a pillow topper it will soften.

I am the girl who usually buys the mattresses that are several thousand dollars.So, anyway, I did not know what to expect with this. I didn\'t even get to test it in advance. I just took a gamble and tried it.Well. So, it came in a box that was plenty tall, but way too, well, narrow. My first thought was, what the hell? My second thought was, that can\'t be the mattress, can it? Well, yes, it is.What I learned was that somehow or other, probably using dark magic or something, they deflated it and rolled it up to get it into the box. They also sealed it into plastic.Well, this is extremely convenient for getting the mattress into the room you want. It is a lot easier to maneuver this rolled-up mattress than it is to maneuver a queen-sized mattress.That said, this mattress is extremely heavy. I needed two people to lift it - not because it\'s bulky, which of course it is because it\'s a mattress, but because of the weight. That is definitely an issue for someone who lives alone, or someone who lives in a household where one (or even zero) people cannot manage very heavy things. If you are in this situation, plan to get someone to help you move it, or else it will be decorating your porch or entryway for a while until you figure that bit out.I have no clue why it is so heavy. Other mattresses are not this heavy... at least, I\'ve never had one anywhere near this heavy before. It is baffling.But, anyway. At least it is easier to navigate through doorways than a fully-inflated mattress, because it is rolled up. Make use of that bonus.Once you get the mattress to where you want it to go, you release it from the plastic. They warn you to step back when you do this, and they are not kidding. It was like my mattress suddenly gasped for a breath of air, and its ""lungs"" expanded.That said, they ALSO tell you to wait 72 hours after it begins the inflation process. This, too, they are not kidding about. The mattress continued to inflate, slowly but surely, for at least that amount of time.It is my understanding that you absolutely should not use it, even so much as doing a test-sit, until the mattress is done inflating. It is my understanding that if you do, you can prevent the mattress from fully inflating (ever), and thereby have a less-than-stellar mattress which is awful and lumpy and thin (at least in some spots). Well, I did not test that theory. I closed the door to my room to make sure even the dogs and cats did not sit on it until it was done inflating. I would strongly suggest you do the same, if you want this mattress to be the best it can be in the end.Obviously, that creates a short-term problem. WHERE do you let this mattress inflate? You could put it on your bedframe, but if you do (and it\'s not a new guest bed or some such), then where do you sleep for 3 or 4 nights? You could put it on the floor NEXT to your bed, but that takes up a lot of floor space. And, too, if you have kids or pets, or even if you\'re just clumsy, you run the risk of someone stepping on it while it\'s inflating. So, basically, I think most people will find that it disrupts your household quite a lot for that time period.Well, then, you\'re asking, why do I still give it a good star rating? Well, see, now, that issue is temporary. Yes, it\'s a pretty big, pretty annoying issue. But, once it is finally done inflating, it\'s done. You have your mattress then. Problem over.And, yes, the quality of the mattress once you finally can lie on it is good. Very good.No, it doesn\'t compare to the luxury of a multi-thousand dollar mattress. I would be lying through my teeth if I said it did. The super-expensive mattress is definitely better.But for the price you pay, this mattress is AMAZING. It\'s pretty comfortable. It cradles your body a bit while you sleep.I admit... I haven\'t had it long enough to know if the greatness lasts. But it is pretty great so far.I also will say that you do sort of sink in a bit more than you might be used to with more traditional mattresses. As a side effect, the mattress gives you a bit warmer sleep than a regular mattress. If you are a cold person when you sleep, you will probably find this a bonus. It\'s like an underneath blanket snuggling you, sort of, kind of. But if you sleep hot and find yourself kicking blankets off in the middle of the night, then you will probably find this a minus.I do wonder if that makes this bed somewhat better in winter and somewhat worse in summer. Well, I\'ll find out in time, for sure.It is my understanding that this type of bed is supposed to be a good bed for about 5 years, maybe a bit less. So, if you are seeking a bed that will last 10, 20, 30 years, nope, this is not it. But it is a very affordable option that will get you a really nice bed right now. And if you don\'t need or want that sort of longevity in a mattress, then this might be exactly what you are looking for.I\'m not looking forward to hauling it out when its lifespan is done, on the theory that it will be as heavy then as it was when we moved in it... but that\'s a future problem.Count me a happy customer who is sleeping just fine.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 20, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Comfy and affordable', 'author': 'Cynthia', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I\'ve never tried a hybrid mattress, but I needed a new bed set so I ordered this 12"" queen size mattress.

I opened the sheath first, then unrolled the inner plastic , which contained my mattress. A small opening tool was included, basically a letter opener type thing, and slit open the final packaging. As soon as it got some air, it started to expand. It was very quick and easy, and within a couple minutes it was nearly fully decompressed. I was expecting a stale-air plastic smell and was pleasantly surprised that there was none. After letting the bed ""grow"" for a couple days, I put it to the test. Wow! Very comfortable!

Therefore, I am going to try to give you the facts more so than my personal opinion. First, some background. My wife and I have slept on an expensive Tempurpedic mattress for the past for the past 12 years which we purchased for $3,000 at the time. We purchased this queen mattress for $200 with the coupon that was available at the time of purchase. The tempurpedic has begun to sag and we are considering upgrading to a king so we thought we'd buy a cheaper mattress for now until we decide if we are going to make the upgrade. All of this is to say that our expectations are different than if we were coming off a mattress in the same price range.We received this in a much smaller box than I anticipated. When I first rolled it out while still sealed up, it was barely thicker than a rug. Once I broke the seal and the air came in, it expanded to its full size. We let it rest for 72 hours as recommended.I have spent several nights on this mattress now and can say that it is very supportive. My back had started to hurt on the tempurpedic because of the sag. I weigh 230 lbs so back support is very important to me. This mattress is on the firm side so it is good for back and tummy sleepers. This supports my back very well and my back pain has eased since we got it. I expect it will soften a bit after a few weeks of use, but I am not sure given I have never had a hybrid mattress before.One thing I am not used to yet is the softness of the edge of the mattress when I am sitting on the edge of the bed. It compresses a lot more than my old one which is to be expected. Anywhere other than the edge is pretty evenly firm. I do like the divot pattern in the top cushion because it allows air to circulate. This is helpful on warmer nights.Overall, this is a great mattress for this price range, much better than I expected, honestly. When I compare this to what I have seen and tested out at the local brick and mortar store at the same price point, I think this one is much better."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 25, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Looks fine, haven’t slept on it.', 'author': 'Kyle James', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'I have sat on and laid on the bed and it feels like it is comfortable enough.

I left my window open at night, and 90% of the smell was gone by the next morning.Day 2: At first, the mattress was a bit firm, but after about 24-36 hours the mattress had fully decompressed and was much more comfortable. It\'s probably a 6.5/7 out of 10 on the firmness scale, the way most online professional mattress websites suggest. The top Avena foam layer sleeps cool, so I don\'t overheat. The bounce the Avena foam + the pocketed coils provide makes moving around, and getting out of bed effortless. The off-gassing smell is just about gone now.Day 3: Decided to get rid of my old mattress and keep the Sapira. I sleep mostly on my back, but sometimes on my side and stomach throughout the night. The only sleep position I thought wasn\'t going to work out was the side position, because of the firmness, but the 3 inches of Avena + memory foam actually provide just enough sinkage, while keeping my spine aligned. The off-gassing smell is completely gone now. I bought a mattress protector, and then my bed sheet goes over that to complete the package.When I bought this mattress last Sunday, there were 20 left in stock with Amazon. As of this morning, only 9 Queen-size beds were left in stock, while some sizes other than Queen were already out of stock. So clearly word is getting out about this mattress. At $1,325, it\'s also a lot less expensive than every other hybrid mattress on the market, most of which will cost at least $2,000 more than this one, and will require you going to a showroom, and taking time off work to be home for delivery.In conclusion, I highly recommend this mattress. Please feel free to ask me any direct questions on here. Also, if you have time, I recommend reading the review on Sleepopolis, as it\'s the most comprehensive professional review that matches my own experience.Update: although I bought a Claritin mattress protector, and although when I called Sapira customer service they recommended having one too, I removed it on Day 4. It added a ""plastic"" feel to the surface of the bed that became unbearable. Once I removed it, that initial softness I experienced on Day 1 came back again. I only intend to use just my bedsheet from here on out. I recommend you do the same.((On a side note, I suggest ignoring the only other two reviews on here, both two stars. Unlike myself, neither one is a confirmed buyer of this product. The first review is too short to be real for a legitimate mattress evaluation by an actual customer. The fact that this mattress has the firmness rating it does shows the Sapira is designed for superior back support, so the reviewer\'s complaint is illogical. The second review is also partially off topic, as they discuss the manufacturers\'s website, which has nothing to do with how the mattress feels. Yes, they are correct the mattress is a little firm, but every other online review already confirms this. So to slam the product with only two stars for performing how it was designed is unfair.))', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 2, 2017', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars good quality and definitely med firm', 'author': 'KC', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I've slept on this mattress now for a week and am very pleased with its level of firmness.

Like most reviews about this mattress here, including mine, they are from someone who hasn\'t had this mattress very long, so I will be updating this from time to time. It\'s easy to say it is nice and comfortable when it\'s new, but how does it hold up over time is important to know so updates will be coming to this review from time to time.Pros:Shipping was right on time and it was packaged carefully and received in great condition. We received it on Thursday and put it on the bed and unwrapped it as soon as we got it. There was no odor or chemical smell of any kind right out of the box. We let it expand for more than 48 hours before sleeping on it Saturday, or last night. The mattress is very firm with a plush topper on it. It\'s very firm but not hard. I had the best nights sleep last night that I\'ve had in a very long time last night thanks to this mattress. It is very supportive and comfortable. I am a side sleeper that turns frequently and I found myself turning last night much less than I usually do. We are coming off a twelve year old 10 inch Serta mattress and I am pleased as punch that we went with the 14 inch mattress this time. I\'m really impressed with how tall it is. As a big and tall person, the height makes is real easy to get in and out of.Cons:None yetOther information:I am a big person, 6\'3"" and 330#. My wife is pretty small, about 5\'3"" and 135#. After the first night her opinion is that she was comfortable on it and slept better than she has in a while. It may actually prove to be a bit firm for a smaller person or for someone who doesn\'t care for a firm mattress, , but for me, I am very surprised and happy with how well it supports me. Again, it is very firm but not hard - very supportive. The topper adds just the right amount of plush softness on top where we lie. When either of us move or roll on our side, the other person doesn\'t feel it on their side.Recommendation:If you are a big or tall or heavy person and need a firm mattress, or just someone whole prefers a firm mattress, I recommend this one in the 14 inch height. The 14 inch height is well worth the additional cost over the 10 inch in my opinion. I also recommend for the 14 inch mattress that you let it expand 48 hours before sleeping on it. The website recommends 24 hours, but I can tell you that after the initial 24 hour period, ours expanded another several inches over the second 24 hour period. Give it 48 hours to expand before sleeping on it, you will be glad you did.11-26-2019 UPDATEHave slept on the mattress 10 nights now.

It has been moved home and then back up to another apartment. We were able to fold it in half and hold it with ratchet tie straps in order to transport it in a SUV. It does take at least 2 people and ratchet ties to get it folded top to bottom ends. Surprisingly, folding didn’t negatively affect the mattress. It easily went back to its normal shape.So I bought this mattress for my son\'s bed at his college apartment. I wasn\'t sure what to expect, but I have been pleasantly surprised. He says that it is very comfortable and he sleeps well on it. The mattress pairs nicely with the ZINUS Judy Upholstered Platform Bed Frame / Mattress Foundation / Wood Slat Support / No Box Spring Needed / Easy Assembly, Full (and no box spring needed). I do recommend going with 14"" mattress because I think the thicker the mattress, the more comfortable it is. My only complaint/issue with this mattress is that if you sit on the edge, you are going to slide off because there isn\'t much support along the edges (as you would see with a $1000 coil mattress). But for only costing $250 and arriving condensed in a box that allowed it to be easily put in an SUV and transported up to school, I can\'t complain. We were originally looking at mattresses at C*stc*, but this was about half the price and fit inside the SUV.

That did not seem appealing to me at all. Also, some of the other memory foam products I have used, smelled unpleasant even after letting them air out and treating them with deodorizers. I have tried many memory foam pillows and seat cushions. Fortunately, this is not the case with this mattress. It does not feel like a giant sponge and smell terrible. The cooling effect is only temporary, because your body warms up the mattress gradually as you sleep. I found that rolling over every once and awhile it become cool again if you move some, which I do. If you like soft mattresses that you sink into, this is great. If you like firm mattresses, then this is not so great. Unfortunately, I wish the mattress to be more firm. Don't get me wrong, I have had some of the greatest sleep ever on this mattress. It does a great job of relieving pressure throughout my body, so I can relax, maybe a little to well. The size of the mattress fits perfectly for my bed.

Each corner was dented in and it caused the middle to be much higher than the rest of the bed.2. It advertised this mattress as a 6.5 between firmness and softness. We needed some sort of firmness so that I could breastfeed, yet be soft enough to be comfortable. I haven’t found firmness. After sitting (or applying too much pressure at pressure points of the body) I sink so far in that my MIDDLE BACK feels the mattress. This also makes it extremely hard to breastfeed. When trying to adjust, the baby sinks into the pressure spots (as I apply more pressure than she does due to adult vs child). Even after NUMEROUS pillows, there is just no support, especially since the mattress never evened out.3. The last 2 nights of sleeping on this mattress, I’ve awaken with pain in one of my legs. (I have to sleep on my side to breastfeed and I alternate throughout the night). And the pain hasn’t died down. This mattress was advertised to ease pain, not cause it- but I’m having the opposite effect.Ultimately, we will be trying to return this ASAP.Update!: we decided to keep it a little longer and allow it to shape/form correctly.We placed it on an actual bed support and it was immediately a change for the better. I’m not sure if all the cushion on carpeted floor was the reason, but it was night & day after putting it on a platform bed.Super comfortable, and the movement doesn’t effect everyone sleeping in the bed. Reminds me of that wine commercial mattress. I haven’t done wine, but I’ve done a glass of water and it held place while I got off the bed. It hugs your body without making you feel like you’re sinking into the mattress. Super comfortable & the mattress shaped itself out in a few days after my initial review.No body pains, better sleep, and even my husband doesn’t snore as much or as loud when he does snore. Definitely such a difference from when he falls asleep on the couch watching tv. SO grateful we gave it time & kept it!

I mentioned to the woman at the store how I see these mattress online, and they always have great reviews and are really decent prices. Her response was “yeah, talk to anyone who has actually slept on one and you will see why.”That scared me. Obviously.

We let it rise for about 3 hours before we had to sleep on it. It was totally ok and didn’t ruin its process at all.From night number 1- it’s an amazing mattress.Night 3- best decision.It’s more firm then my last one, but had a really nice cushion to it that cradles your body where it needs it.Being a side sleeper this has cut my hip pains down totally.I was scared to try a firm mattress because of how much chronic pain I am in- I always want to be on a soft cloud.

Shipping packaging: arrived in cardboard box. Inside, mattress is vacuum-compressed within thick, clear plastic. It is rather heavy (70+ lbs) for its boxed size, so have help ready to lift, etc.2. Unboxing: make sure your bed frame is ready, before opening the plastic vacuum wrap! Once the seal is broken, it expands quite rapidly, and is unwieldy.3. Expansion: 3-5 hours minimum is recommended (by manufacturer). We allotted about 7 hours, before we slept on it, and it seemed OK. There was little to no odor.4. Initial sleep: of course, any new mattress requires a bit of “getting used to”. First sensation when laying upon it is one of slight envelopment. Not a negative, just a bit more initial “give”, than we were accustomed to. Support seemed to be in a 6+ range. Welcome lack of pressure points, particularly when side-sleeping. Back-sleeping was extra restful, for me.5. Consecutive sleeps: after a few nights acclimating, our initial comfort assessments are unaltered. It does feel a slightly warmer, than any previous mattress, but this is easily adapted. Rolling over does take considerably more effort, but due to the comfort level, we found ourselves rolling much less often.6. Incidentals: There is little edge support, with this mattress. If you frequently sit on the edge of your bed, you may find this awkward or challenging. As this type is less rigid than a traditional mattress, moving it around (to do periodic rotation, for example) is more laborious – almost a “dead weight” experience.7. Overall impressions: We are pleased. So far, this seems to be a cost-effective, convenient, expedient means to a new, comfortable mattress.

Will prob get mattress topper but still debating bc I do like the bed and I know it’s healthier for me this way. Just takes getting used to if you like soft beds.I think this bed is a little firm for my taste. It does have give and it is very comfortable to sit on. I love the texture of the covering too. I think it’s good quality and safe from fiberglass - that was very important to me. My back and shoulder pain has decreased SIGNIFICANTLY. I think the pain I still have in my neck and shoulders is from other habits and my office chair, stress etc. that’s why I like this bed even though I didn’t find it extremely comfortable at first. It’s definitely wayyyy healthier than other beds. I had family members try it and they said u can tell it’s a good bed because you can lay on it without a pillow. That may be true for a few mins, but for me sleeping on it, I think I need new pillows (maybe tall foam pillows?) in order to be comfortable. I am also probably going to buy a really plush mattress topper and I think this would make it perfect. Anyway point is - it is a good mattress, it’s very healthy for your spine, but for those who prefer actual medium plush, it’s not that. To me it’s medium closer to medium firm. However again I do not regret my purchase at all. Sleeping is not all about being super comfy, it’s about your health, but that mental aspect of super comfy is important to me because I have a lot of mental issues around sleep. However, that just means I need to get accessories for my bed to give me that comfy feeling without sacrificing the health of my back and spine. Overall definitely happy with my purchase :) would recommend. Also for extra context, I am a 26 yo 5’5 180 lb woman who is extremely pear shaped - so I’ve really struggled w lower back pain because it’s really hard for a bed or anything really to equally distribute my weight due to my small waist compared to wide hips etc. so there will usually be a gap below my lower back which has caused chronic pain.

I hope it helps in your search.For about a year, I have been conducting online research on mattresses waiting for the day when we could finally purchase new mattresses. I concluded that Talalay latex would likely be the best since I have a severe case of fibromyalgia. We went to our local mattress store to try one out. The three layer wasn’t soft enough. The four layer was better but not “it.” However, anything was a vast improvement on our now 16 year old mattress with its his and her respective ditches. I planned to buy online, but out of curiosity I asked the clerk how much it cost. Good thing we both were lying down at the time. Over $3500! Online prices started around $1500, much better but still a crazy price to me as I would need to add a foundation, sheets, etc. and do that times two since my husband and I sleep in separate bedrooms out of physical necessity. I figured we needed to save at least $4,000 for both of us to get new mattresses, which I could not wrap my head, nor my budget around.Six months later, my body was screaming for a new mattress. One day, we stopped at a different mattress shop to try out a memory foam mattress. I preferred the feel of the memory foam to the latex. Again, I asked how much. Again, we were glad we were lying down. They were having a sale: Queen size reduced from $1800 to $1299. I calculated about $3000++ for both of us to get fully situated, which was still a crazy price. I returned home and started round two of research.I searched “mattress” and “fibromyalgia” to help narrow my search. I went to Amazon and found Lucid and reviewed all of their mattresses. I watched a YouTube video about the 14 inch gel foam memory mattress by Goodbeds.com (I also watched Goodbeds video reviews of competitors) and felt that the Lucid 14 inch gel memory foam was the standard by which to compare all others. I took Goodbeds test to help narrow down likely best mattresses for me, which included questions about health issues and specifically fibromyalgia. They generated a list of mattresses that would support a side sleeper with fibromyalgia. The Lucid 14 inch gel memory foam was one of their top recommendations for me.In the Goodbeds video, they described the top 5 inches of foam as “premium comfort materials.” And they gave the density for each layer.Layer 1: 5.3 lbLayer 2: 3 lbLayer 3: 1.6 lbFurther research about density confirmed Goodbeds statement of “premium comfort materials.Out of curiosity I researched the competitor’s foam densities.T&N. Layer 1: 2.8. Layer 2: 1.8Dream Foam: Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 2.5, Layer 3: 1.8Novabed, Casper, Nectar, Loom & Leaf, Ghost, etc. None came close to the density levels of the Lucid. None came close in price with prices starting at $800.Determining that quality and price couldn’t be beat, I ordered my Queen Lucid 14 inch gel memory foam mattress for under $500.As stated before I have a severe case of fibromyalgia, which means I am in pain 24/7. As stated before, the old mattress was greatly increasing my pain levels. I was waking up every 2-3 hours in pain. My hips and shoulders hurt greatly as I am a side sleeper. In the mornings, I was so stiff, that I needed to walk for at least 15-20 minutes to loosen up and to reduce the resultant pain spike. I was so tired by the end of my work day that I would be in bed by 6:00 or 7:00 pm. Needless to say, I was beyond excited to be getting a new mattress.However, my two main concerns were 1) firmness since there were a number of reviews who felt this particular mattress was firm m, and 2) off gassing as I am very sensitive to smells. Therefore, we bought my mattress first because if it was too firm or to smelly, my husband would take it as he doesn’t have issues with firmness or smells.The delivery day arrived. Like others have noted, the box it was in had has a hard cross country trip. It was a bit banged up, and the tape on the top had been fully slit. However, the mattress was still in the box and fully protected by the heavy duty plastic. The tool to cut it free was very useful. It was a bit cumbersome, but nothing two people couldn’t manage. Thankfully, my mattress had practically zero smell. My husband had to put his nose on the mattress to smell the off gassing. I just got the smallest of whiffs of off-gassing. It did not bother me at all and fully went away in a few hours. Finally, the mattress plumped up to 14 inches in 4 hours not the 24 hours some reviewers had experienced.Now the real test was to take place - Fibromyalgia vs Lucid! The winner? Lucid!!!My aching body feels like it has found a friend that fully understands how it feels and who wants to make it feel better. The mattress has the perfect balance of plush and support. Pain is not waking me up every 2 hours. My hips and shoulders do not ache. But most amazing of all is that when I get out of bed to start my day, I am not stiff AT. ALL.! I do not need to walk 15-20 minutes to loosen up. I figured the the overall stiffness was 100% fibromyalgia, but it wasn’t. In short, I am sleeping. I am also noticing that because I am better rested certain situations do not wipe me out like they used to. Finally, the memory foam keeps me at the right temperature. On my old mattress, I had to use a heated mattress pad because I was always cold, which increased my pain levels.The Lucid wins on so many levels: supportive comfort for a painful chronic illness, quality of materials, and price.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 8, 2018', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great for the price', 'author': 'Rachel McGrath', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""6/8/18Bought this mattress at the end of May. Like many other reviews have said, the box came pretty beat up. It seems the box is too small for the mattress. After cutting the mattress and letting it expand, it did have a smell to it like other reviews have also said. It reminds me of wet paint, everyone's favorite smell. This is my first memory foam mattress, but I tried others out in an actual store, and this mattress is pretty comparable to more expensive mattresses. It's pretty comfortable, I feel like it is a little firm but my fiancee thinks it is pretty soft. It isn't firm enough to complain about by any stretch. It is also important to note I am a pretty small guy, about 5 foot 7 and 140 pounds and my fiancee is also pretty small. I'm a combo sleeper and I'll start out on my back, go to stomach, then side and it is comfortable in all of those positions. It also transfers movement less than a regular spring mattress. It also sleeps pretty cool. The summer has been pretty hot so far and I haven't woke up sweaty or anything. I'll update the review as time goes on.EDIT 7/15/18The bed is still going strong as far as I know. Nothing has really changed with it, which is good since it has been only a month. Not sure if I wrote this above, but the smell took around a couple of weeks to go away, but I didn't grow an extra arm which is good. It's been really hot here in Maryland and the bed hasn't been all that hot, I haven't noticed it anyway. We've been sleeping really well. No negatives as of yet. My fiancee said she does wish she would sink more into it, but the mattress supports all the heavy stuff like your hips and shoulders well.EDIT 5/3/2020This mattress is heavy. Lordy lord this mattress is heavy. It is thicccccccccc too. I have since moved a handful of times, and the process of moving this mattress sucks. I moved it alone once, and the second time had the help of a friend. Moving it with two people isn't horrible (I weight 150lbs and my friend is also small). My rabbit has peed on it, chewed some of the bottom, and enjoys digging into it. I still have not had any problems with it approaching 2 years of use. I sleep in the same spot and haven't noticed sagging (again I am relatively small). I haven't had any heat issues and I'm a cold sleeper. I am always comfortable. The only complain I have is how big it is. If you aren't moving though, that won't be a problem. I love the mattress and if I had to buy another mattress I would buy Lucid again, just maybe a thinner mattress."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States June 9, 2018', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Nice bed for a great price!!', 'author': 'Tabatha', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'This bed is firm. I read some reviews saying it was as hard as a rock and I\'m confused to what rocks they are holding but it is firm. It is not hard by any means. I\'ve slept on some hard spring beds and this is nothing like that what so ever. I\'ve slept on pillow tops harder. It\'s a great supportive soft bed. It reminds me of a marshmallow. Firm yet squishy. I slept on my mattress last night and I didn\'t wake up once to roll over and the noise is gone from the old spring mattress.The bed is thick. I wish the the cashmere cover on it wasn\'t as loose but oh well. It doesn\'t slide but it isn\'t as tight as I wish it was but it\'s not been the complete 48 hours either since. It has been 24 and I really don\'t think it will be expanding anymore but if it does I\'ll add to this review. I am doubting it will.The smell it has airs out quickly. It\'s winter here and 24 hours later there is only a hint of a memory foam smell. It\'s the same smell my pillow had when I bought it. Nothing to crazy but if you\'re not expecting it it could worry you. It\'s fine though. It is no worse than craft glue or paint. Only these fumes can\'t hurt you.The only reason I don\'t 5 star this bed is because it\'s not quite as high as I thought it would be. I measured my bed frame and how high my mattress needed to be and it isn\'t quite as high as expected but it is foam and that happens. nothing a topper or a bigger pillow can\'t fix. The smell was a bit to be desired for and the fact that you smell like it if you sleep on it. If you plan to buy this mattress don\'t plan to sleep on it the first night. One, it might not be done expanding. Mine took several hours it says in the book it may take 48 hours. Two, the odor coming from the bed it very over whelming at first and you will smell like it if you lay all over it. It isn\'t fumes it\'s just the smell of the foam. It can\'t hurt you but no one likes a bad smell at their house.Other than that the bed is well worth the 400.00 + they ask for it. I would have paid more. I am actually shocked at the price for the quality and now I\'m interested in how long it will last. I plan to add to my post when it needs to be replaced or if it begins to wear down.The bed is amazing though, not hard. Not too soft but as I said a firm soft mattress. It\'s not like sleeping on feathers. Like I said it\'s like sleeping on a jumbo marshmallow. That\'s the only description I can give. Unless you want to call it baby bears bed, not to hard not to soft.I did read some reviews about the top not being 100% cashmere and I have to say ""duh"" cashmere is expensive and you shouldn\'t expect a entire mattress to be wrapped in it for 400.00. You can\'t get a scarf that is made of 100% cashmere for less than 150.00 unless its on sale. This is a HUGE mattress. It is soft. It probably has cotton in it I\'m not sure but it is soft. I do think they expect you to put sheets on the bed though. So why the mattress cover matters is beyond me. I also read a review about the bed not being made of 100% memory foam. If you look at the picture and read the arrows it clearly tells you how much memory foam to expect and how much support foam ect. I am not sure I could sleep on a bed that is 100% memory foam. I think it would be hard to get out of seeing how you melt into it.The packaging was beat up a bit. But my package only had a few holes from being thrown around in the truck. The mattress is wrapped very tightly with 2 players of tape and plastic so it doesn\'t really matter but don\'t expect this to be perfect boxing. It is a bit heavy to lift. My eleven year old daughter and I together brought it in off my deck porch. My husband got it up the stairs him self. I would suggest you unroll the bed on your box spring or plat form bed. Between the weight and the smell unrolling it and them moving it is a bit much. That\'s just my suggestion to others though.All in all great product! I\'m very pleased! I can\'t wait to sleep in it again tonight! Thanks LUCID for the deal and a great bed!UPDATES-It\'s been a little over 2 years or so and I just recommended this bed to a friend. I\'ve had no issues with this bed. This bed was moved and got smashed down our tight stair well. It has been jumped on by kids, smashed, moved, flipped and still the same as when we bought it.The only issue is the memory foam on top ripped. I expected that with the price and plan to add just another piece over top of it. It\'s not really noticeable while sleeping but it\'s a crack.Still a great bed & I would buy another!It is now 2017.

We wanted something more firm, but for a while we thought this was going to be too firm. At first, it truly is like lying on a very flat surface (floor even). There is a lil room for ""sinking in"" but not a whole heck of alot. After sleeping on it for the last couple months that has become better. We did not have any serious issues with getting the bed out of the box and plastic wrap. Once I convinced the UPS to move it from the side door to the front door (the box weighs close to 100 lbs), my husband and I was able to easily get it in the bedroom and out the box. Cutting the plastic was very simple also. It does ""inflate"" fairly quickly, so I would suggest you having it on the bed when you cut the plastic open and be prepared to get it in place quickly. We used out old boxspring from the prvious bed and had no issues. The mattress is heavy and awkward to try and move after, as there are no handles so be prepared and have things in place. Easy to tell top from bottom from the cover on the mattress, which is nice to touch. It is however a lil big for the mattress. While others may not like that, I do because it will be easier to get off and on as we try to take it off and wash it. We did not have any problems with size. The mattress expanded to the 14"" promised maybe even a half inch or so more. I was very happy about this, as we purchased this specific on so we would have the height. Our mattress was not over sized like some of the reviews were stating, maybe even a lil smaller. It measured 59 1/2 X 79 1/2 so a great queen size. Our original boxspring was a lil smaller than the mattress so it does hang over the edges of that all four ways, but creates no issues for us at all and when you make the bed this cover very well. You will certainly need a deep pocket sheet that will fit the mattress being 14 1/2 inches. I had two sets already as our old bed was this deep and was prepared for the height. If you are looking to be lower to the floor, you will not like this bed, unless you are not putting it on a traditional bed/boxspring. The mattress allows my husband and I to sleep through the night feeling VERY little movement from the other should one get up for the bathroom or water or any other reason. It is very easy to sleep through any of that. My husband does not notice any difference in the temperature of the mattress compared to our old one. I do however notice it gets a lil warmer under me the further into the morning I sleep. I know that sounds weird, but it is true for whatever reason. Overall, we are VERY happy with our purchase and see it as money well spent during a time when these mattresses can be so expensinve, it is hard to buy online without trying on out. We did a lot of research, and feel like we may a lucky choice from the 1000\'s of mattresses out there. I would say, we prefer a fluffier pillow with this mattress, though a nice firm one it had to be overfilled, as the bed is so flat so a traditional pillow does not provide enough support, nor did any of the foam pillows we tried. Good luck, and I hope this helps anyone considering this bed.

Was initially skeptical as any buy should be when ordering an object that is used for everyday comfort and health...The bed arrived with minor scuffs on the cardboard but nothing that penetrated the plastic surrounding the mattress itself. It was pretty heavy - so much that the FedEx guy asked me to help him carry it to the door (he did offer to carry it into the bedroom but I figured he's busy enough).Once again, it's pretty heavy even when it's rolled up like an over sized cake roll - you probably want some help to get it setup for maximum ease or have a practical knowledge of physics.I tossed it on the box spring that used to hold our spring style mattress, opened up the plastic on one side, and slid the plastic off the other end without any problems. It immediately began decompressing. After approximately 5 hours it was almost pretty huge and my wife and I gave it a test run. I thought it was great! Our other mattress was a thick pillow-top that had suffered from having a valley in its center from extensive use. This mattress provided enough support to take pressure off of my back yet it was soft enough to feel well-cushioned.Oh, the smell. It's only been airing out for approximately five hours now but I hardly notice it - the wife says it smells like a chemical womb... we'll probably be sleeping in the guest bed tonight just so it can have more time to air out. The card that comes with the mattress states that you're supposed to give it 48 hours to expand and air out which seems reasonable.I'll give it an update after we had a night's sleep on it but I almost fell asleep on it during the test run...so far - great! I don't believe you can find a mattress for this price unless it fell off a truck and a hobo was selling it for booze.**Update 5/29/2012Slept a full night on this bed two nights in a row. If you've purchased this bed and find that it's too firm, try removing any fitted sheets or top sheets that you may have usually slept with and just sleep directly on the mattress cover. The cover itself is very comfortable and appears to help the mattress form better to your body. The fitted sheets I had for our previous mattress were pretty snug when I attempted to utilize them on this mattress and caused the mattress to not conform to your body as well.We both slept great the past two nights! Before the troubles with our current mattress, I generally only slept 5-6 hours a night and felt well-rested. When the troubles slowly began, I was increasingly sleeping 8-10 hours (of broken sleep) and still feeling groggy in the morning. That's pretty much gone now - slept a very good 6 hours of unbroken sleep and woke up refreshed and invigorated. So much so that I had to write this review almost immediately after taking the garbage and recycling out to the curb ;)Would highly recommend so long as you give the mattress its recommended 48 hours to expand and 'fumigate' in a well ventilated room.**Update 02/21/2013Still loving it. The quality of the mattress hasn't diminished at all. Doesn't cause pressure pain on any part of the body. No noticeable sag. The mattress cover is still soft and enjoyable to sleep directly on. My wife finds it to be more firm than she'd like but when she spends a night on the older fancy soft spring mattress, she comes back to this one because her hips hurt from sleeping on springs -- I have my share of upper back problems and the LUCID mattress helps to not further aggravate them."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 24, 2012', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Best sleep ever!', 'author': 'greg', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""This bed is so comfortable I overslept the first 3 mornings I had it.

After settling for the afternoon it was harder and after a day was what I would call firm. It has remained that way for the two weeks I have had it. I would NOT call this a plush mattress. The foam does not allow my hips to sink in and straighten my spine, and my back is sore. I am not sure if this is a quality issue, a symptom of the latex like top layer, or this is how the manufacturer designed the mattress.The edges are easier to get in/out of bed than usual soft memory foam.

Not great considering this thing weighs 100 lbs.I bought a memory foam RV mattress a few years ago from Travel Happy via Amazon and it was soft as described and no quality issues.

This is an issue with this specific brand and mattress design.The delivery options have changed and they don't offer the same service level with haul away now.Very disappointing. I had such high hopes. I will start shopping for another mattress that is (actually) soft.ORIGINAL REVIEW:MATTRESS: See pictures. Quality issues with the cover. Left side is smaller/tighter than the right side. Foam expanded immediately to full height, but tight left side of cover is restricting foam expansion all the way. Mattress is very plush, as described. Maybe too plush. I did want a plush mattress though! [**See two-week update above - firmed up later]DELIVERY & INSTALL SERVICE: Amazon box truck arrived. Installers informed us that we need to remove and haul away our own mattress. They said they “never take away the old mattress.” The bed frame was required to be empty and ready for an install. They would not wait. Since we expected they would remove it, our old mattress was still on the bed frame. SO…they left the mattress at outside our front door. A 100lb box for my husband and I to handle!VERY DISAPPOINTING when the service I selected during order clearly said removal of old, install new, and haul away of old (with limited old haul away exclusions).Interesting when I look now they only offer delivery and unpack. They changed the service after I ordered it. Talk about bait and switch!HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE! And so I have to live with the mattress cover issue?

The box is huge! It was very heavy even for my hunky husband. The box was very damaged obviously. With something this large and heavy, it can\'t be avoided at all. However, it was obvious the mattress was well wrapped and just fine upon arrival. It was marked KING and LUCID all over the box and was obvious that it was the correct item. It had been raining here for the past week nonstop and I was worried if I wasn\'t home when it arrived that it would get soaked. However it was wrapped sooo well in plastic, I know I wouldn\'t have had anything to worry about. The UPS man heaved it into my garage for me on a dolly. It arrived in the morning around 1030 am (and it wasn\'t raining at that time). DH took the mattress box all the way to the bedroom, it was easier to do that than take the mattress out. It had two nylon straps he was able to grab to pull it. He put the mattress roll on the bed and popped the plastic it began to expand quickly. You could smell the ""new paint"" smell but it definitely was not overwhelming by any means. We had readied the windows and fan, but it wasn\'t necessary. The plastic wrap held the paint smell in so I know that it was sealed well. To me it just smelled new and after about a half hour you had to put your nose on the mattress to smell that ""paint"" smell at all. It was expanded almost to 14 inches tonight around 10 pm. The last few inches are taking the longest. But right away the mattress was expanded to about 8 to 10 inches (with in about 5 to 10 mins). It expands at different rates so one side of the bed was higher than the other at first, but it\'s evened out just fine. We had the mattress turned wrong as in upside down, as you want the plain cashmere side to be down, and the fancy stitched side that says, ""cashmere"" and ""Lucid"" stitched all over it upwards to the ceiling. ALSO, we had the foot and head sideways on the bed too, so it had to be turned one more direction to sit right on the bed. But you can figure all that out pretty quickly...lol Do it before it expands too much, it\'s much easier obviously. I put sheets on it and am sleeping on it tonight as I have no choice really, but I think in the morning it should be close to 14 inches. I have pictures and hopefully the video which you will be able to see. I do believe if you want to seriously consider memory foam this is a good way to go, I dont know about it\'s longevity yet. But the foam base it the largest out there- I looked at every single memory foam mattress that is being manufactured and that\'s not a joke. You need a big dense foam base for these beds. Also if you want to go the Tempurpedic route as far as denisty 5 lb density or 7 pound density, this is comparible. We laid on the Tempurpedic beds in the store and compared their composition to this bed. I might get a 6 lb 2 inch memory foam topper for it as I prefer it to be really firm. The Allura is 7 lbs and 5 lbs memory foam, the closest topper I could find was 6 pounds. It costs about $500 too. So even with this mattress and that mattress topper, I am still WAAAAAY under the cost of the Allura Tempurpedic which is almost $5000! We also tried all the other major name brands of memory foam. The other companies like Serta, or Sleep Innovations really don\'t compare. Their densities are much lower and the bases much shorter and in my opinion too small. I even looked at Bed in a Box (although a good company), their beds don\'t boast a higher density foam, and dont\' have a deeper base, I believe they use 3 pounds or less for their memory foam. The Dynasty mattresses are a better buy here on Amazon if you are considering one of those. Just look at how the mattress is made and see for yourself. I called Dynasty and spoke to a very nice man and he answered all my questions as well. They go 1.5"" on their 20 year warranty. Most companies I found don\'t list the density of their foam bases, so that\'s the only unknown. I couldn\'t even find that with Tempurpedic\'s mattresses. I think minimum for two regular sized adults (my husband 6 foot and 210) and I am 5\'6 and pregnant (no need to go there) that 12 inches minimum is what you need. Anything else would not be adequate from what I read. I have been through 2 mattress on warranties in 4 years- from a different company and store (NOT THIS MATTRESS), so I am super paranoid. We aren\'t even trying to go warranty this last mattress as we don\'t even want to deal with it. The first time we did the warranty process was easy and we had it done with in a week, but it\'s just the trouble of hauling it around and taking pictures and being pregnant, I just dont have the energy. I just want a good nights sleep ;) So basically if you want a good memory foam, compare heights, densities and bases. Go from there. I am crossing my fingers that this thing will hold up through the years. I will try to update and answer questions if I remember. I really appreciated the folks who already wrote detailed reviews and one guy even put up a video on another LUCID I think. Oh and the warranty card was stuck right there to the mattress. It states the typical 1.5"" sag, but there are no other stipulations about the 20 year warranty. Bed in a box is 1.25"" and Tempurpedic is .75"". So although they have LinenSpa beat there I still went with this mattress. I even called LinenSpa during regular business hours and someone answered the phone and answered my questions. Be back soon with more info. I really do hope this helps someone else out, even if you don\'t buy this brand, at least maybe it will educate you a little.

If you’re on the lighter side, this might not be the same for you, but again, just speaking for my own size.The quilted top doesn’t have large divots like some mattresses, and the top layer of foam is just thick enough to feel plush without the marshmallow/quicksand feel of the Zinus memory foam mattresses. Great edge support too - sleeping on my side it felt stable right up to the edge.

At this point, I am literally sleeping in a hole in the middle of the mattress and it continues to rapidly deteriorate. In just the past couple weeks, I went to no longer using a pillow because I sink so far down inside the mattress, I just use the edge of the hole I am sleeping in as a ""pillow."" To turn over in the night, I have to do a pushup to push myself out of the hole to turn over. Hard to imagine, but this Zinus mattress is worse than sleeping on the floor.I wondered if there is a warranty for this portable sinkhole, so I called Zinus. The first several times, it really appeared they simply refuse to take calls by using an AI phone tree that denies all calls. But after calling multiple times, I realized it\'s just a terrible quality system (could this be a pattern?) Pro tip: the phone tree asks if you purchased from Amazon- if you say yes, they immediately hang up on you. I call back and said I just want to talk about mattresses, and the robot says ""Sorry, I can\'t help you with that"" and again immediately hung up, etc. So, after saying, ""Buy a mattress"" repeatedly, I finally reached a person to inquire about the warranty:The Bottom Line: The decision to issue a replacement mattress will be made by sending Zinus a picture of the mattress taken with no sheet or object on the bed. If an observable 1.5 inch sag can be noted, then they will issue a replacement, which takes a week. (Note: They pointedly have no interest in my actual experience with the bed, and or any pictures of me actually in the quicksand mattress of death.) However, Zinus has no pickup service for the old mattress, so the responsibility to dispose of the giant CalKing- sized piece of used bubble gum is mine. So, while the prospect of getting a replacement terrible-quality mattress from Zinus and the joy of watching their delivery workers simply walk away from my current La Brea Tar Pit-style mattress because ""they don\'t do that"" is tempting...In closing, I shared my unique view with Zinus customer service that if a company saddles a customer with a (unwieldy, impossible to carry) lemon, they should recognize the significant imposition on that customer and take steps to make it right. Zinus thanked me for this new, deep insight that I provided to them and promised that they would consider it, so that perhaps in the future some other person who absolutely wastes their money on a Zinus product will no longer be burdened with how to dispose of said item.

So I'm one of those people that absolutely suck at buying big purchases like new mattresses when they're clearly needed. I tend to just sleep on the old original, make due, suffer, and complain about it every waking hour..I want to first admit. I did get a discount on this one. Not sure how, just put it in my cart and it was cheaper than what the list price was. Might have been a credit from Amazon I wasn't aware of at the time..So I bought it anyways.First the packaging is awesome. Came in a really small box vacuum sealed with 2 layers of plastic.Remove from box, remove first plastic. 'roll it out', remove second plastic, and watch it expand right before your eyes..It DOES take about 24hrs for it to fully expand. Do not be discouraged. The middle portion expands fast, but the ends (head and foot) do take a little extra time but it's not a big deal honestly.. Give it time!First I sat on it, and it was amazing! Firm, but plush against me, supported but didn't push back so much I was uncomfortable. Then I laid on it. Super firm for the first couple seconds, but once your body sinks into it it really does add great support, but cradles at the same time..It's firm for support, but plush enough to still cradle you like a softy.. Best of both worlds.First sleep.. Now. I've had chronic sleep problems, and severe pain for years, and I really believe it was due to bad sleep on an older spring mattress that's seen better days.. I'd toss, turn, wake up over and over. and though I was laying down for 8-10hrs. I was probably only actually asleep for 2 of those nightly. Life sucked! (although I'm sure the chiropractor enjoyed all the visits)First sleep on this mattress. I slept through the night, turned over once and woke up fine. Sat up. did my morning twist and turn, snappity, crackity, pop. stretched out and actually felt muscles stretching and not just bone/joints grinding.. After about a week. (because there's no miracle pill) I lost 90% of my chronic pain. Because I'm sleeping through the night, not tossing and turning constantly, and the mattress is supporting me no matter my angle.I would 100% recommend this, and other products by this company..

Unlike most people that have written reviews on this, I bought it to be my bed, not for a guest room or bunk-bed, etc.. I was looking for something that didn\'t take up much room (currently renting one room in a house) and could be rolled up or stood up during the day to provide more space. I needed it firm but not stiff (60+ male, 200 lbs with a few chronic med issues), since it would be laying on a piece of carpet on a wood floor (no frame). It has more than met my expectations so far. I can\'t wait to go back to bed later :-).It came vacuum-sealed and rolled up, encased in a thicker (4-5 mil?), ""tube"" of plastic inside a good-quality, thick cardboard box. Carefully cut the thicker plastic (too tight to slip off) tube off (use scissors if you want to be sure not to slip and cut into the mattress) with a box cutter and cut off the plastic ""bag"". No big release of chemical vapors like others I\'ve dealt with in the past. I was very surprised how low (almost non-existent) the odor was. Had to get really close to the mattress to notice it. It expanded pretty fast to the full 5"" and I let it lay on the living room floor overnight and into the next day to air out (instructions say it can take up to 48 hours to fully expand but mine took less than an hour).Next day I replaced my bed-roll (2"" mattress topper with a couple pads for easy roll-up and stashing out of the way) with this mattress and tested it out. Super comfortable for me. It is firm (some would say very firm) but for me it has just enough give and provides great support). For a lighter person, it may be too firm depending on your taste. It\'s too thick to roll up like my make-shift bed roll but it will stand up in an area out of the way. I\'ll take that trade-off of a better sleep vs a bit more room any day.For those who want a softer feel, get a mattress topper for $20-$35. A topper of 1"" - 3"" will provide the softness and ""give"" that many like. It can then be removed for those who like a firm to very firm feel like I do. In any case, I was just going to lay on it for a while to read and check comfort level but ended up falling asleep before I had even put the sheets on. Got a great nap. Hadn\'t slept that well in months. Can\'t wait to try a full night of testing tonight :-))). Your mileage may vary.

I know most of you reading this will be just like I was when I was shopping for a new mattress, to sum it up into one word, nervous. This is a big purchase, and one that is difficult to undo should things not work out. I have issues with low back pain on firmer mattresses, but I also don't do too well on ultra plush mattresses either, so it is a fine line of what will work for me. I also deal with shoulder pain on both sides when side sleeping. I'm a physically fit guy, 6'0, 155 pounds, but I've been in a lot of tumbles in my three and half decades, and consequently I have some pain that typically only develops after several hours sleep on a mattress that is not ideal.I am relieve to report that so far, this mattress has performed beautifully. It came quickly and safely, was very easy to unpack, and very quickly took full form. As soon as I laid on it for the first time I knew this was going to be a game changer, instant comfort, softness and a plush that is just right, not too plush, but more importantly, definitely not too firm! I've had the mattress for about two months now and I have absolutely gotten better rest every single night in the past two months then I was getting on my old mattress.At this point I have to say this mattress is not only excellent quality, but an equally excellent price for what you're getting. I would have imagined having to spend twice or even three times this much for a mattress with this level of comfort, unless it unexpectedly begins to decay or lose its form, comfort or otherwise, though I do not expect that to happen.If I remember I will will post another review in six months to see where its at and hopefully help others to make an informed purchase, but at this point, I'm very pleased with my decision to purchase this mattress."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States November 14, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Not what I excepted', 'author': 'Dawn', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'My old bed was so bad I was sleeping on the couch.I had gone to numerous mattress stores trying to find something reasonable. As with the present economy spending a lot on anything is not on my wish list. While at one store I laid on a bed and said this isn\'t bad but just a little soft for me. He explained it was a bed in the box. When I looked the reviews up on that one they were similar to what I felt when I was on it.So I continued to search. After reading the reviews I thought well its 1/4 of the price of the other ones I have seen and liked. Its incredible to me they can put this in a box. There is no way ever it will go back in one without a device to suck the air out and some work.According to the manufacture you have to let it decompress for the full effect of about 3-7 days. However, you can sleep on it before hand and doing so will not effect the decompressing.So night one I laid on it and it felt extremely springy and I was like ""oh no this isn\'t going to be good"". Plus it was very soft. It sank when you got on it. Second night wasn\'t to bad but not great. It didn\'t sink as low as the first night. However, I slept through the night. I also found it to be a bit hard more firm than med /firm, by the third night.I had a mattress topper from my old bed that is still in like new condition. I threw it on top and the next night it wasn\'t much better. Now I\'m on the fourth night with it and I have to say its comfortable. I\'m keeping my topper on it and if I take it off its to firm for me. Its firm more than medium. Plus it doesn\'t sink at all now. Nor do I feel the springs, nearly as much as the first night but I can still feel them.Side note: The center is softer to sleep on than the sides. So that is a little odd to me. Its not consistent around the mattress and this is night 6. I have a king size bed and have normally always slept one side or the other but right now its strictly the middle.Firm in todays standards is more like sleeping on a board. 20 years ago firm is more like a medium in todays time. Will the mattress last ten years? I don\'t know about that but for the moment it will work for me.Now it is two weeks in to sleeping on this and I don\'t wake up in the night nor do I toss and turn all night but I wake each morning with the middle of my back slightly sore. I\'m not sure if this will be good for the long term but for the moment its working. Would I buy it again? yesWould I recommend it? probably so. Size and weight do matter in mattress shopping. Would I buy it for my son? No because he has a 6k bed and would know the difference.EDIT: It\'s now been several months since I bought this. It\'s completely decompressed, and I love it. Legit its so comfortable I actually want to go to bed. I have left my topper on it and its perfect for me. If you like a firmer mattress, you don\'t need the topper, but my topper makes it kind of like a pillow top. I sleep like a baby. I also live in FL on the beach and even in the worse of the storms we have gotten this season I slept through every one of them.

We chose this one for our everyday bed, and I'm glad we did. Right out of the box it started to expand. Be aware though, and follow instructions so that you don't get hurt!!! It comes out fast once you use the provided tool to open it up. It says to give it like 3 days to fully expand, we only gave it 2, and it was perfect. The only thing, I wish I would have went with the thicker one. We were replacing an old mattress and it was a tad thicker with a pillowtop, so when we put this on top of our box springs, it sat a little lower and that took some adjusting. But it fit perfectly on the box springs, our queen mattress cover and sheets fit it very well, and the overall of it was great. It didn't smell either. I think I read somewhere that out of the box it had a strange smell, ours did not. Actually, no smell at all.Now, let's talk comfort. It is very soft. It does sleep well, but I have issues with my hip (and of course I'm a side sleeper) and sometimes if I sleep too long on one side, my hip will ache. Not a big issue, because my hip hurt with the old mattress too, but that old mattress was 20 years old! LOL. I feel like this one should be more cooling, as well.

It\'s not terrible, and is better then what I have used recently, but it may go back. And yes, it sleeps hot.I have been somewhat on a mattress sojourn the last 2 years after a decade old tempurpedic became too uncomfortable. The first 8-9 years with the Tempur were good, but I sleep hot, and vowed to move to something that had more air flow/didn\'t trap heat. I started with a bed in a box mattress that was great the first 30 days, painful the next 30 days, and returned shortly after. After that, I bought a cheap Ikea mattress after spending an afternoon at the store trying every one they had. I thought I had hit a home run - it was cheap, the one in the store was super comfortable, and it was a spring mattress so it would be cool. 90 days later my back was sore, my sleep was terrible, and I wanted to burn it.I had happend to travel for work, and stayed in a hotel where I got three nights of amazing sleep. I called the hotel and asked what mattress set up they had - and bought the retail version of it. But apparently something got lost in translation between the hotel version and the home version or my body rejected it after 90 days, but it too ended up being uncomfortable.So I finally gave up and decided I would get another memory foam mattress and deal with the sleeping hot with either highly breathable sheets/blankets or a fan. I did some research and after reading a gazillion reviews on the myriad of memory foam beds out there, I went relatively cheap based on the good reviews on Amazon for this mattress. My general thought was - it sounds as good as any of the others and is cheaper, and it\'s through Amazon.And.... it\'s OK.The big issue, in my opinion, is Amazon doesn\'t say what the foam density is. It says it\'s a medium firmness mattress which is highly subjective. As I understand it, there are different densities for memory foam. For instance, a soft memory foam can support 2.5 lbs per square inch, a firmer one 5 lbs per square Inch. I would guess this one is on the softer side because rather than cradle you like the old Tempur did, I kind of sink through and end up on the very firm support layers. If you have a softer memory foam, you probably need more than 2"" of it. Denser ones probably work fine at 2"".What this means for sleep - sleep is just OK on this mattress, not great. Some days I wake up with similar back pain as I did on other mattresses. Some days I sleep decent. This is a better mattress than the last three I have tried as I can get more than 6 hours of sleep on it before my body completely rebels, but it sleeps hot and I still wake up with aches. I will give it another 30 days or so to see if my body gets used to it, but I am starting to lean towards returning it.Rating mattresses is of course a very personal thing. We are all different. My recommendation on this mattress would be to pass on it, and find one that either had 3"" of memory foam or denser memory foam so you get the true cradle effect memory foam is known for.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 12, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Amazon Basic Memory Foam Mattress', 'author': 'Amazon Customer', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I purchased a memory foam pillow a decade ago. The smell was so horrible that I banished it to the garage. Weeks later the smell was still so strong and offensive that I threw the pillow away.That experience made me very hesitant about purchasing a memory foam mattress, but a close relative assured me that she had experienced no odor when she purchased her memory foam mattress. After talking with her and reading numerous reviews, I made the decision to purchase the mattress above. I offer the following comments to help others decide if they want to try a memory foam mattress.1) Prepare for the EXPANSION EVENT.A memory foam mattress comes in a box and is rolled tightly in plastic. As you unroll the plastic, physics takes over and the mattress starts a growth process you cannot stop.My husband removed the box, stood the mattress up on one end and began unrolling the outer plastic wrapping as I rolled up the plastic he was removing from the mattress. We had cleared a twin size area on the floor. The mattress immediately started expanding and it was necessary to lay it on the floor before we could cut off the heavy plastic bag in which the mattress was sealed under the outer plastic wrapping. Once all the plastic was removed, we left the mattress on the floor for two days to firm up. The third day my husband carried the mattress to its bed frame, where it continued to firm up. Moving the mattress was challenging because the expanded mattress is very wobbly and difficult to handle. We would have needed a second or third person if the mattress had been a larger size. Consider letting the mattress expand on the bed frame so moving it is not necessary.2) PlasticThere is a lot of heavy plastic to dispose of. Find a store or recycling center.3) Waterproof Mattress ProtectorIt is essential to have a waterproof mattress protector and our mattress did not come with one. The mattress is a foam product and anything you spill on it - food, blood, urine, vomit - will stain the foam and is likely to create permanent smells. Amazon has a good selection of waterproof mattress protectors.4) Memory Foam OdorOur mattress had no odor.5) Corners Not ExpandingSome reviewers mention corners that did not fully expand. Our corners expanded fully once the inner bag was removed from the mattress.6) FirmnessHow firm do you want your mattress? After reviews and recommendations, we decided on Amazon\'s medium firm, 10 inch mattress. It is comfortable, and does not ""trap"" you in the foam as some reviewers said could happen with softer mattresses.7) HeatConsider this issue carefully based on your preferences. As you lay on a memory foam mattress you will feel a warmth. This gentle warmth is comfortable and relaxing, and is one reason I would choose a memory foam mattress again. Removing or adding a blanket can help control the heat level.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 27, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars So comfortable and affordable.', 'author': 'Violet', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I had my previous mattress for over five years.

I delved into the customer reviews which I usually pay closer attention to but I was focused on the low price. I read review after review with a bunch of really unhappy customers. So many that I freaked out a little and went to cancel my order and although I thought it would be too late it was not. So I dove back into the mattress pages and after about 6 hours of serious shopping, I found the Vibe. I read every review and there was 77% rated it a 5. There were a couple of haters (there always are)and they were complaining about fiberglass, and apparently, this product had an issue with fiberglass particles sloughing off of it. That didn't make sense 77% gave it a 5. Then I see the company got sued for the fiberglass and then I saw it, the review was from 2013. I did some further research and found yes the company was sued years ago for the fiberglass issue but this problem was rectified completely years ago. So after that, it looks like the company went really hard into quality control and is certified by several companies as 100% all good! Now, I am a 60+ disabled veteran, and the mattress I had, was really soft and comfy but was now leaving me in agony every morning. It was horrible. So I ordered the Vibe Twin XL and paid a little over $200 for it and the price was right in my wheelhouse. It came in a very manageable box, 40 lbs totally deflated, and in two thick plastic bags. I freed the mattress and placed it on my bed frame, wooden slats are fine. Almost immediately, after 1/2 hour, my 12-inch mattress was now 10 inches thick so I could sleep on it that night. It takes about 24 hours to completely reach its full size. There was zero odor, zero issues. The top few inches are some really luxurious dense memory foam. They say it's medium plush but I disagree, I think it is more like medium, medium firm. I went to bed early and slept all night for once in a long time but when I got up, I sat right up and there was... NO PAIN!! I'll always be a little stiff due to age and several motorcycle accidents, but man I was so happy! There is a 10-year warranty as well but for $210 I am ecstatic. I weigh 265lbs. I am fine.

We loved it. The friend had simply needed a bed quickly and he saw that the Vibe is an Amazon Choice. He ordered it and then bought another. I saw the price and clicked ""Buy Now""!I would agree with the assessment that it is ""medium firm"". But this subject has been butchered by opinions from so many directions, it\'s a joke. To qualify: if you are familiar with memory foam bedding, ""medium firm"" is IMO, accurate. If you have been sleeping on a classic inner spring mattress, you might call it soft or ""medium soft"". Let\'s clarify.Beds like this have ""pressure relieving"" softness on top. The Vibe has two inches of it. It really feels soft on the hips and shoulders. But...this bed is also really firm in terms of back support. I think it is the perfect combination of comfort and support - great for sleeping on your back, stomach or side. We have slept on Tempurpedic brand beds and found them comfortable but actually ""hard"" compared to the Vibe.Our history has been classic moderately expensive inner spring mattresses. Plush from Stearns and Foster. Pillow top from Sealy. Each was about $1000 for just the mattress. The vibe is so good I would have been OK with paying that again. But we didn\'t! Ours was $266 (it will be plus or minus based on the day you buy).One complaint which we think will resolve itself. Everyone has a different sense of smell. My wife smells stuff I don\'t and vice versa. The Vibe has an odor. We have been airing it out for a couple days. It does seem to be dissipating.I attached a picture of the bed about 30 minutes after we released it from it\'s plastic captivity. Fun to watch. It\'s about 11"" high and soft. By the next day it was the full 12"" and the firmness set in. While you could probably sleep on this bed right away, we recommend waiting several days for the odor to fade and for the total firmness factor to be established.Based on the hundreds of reviews and sales pitches I have read, I don\'t think you would do better if you spent 4 or 5 times the price - and that is easy to do. If this bed is still performing well in 5 years, then all my effusiveness will be an understatement. Wow. What a bed.Update a few months later: The odor we mentioned has all but disappeared. We have been using this mattress in the guest room and as a secondary bed when one of us is ill. We like it so much that we are planning to swap it with the mattress in the master bedroom. It will be the primary bed for us. I think you could easily spend 3x this price and possibly be less happy. Highly recommend.Update June 2021. We made the swap. The Vibe is our every night bed.

Did not want to spend a ton of money on a mattress right now since might be moving sometime in the near future and who knows what we will want to do then.The thousands of reviews on all of the memory foam mattresses are all over the place! It does not help that, the way Amazon groups the reviews, you cannot always tell exactly which mattress the reviewer purchased (10 inch? 12? Gell/no-gell/hybred??). Here is my impression of the VIBE 12 inch California King Gel Memory We have only had this several weeks, so take that into consideration.First off, the mattress arrived a day earlier than Amazon said it would. That was great for me, but be sure to check your tracking # with the delivery company if you don\'t want yours sitting out in the rain or snow unexpectedly. The box was huge as you would expect for a King size. Not sure exactly how much it weighed, but based on shipping documents, it was somewhere between 80-100 lbs. Don\'t worry too much about someone stealing this off of your porch! Despite the size and weight it was not that difficult for me to ""walk"" the box into the house and then push it up the stairs to the second floor.The hardest part of the unboxing was how many heavy staples were used to close the box. After got it open, the procedure was just like the video. Cut open the outer plastic bag and the thing starts to unroll itself. You can hear the air hissing already into the mattress. Then cut the inner plastic and the thing starts to expand. Funny note: The instruction sheet on how to open the bags is INSIDE the bag! You will want to get the mattress pretty close to where you want it to wind up - especially if you buy a big one - as it expands quickly. The quality of the mattress seems very high. Made in Vietnam. Seems like they do good work there.I was hoping that the mattress would fit into the old waterbed frame so I set it sideways on the bed frame with boards underneath it (see pic 1) to let it expand and air out as many reviews (and the inside-the-bag instructions) all talk about a ""smell"" when you first open it up. However, we notice absolutely no smell from the mattress at any time.Almost immediately the ""outer"" end of the roll (closest to camera in pic 1) expanded to almost 11 inches. The far end was pretty close to the same. The middle was at about 8 inches (pic 2) and only very slowly expanded. It took more than 48 hours for it to get to about 11 1/2 while the two ends went to 12 quickly, so I was worried for a while there would be a big sag, but it eventually evened out.After it got to full size, just spun it 90 degrees, put on some sheets, removed the boards, and it fit perfectly into the old Calif-King waterbed frame.How does it feel? I think some people (and some mattress makers) do not understand the differences between apparent ""softness"" and things like ""compression."" If you just push your hand on the mattress, it feels very-very soft, your hand goes down several inches quite easily with no effort. That is most likely the upper ""gel"" layer. Once you are on the bed however, your body hits and is supported by the next foam layer and that does not give very much at all. This effect is not really noticeable when spread out on your back and weight evenly distributed on the gel, but you really feel it if rolling on your side where there is more weight on smaller pressure points. At the same time, while it is firm, it is different from the firmness of a standard mattress, it is not like a board, there is at least some give even when on your side, but you feel the foam\'s resistance.The end result is, overall, a very firm mattress. It is not as firm as some really hard mattresses I have slept on, but it is up in the top 10-20% or so on firmness I would say with it feeling more firm when on your side than on your backVerdict? For me, this might be the absolute most comfortable mattress ever for lying on you back. Propped up reading a book, you feel like you are floating but with support. It really is amazing., much better than the old waterbed or any standard mattress I have ever been on. On my side, which is how I often sleep, I decided that I would be happier - and would get to sleep sooner - if it was a bit softer. Thus, I purchased one of those quilted pillow-top mattress covers.The mattress also holds heat pretty well, despite the ""cooling gel"" claim. If you are under a comforter or or even a lighter cover that does not ""breath"" the heat is going to build up. The heat dissipates quickly if you pull the covers back. The quilted mattress cover/top I purchased really helped out here so you can get a bit of air between you and the mattress.Overall then this is a very good deal on a very good mattress, and you are saving enough to go ahead and budget for getting a good mattress topper if the firmness or heat is a problem. So, under $300 for a Cal-King mattress that is working this well (so far), is very good price and value.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 21, 2020', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Firm Comfort, Sleeps Cool', 'author': 'T. Bull', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I wanted to replace an 8-inch Tempur-pedic Simplicity Medium mattress at a second residence that I found to be too soft and slept too warm. Having previously purchased and been happy with a Zinus 12-inch Gel-infused Green Tea mattress for a guest room at my primary residence, I planned to buy another one this time. However, the Zinus was out of stock and I did not want to wait, so after reviewing several other brands I opted to order the Vibe 12-inch Gel Memory Foam mattress. As typical with most memory foam mattress reviews, a few people complained that the Vibe was either too soft or too firm, but a high percentage of reviews were very favorable. I am a 6 ft 2 in, weigh 240, sleep mostly on my side, and prefer a firmer mattress, and the Vibe appeared to be a good match for me. After delivery, I rolled out the compressed mattress on the bed slats and opened the bottom end with scissors. The attached picture was taken about an hour after mattress expansion. As many have commented, the corners were a little slower to fill out, but they were in pretty good shape within a few more hours. Some odor, but it mostly dissipated within about 8 hours, and I slept on the mattress that night. If you are sensitive to odors, you may want to wait a bit longer, but I was fine. I was pleasantly surprised with the firmness of the mattress finding the top layer gives enough to be comfortable while the base layers provide excellent support. I don't sink into the foam like I did with the previous Tempur-pedic mattress, so I don't find myself partially waking at night to lift my body up from the depression to roll over. I have also found the Vibe mattress to sleep much cooler than the previous mattress, so I don't find myself waking up sweaty and having to toss off the comforter or top sheet to cool off. Overall, a much higher quality level of sleep with no back aches from too soft of a mattress. Too soon to predict how the mattress will hold up in the long term, but at this point I am very happy with the quality of the materials, the higher quality of sleep I am now getting each night, and I think the Vibe mattress is an excellent value for your dollar if you are looking for a comfortable firm mattress."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 29, 2020', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Nice Support and Comfort', 'author': 'Julie Bishop', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'updated on 12/21/18: still enjoying this mattress. I ended up putting on a kohls ""big one"" mattress topper as I like a soft bed. this mattress was a little firmer than I preferred as I noted in my first review. I read a few reviews saying they found the mattress stayed ""dented"" as they slept on it. I haven\'t found this, I weigh 170 lbs and the mattress refreshes its shape as soon as I move away from the original area. overall, still pretty impressed with this mattress. its on the firm side, but the topper I put on it has made it absolutely perfect and I sleep well, and yes, it does stay cool.Was a little hesitant to buy a gel memory foam mattress online, but after looking in all the stores and their prices, I figured I would take a chance. I am very pleased with my purchase of this king mattress. It is hard to comment on the plushness level as not everyone agrees on what is soft, hard or plush due to their personal taste. I was replacing another regular king foam mattress that I have had for 6 years. I cut it down to queen size for a guest bedroom as I found it so hot to sleep on. It was a great mattress, nice and soft, and I really liked it. But I am a very hot sleeper and was getting tired of waking up several times a night literally sweating (Im in FL). This mattress was put on a king platform bed with bungy boards for support. It expanded to 12"" within about four hours and there was absolutely no odor as I had read some reviewers had a problem with this. It was packed very well, the box was a little beaten up upon arrival, but the mattress is packaged so well, this did not matter. I m in my late 50s and I had no problem dragging it into the house on a dolly and then dragging it into the room. Once I got it out of the box, I had no problem getting it onto the platform bed and removing the packaging and placing it to expand. I have slept on it for about 3 weeks now. At first I thought it might be a little too firm for me, I like a very plush mattress. But I decided to give it a chance as I could always put my old gel memory topper back on if needed. After 3 weeks I find it\'s not too firm, it\'s just right for good support for my back, but plush enough that I sink into it a bit. Once I move, the small indentation goes immediately back to its original shape. And I no longer wake up many times a night in a sweat. The mattress is not overly cooling, I find it just right. The side edges are firm enough to offer support if sitting on the edge. The cover on the mattress is beautiful and high quality. But I still put on a mattress cover just in case. Overall, I am quite happy with this purchase. Buying a mattress online can be intimidating as I am not sure what people do when they have to return a foam mattress.

We needed to upgrade from our queen to a King size bed, and being broke college students we had a very small budget. This mattress seemed almost too good to be true for the price, but because of the good reviews we decided to go for it. I had spent weeks researching just about all memory foam beds in our budget, and this one seemed to fit the bill as far as quality, price, and durability.The bed arrived in the box a day sooner than expected, and was surprisingly easy to carry up the stairs into our bedroom. We unboxed and unwrapped it and let it air out on the floor for about 30 hours. We didn’t really have anywhere else to sleep so we did decide to set it up and sleep on it after only a day and night for it to expand and air out. It was fully expanded by then and had lost any “factory” smell and was absolutely perfect to sleep on. My husband is tall and just over 200lbs, and he’s a side and back sleeper, and I’m also tall and around 140lbs and a side sleeper. We both prefer firmer beds, and this mattress is definitely firm, which is perfect for us. I also have Fibromyalgia though, so I was worried that the bed would be too hard, but it still has lots of cushion and give. We’ve both been sleeping better than ever on it, and my husband says his chronic back pain was gone after sleeping the first night on it.Something important to note is that the entire bed is memory foam, even the edges, so they do slope if you sit/lay right on the edge. This hasn’t been a problem at all for us, especially as we got a King and have plenty of room, but I can see that possibly being a bigger issue if you got a smaller size.Overall I could not be happier, and after 6 months we are still incredibly comfortable and happy with it.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States April 25, 2022', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Our Entire Sleep Set Up is From Amazon and This Bed Is the Bees Knees', 'author': '@misfitrightin', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'We were a bit skeptical of this. We bought it on Prime Day for $270 including a mattress protector. It is by far the cheapest bed me and my wife have owned, but it\'s also the first time we have owned a King bed. Our previous bed was $700+ hybrid. Before that, I owned the Tuft & Needles Queen bed. This surpasses both of them EASILY. Here\'s the run down:Over the past three years, we\'ve slept on a Queen bed. I am a 5\'11 220lbs CrossFitter. I take up a lot of room. She\'s a 5\'4 130lb dainty thing, but she likes to spread out like Shaq when she sleeps. We share the bed with a 40lb Corgi mix, who also seems to think he\'s entitled to at least half of the bed. One of our cats never sleeps with us, but spends most of the night attacking our feet. The other cat sleeps wherever she finds room. Our queen hybrid was awful. We all slept hot and fought for space. I\'m a heavy sleeper, so I never noticed how uncomfortable I was until I woke up groggy and exhausted ALL THE TIME. She woke up dozens of times every night. We were at a point where SOMETHING had to change because no one was all that comfortable (except the dog.......).So we just went for it. A $300 king had to be better than what we had. Our bed arrived three days before our bed frame. Waiting to pop this sucker open was the hardest part. When we finally assembled out new bed (the Zinus Florence and I\'d recommend it HIGHLY), we knew the rules: wait 24+ hours or something before sleeping on it. We live a one bedroom apartment; where is this other place we\'re supposed to sleep? We decided to just do it.And holy crap was it UNCOMFORTABLE. My back was burning the next day. I was miserable. She slept well, but only because there was a chasm of space between everyone in the bed. The dog took up a huge amount of space, but we never noticed him. All the cats even slept on the bed, but we never noticed them. We barely noticed each other. If you\'re living on a Queen bed, a King is like upgrading to the Taj Mahal. Anyway, back to the sleep ...IT WAS AWFUL. So, why am I recommending this bed? Because we didn\'t listen to the instructions. Four hours of having this bed inflate just wasn\'t enough. It felt like sleeping on a slab of hard concrete for me. I dreaded how much my wife liked it because it meant I\'d be stuck with it. Oh well, I thought, that\'s the price I pay for wanting my wife to be happy.But then, something happened. The next night --- a little over 24 hours after the bed had a chance to inflate --- laying down was a DREAM. I sank into that sucker like a melted stick of butter. I slept the sleep of angels. Now I can\'t get off of it. I\'m writing this review from it. Our cat hasn\'t left it in hours. We don\'t even use our couch anymore. This bed is LIFE-CHANGING. It puts my old Tuft & Needles to absolute SHAME. And yes, because we know you\'re wondering, this bed was super comfy to do the naughty stuff on, too... plenty of give and bounce. ;) Anyway, what are you waiting for?

I searched for weeks online for different mattresses at different stores and tried to see who was having specials (I tried to know which one I wanted by Amazon Prime week, but I just wasn't ready to decide by then!). I looked at beds that had thousands of reviews because I thought those would be most reliable due to the quantity of those that had tried the bed. I looked at beds that didn't have a ton of reviews (like this one with I think like 400-700 hundred, I can't remember), and I also did Google searches to find more thorough reviews from professionals. My goal was to buy a king size mattress for $250-$300. I was really close to picking the Amazon Basics (or something like that) and I can't remember exactly what pushed me to this bed, but I think this one was actually a bit less expensive for the 12in size vs the 10 inch and from my research I did gather that the general consensus was to get as many inches as possible (that's what she said) because a memory foam bed probably wouldn’t expand as largely as it should. So the Vibe bed it was!I ordered on a Thursday and it was supposed to arrive on Saturday (the day my new bed was to arrive), but lo and behold I had it by Friday night! As you see the box came it a very good condition (something I think some have complained about). So I am a single woman and had to get it up to my bedroom on the second floor. I will say it took a bit of elbow grease, but I managed to walk it into the house and then slide the box upstairs and into my room. DEFINITELY do not remove the bed from the box until you are ready to open it.Once upstairs, I laid some blankets down and then pulled the box off (while leaving the plastic on). I unrolled the mattress and it expanded to about 8 inches in less than 20 minutes and 10 in less than 20. I couldn't resist trying it out, so I cut the plastic a little bit and crawled in (seems weird, but with two kids I did not want that plastic off until the mattress was going to be immediately covered with a mattress protector and sheet!). It was decently comfy!Like it wasn't super firm by any means, but my ideal bed is one that literally feels like a super soft pillow, so I did notice a difference there, but it was 95% fine. Like I know a topper would take this bed to 110% amazing so I am good with that.Two days later (I didn't really check the next day) and the bed was fully at it's 12 inches. I was VERY impressed, because the pics in some review of memory foam beds made it look like the edges of the mattress never really took on a rounded square shape. Not this one! This bed fully looks like a completely even, regular mattress.And I have been super tired lately so that could contribute, but honestly I have never slept better on a bed! I set an alarm to wake me up halfway though the night so I can see that I have more time to sleep, and with this bed I always miss that alarm!I snuggle up in this bed with my nice warm comforter and that is all she wrote!I have no comment about whether the mattress gets hot, because with comforters I would have no idea how someone is able to attribute being hot to the mattress and not, um the covers?Overall the only thing that could make this bed better is if it was just a smidgen softer, but truly for the price I would definitely pick this bed again.Some memory foam users complain that the sides begin to sag eventually so I am praying I don't encounter that. Overall, I know this review is rather lengthy, but I wanted to give a review that would have empowered me to take the plunge when I was shopping. Hope this helps!8/5/20 Update:As a single person I sleep on one side of the bed and I will admit this side is lower.

Those being my back, shoulders,my thoracic spine due to an extremely rare Thoracic Spinal Dural Fistula which was taking me out big time and quickly. My neck is toast, have R.S.D. , migraines, and can have seizures and continue to have dysfunction of my autonomic nervous system which causes a lot of fun as you can imagine. With this comes many fun things which keeps me quite busy, lol. Even though one pushes through the pain which can feel unbearable at times. No matter, we all have to sleep at some point. It seems this is where the challenge begins. I mentioned this only for this and hopefully to help others in reading this review. Pain is part of living. I embrace both. My view is as long as I feel pain I'm still kickin it and feel truly grateful for both. Again I only mentioned this to get to the point of my review of this bed. I've tried many things to sleep on some intentional and some not, lol. Soft beds,firm beds, futons, single size up to Cal King with and without foam. The last three beds I've slept on as I would try all of them at various times in various rooms of my home. With my last purchase going against my common sense, I bought a plush, which set me back $1,400 what a waste. My doctor gave me a prescription that a rep from this Co. was seeking approval through my Insurance which cost $22,000 a month to fill. I don't know maybe it was just me but I just felt that was a bit steep for a few hours of sleep.You could say it was the combination of the lack of and quality of sleep, the pain in my joints while laying in bed and after waking up in the a.m. and feeling like I was 35 yrs. pay my age and that the pain would continue into my day, that said I thought this bed is winning the battle against me and I should just try again to check out and hopefully get a better bed.I did say better, I didn't say more expensive. I wanted to emphasize the price the price I paid for this bed. I have to say I went out and started researching everything on Amazon and also other companies reading the reviews and I kept coming back to this bed. Seriously the price, or lack of price gave me hesitation but for some reason the bed did not.After getting burned for 1400 bucks I just thought what did I have to lose as the reviews were great. As I seem to find with all reviews, it doesn't matter what product a laptop etc. some people seem like they don't like anything, that's their right and they have the right to their opinion. Now to finally get to the point of this. I ordered the king size bed and the mattress cover. Go figure, by adding the mattress cover it brought the price down an extra 80 dollars below the cost of the bed alone without the cover but including the cover.I dunno...It made the decision even easier to buy it. I found the price unbelievable and bought it. Once delivered, I rolled it out let it sit for day and a half made the bed and was anxious to see what would happen latter that night.All I could tell say is soon as I got under the to cover as I didn't get under the sheet. I zonked out and slept for 10 hours straight, without waking that night.I'm not lying, I swear to God.I love the heck out of this bed,man the price is unreal and it's just an awesome bed at least for me. So all I can tell you is if you go to bed sore wake up worse feeling like you're 110 and wake up during the night because of pain, toss and turn wake up frequently and you want all that to end try this bed.I did and it's the best money I've ever spent honestly, I'd sign a sworn affidavit. I also wanted to state that I've never heard of this company before I started doing research on Amazon. I didn't get paid for this review nor did I get a discount of any sorts, incentives or any thing kickback.I paid full price minus huge savings after adding an extra $27 for the cover which save me another 80 bucks including the cover which I still don't understand that but. Again I strongly reiterate that I've never, ever heard of this company before I researched beds on Amazon. I took chance after reading all of the many reviews and many beds and I'm now sleeping on the best bed I've had. I can honestly say I have no regrets and I've just been so madly impressed by this bed.I was amazed at how truly horrible what I thought were good beds. They had caused my body so much grief and pain. All I can honestly say for me it was truly like a light switch and that's no BS. The beds I've been sleeping on were causing me to only get a few hours of sleep. Not to mention the poor quality of sleep I was getting. Also much of the pain at night and carrying over into the day ( what a vicious cycle) was due to having such a pathetic bed that I paid so much more for. Please don't start charging more for the bed. As I'd feel bad maybe that my review had some reflection and caused the price to increase. All of these opinions are mine,of my free will and it's the way I honestly feel.No one contacted me nor asked me to review this. I waited many months to add my review of this bed so I could honestly try and provide my sole and honest opinion. Again the information I put in this review was personal and was only given/said/provided to give insight into possibly trying to help others with respect to purchasing this bed in hope that others might experience some benefit from this bed as I have.I made this review after careful consideration and time waiting what I felt was a reasonable amount of time so as to provide many months of sleep and use of this product so as I felt that I could actually give it a reasonable and accurate assessment. Hopefully it will help others. I tossed the $1,400 bed and was glad to do so.

I\'ve never seen so obvious defective width before, in the 2 dozen mattresses I\'ve owned in my life. Besides shrinking a size that\'s borderline big enough for two full-sized aduilts, it leaves an unsightly gap at the edge of the fitted frame.And then there\'s the foam smell- it had a STRONG, pervasive, wafting scent when I lifted the covers for the first 2 weeks, even just walking into the room. Though I left it uncovered and with a window fan venting the room for its first day. Even now (4.5 weeks later in warm weather), the sheets smell distinctly of foam, there\'s a mild waft of synthetic smell when I lift the the covers. Not what I expected in 2023.Note I don\'t even have a sensitive nose, but I DO have sensitive skin... and the heavy dosing of VOCs seemed to give me hives (not normal for me) sporadically in the first couple of weeks. Serta should be insisting on low-VOC foam, or figuring out how to air the product before packaging. The extra-strong smell and the wrong size implies they\'re packaging up the mattress at the factory without even enough of a pause to inspect the product.The last issue is more generic: in just a month, the side of the bed I sleep on (200lbs) already has the pillowtop squashed, but the other side is not. Possibly it\'ll squash evenly, but depending on how you sleep and if your sleep partner is a different size than you, you likely will end up with a ""trench"" where you sleep.It\'s still a pretty firm mattress under the pillowtop (it\'s not super cushy), so I think I would skip the pillowtop. Reducing that type of foam might help the smell also.I would have given 3.5 stars because the sleep is GOOD. But at this price range, even if everything is outsourced by brands that have shrunken down to mere marketing organizations, Serta should still be making sure of quality control at the factory, and dealing with issues like foam off-gassing of VOCs, so I rounded down.I\'m going to try the 14-inch (non-pillowtop) and hope its accurately sized. If you\'re buying, make sure to check the width, which might be apparent at a glance.

What are you waiting for? Quality, affordability and comfort', 'author': 'M. Johnson', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'EDIT: 20 month post purchase update (original review below)-So far so good. I felt like this mattress has a little more “give” where I sleep. I’m not the kind of person who sleeps all over the bed. I sleep in one spot. So, when I moved to my new home, I turned it around and it has solved the problem. The area where I slept before shows no signs of the “give.” I sleep alone, so I don’t know how it affects couples. I’m 5’3”, 165lbs (160cm, 75Kg).I do recommend a mattress protector only because of the porous fabric. I learned this on the night of the pukies from my three-year-old daughter.In other news, I recommended this mattress to a friend and she bought it. She sleeps more soundly than she did on her innerspring mattress. I have added the photos from when we unzipped and let the mattress decompress. SHE LOVES IT. She says she read the conflicting reviews, but decided it was worth it because I wouldn’t shut up about it. If she only gets a few years out of it, she still thinks it’s a worthwhile investment because her sleep is so much better and her aches and pains are about gone. Her FitBit has shown a much better sleep pattern.Almost two years later and I’m still in love with this mattress and the frame I bought to go with it.I waited to write this review after having this mattress for about six months. I like to have a product a while before writing a review. When this bed arrives, it comes in a box that is about 18""x 18""x 48"". That\'s an estimated size by memory. You pull the bed out and lay it out. It comes compressed and folded in half. Then, check for the zipper on the bed. Make sure that is on the bottom and open the plastic. The bed begins to decompress. Let it decompress for 24-48 hours. I let it decompress for 48 hours because I was moving into a new apartment and I had the time to do it. I put it on the Home Life Cloth Light Beige Cream Linen 51"" Tall Headboard Platform Bed with Slats Queen - Complete Bed 5 Year Warranty Included 008 Home Life Cloth Light Beige Cream Linen 51"" Tall Headboard Platform Bed with Slats Queen Bed and it looks amazing.Pros: Comfort! It does NOT sleep hot. I don\'t feel myself tossing and turning at night. I lay there, and I sink in, but not too much. It doesn\'t take too much effort to move like some lower density mattresses. Sheets do not slip off and they hold really well, so that\'s a big plus. The soft fabric covering the mattress holds sheets well and the stitched in pattern does not bleed through on white sheets. When I sit on the edge to play my guitar, it\'s the perfect height and my back feels great- better than any chair.Cons: I see a lot of reviews about the smell. I have a hyper sense of smell. The chemical smell dissipated in a few hours. I did not detect it at all after about six hours. Get the plastic the mattress came in out of your house if you don\'t want the smell lingering. The mattress is heavy, but that just indicates the quality of the product. Besides, all mattresses are heavy unless they are full of air. When it\'s cold, the bed becomes harder. When its hot, the bed is softer. Keep that in mind when adjusting the temp of the room. And when I say cold, I\'m talking 35 degrees F. I left the heat off when I went out of town and the bed was denser than usual when I got back. I warmed up the room and it went quickly back to normal. On hot nights it is softer. I doubt you\'re sleeping in freezing temps, so this isn\'t a big deal.All in all, this thing is a great buy. I\'m glad that Amazon has made it as a recommended product. It\'s comfortable and priced well. The queen sized one works well with a slat bed and after six months has continued to provide a restful night sleep. I\'ll try to remember to give it another review at the one year mark.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 11, 2018', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': ""5.0 out of 5 stars So soft but firm enough that you don't sink in"", 'author': 'gummybear26', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I was afraid this would be a gamble.

I was thinking about a hybrid since I was afraid this wouldn\'t have enough support but this had a mix of support for your back and a cradling so side sleepers (like me) don\'t feel pain on their hips. The quality it is amazing and the price is unbeatable. I did find others that were a bit cheaper but I wanted to pay a bit more for this one since it had better reviews. **Pat on the back. I did good,lol.*Soft-The material is soft and by this I mean the cover. I have yet to be able to remove it but will be wearing gloves when I do (as others have said it has fiberglass since it is flame retardant). It is used with sheets but the designs are not felt beneath it or anything.*Filled out-I left it the 72 hours as it suggested to fully fill out before she used it but it actually mostly filled out instantly. It did have a weird smell that I couldn\'t put my finger on but it wasn\'t strong. I want to say chemical smell maybe the foam or foam glue they use but I was literally face to mattress smelling it (as another reviewer did the same and smelled nothing) my nose it sensitive and I did smell something luckly it went away by the end of the day while waiting for it to puff out. So I am not going to remove stars but you should be aware. It doesn\'t smell like anything now and there was a corner that did completely fill out until the second day. It kind of dipped downward and I thought I would stay like that but it fixed itself. So I would say (if you can) leave it the 3 days. It actually took a pounding as I left it in the living room to air out (against a couch) and my kids decided to use it to lye on and try and roll down (inbetween my scolding I thought it would bend it too much). It actually didn\'t bend or anything and held their weight. I was pleasantly surprised.Weight-This thing is heavy. I had to drag the box inside and when opened I found a Grey material that was wrapped around it protecting it I believe. Once I opened it was hard to carry but it is a good thing to me as it meant it was made of quality material.Cons:*can\'t reach the zipper-So there is a tiny pencil sized pocket that holds the zipper and I couldn\'t pull it out. I was waiting to be sure there was nothing wrong with it (just in case I had to return it if it didn\'t puff out or something) but now that I know I will keep it looks like I am going to have to cut the pocket open to reach the zipper. Not sure why that design was made but it is something to note.Conclusion:*I love it and I am afraid of making g purchases for large items just in case I have to return it. The hassle is a lot for something so large but this was a great purchase. It will hold my 200+ weight and not sink in but still cradle me. My tiny daughter (whom I bought it for) loves it just as much because it is not ""too soft"" which is what we were afraid of from a foam mattress. Problems with shipping lead to using it alone until the frame arrives. However, it is awesome just as it is as the bottom of the foam seems to be strong enough to support your weight and spinal alignment. I will update my review when used with the frame. This mattress was a great purchase and we will be ordereding two more (of different sizes) in the future.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States March 15, 2021', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect', 'author': 'Cat Lady', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'This mattress is perfect. I ordered a Queen size.All my life I\'ve slept on spring/coil mattresses and have grown to really hate them as I age because the springs cause more pain than they do anything else.When I saw this mattress and it\'s affordable price (budget friendly) I wanted to give it a try and get away from the 21-year-old spring mattress that I have been sleeping on.This mattress is packaged in a large, heavy box and wrapped in plastic. It unrolls after you pull the plastic off and then unfolds. Once I had all the plastic off of the mattress it started to fluff up and was the full 10"" within 3 hours. I was able to sleep on it the same night it arrived. There is a slight ""new"" smell that has been on every memory foam mattress topper I\'ve bought, so this, of course, will go away in a few days and isn\'t too strong or overwhelming.Actually, this mattress is pretty light compared to the old spring mattress I have and found it to not be a problem putting it on the frame by myself.I do want to note this mattress is firm but not painful firm like a spring mattress that causes so much pain from coils that poke into your joints and body as you sleep. This mattress is firm at first but once you settle in the foam contours to your body and makes it very comfortable to sleep.Generally, I have trouble sleeping on anything firm, like my old mattress, even at 21 years of use, it is so firm that it feels the same as day 1 (painful and like sleeping on a slab of concrete).I have 2 back injuries and laying down on my back or stomach is very painful. Mostly I am a side sleeper but even then on a spring mattress, I wake up several times a night from either my shoulders and hips hurting so badly that I can barely roll over to the other side without feeling like my bones are shattering, but my arm falls asleep. It is hard for me to get comfortable on my old mattress and I wake up in more pain than I went to sleep in.WIth this mattress, I can lay down and quickly settle, even on my back without waking up in severe pain or with my arm falling asleep. In fact, I can sleep a whole night comfortably and wake up without pain. I\'m amazed by that and know now that it is the mattress that caused so much pain all these years to my already painful bones.On all the mattress toppers I\'ve had before, and there have been many, they all slept hot. I\'d wake up even in winter sweating and with this mattress, I don\'t wake up sweating. It actually feels cool and comfortable.I really can\'t say enough good things about this mattress. It is light to move around and even on a platform bed frame, I can\'t feel the metal underneath. It feels like I am sleeping on a cloud. My bones don\'t ache anymore from sleeping and I am not waking up multiple times a night in pain. And I don\'t really like firm mattresses anymore, not after my old nightmare mattress that felt like sleeping on concrete. But this one is much different from being on a spring mattress and is also firm but very comfortable.Pros:Light to move aroundThick enough not to feel the metal bed frame on a platform frameFirm but not something you sink into or are uncomfortable on. Contours to the body and feels like sleeping on a marshmallow.Same thickness as a traditional spring mattress, 10"" of softness and no springsGood qualitySleeps cool, not hotHas a zippered cover that is plush and soft2 people can sleep on this mattress and not feel each other move or get upDid I mention it feels like sleeping on a marshmallow?Cons:0If you haven\'t tried this mattress yet and are in the market for a budget-friendly (could even sleep with it on the floor if you don\'t have a frame and be comfortable), firm yet very cozy, good quality mattress, this is the one. I am happy to have found this mattress and would recommend it to everyone looking for an upgrade from spring mattresses. I\'ll never go back to another spring mattress again. Not even my son (almost 3 years old) sleeps on a spring mattress. My son sleeps on a much smaller version of this mattress, of a different brand (Graco crib mattress) but still feels the same firmness (comfortable as well) and he sleeps the night through.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 26, 2017', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Great buy', 'author': 'Jose Irizarry', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'Comfortable!

Even without the box spring! This one caught my attention because of the price as well as the fact that this is foam instead of a spring mattress. We have always had spring mattresses that are great at first but overtime they caused more pain than they were worth. So we were drawn to a foam mattress. I looked at countless reviews and thought this was the best priced and had some great reviews.Shipping. It came super quick! I ordered this Sunday and had it by Friday. My husband went ahead and opened it up so we could let it inflate throughout the day and overnight to see how it did. Within just a couple hours it was already inflated to almost its full thickness. We still gave it the rest of the day, overnight and the rest of the next day to make sure it was completely inflated before we slept on it. (I also had to put together the frame we bought as well so it gave it some more time). After I got the frame together, we was super easy to get the mattress on the frame. Its heavy and awkward to move by yourself so I do suggest two people to move it.Once we made the bed and got everything situated, I literally laid in bed for the rest of the day. This mattress is amazing so far! It feels like I'm laying on firm air! The memory foam on top is soft but firm enough to support and conform to your body instead of letting you sink. I had back pain all day while I was building the frame and getting everything ready. Within just an hour of laying on it, watching TV, I was no longer in pain. It was so nice to switch from laying on a board to laying on firm air. It supported my body while I was laying on my back, sides and stomach. Im mainly a side sleeper and that usually makes my sides, hips and back hurt even if it's just for a short amount of time of laying like that. This mattress did not make me feel that way! I was able to get up throughout the rest of the day without feeling like I had been laying around all day. That's with me not even sleeping on it yet!Last night was our first night sleeping on it. Let me tell you, I have not been sleeping well at all for the last few months cause I would be in pain all night from our other mattress. I would wake up feeling like I was hit by a truck. Everything would hurt constantly overnight and I would get up with pain all throughout my body. This morning, I woke up with absolutely no pain. I feel refreshed and I slept all throughout the night! I didn't wake up constantly and I even slept in! That has been impossible for me for months! It's such a huge relief to not wake up in pain!Me and my husband have three large dogs (huskies) that love to lay in bed with us while we sleep. They kick and get in the uncomfortable spots between us and push us out of the bed almost every night. Last night, they slept on the bed with us (of course) and it's like they weren't there. All three of them were laying between us and I couldn't even tell because there is SO MUCH ROOM! There is such a huge difference in a queen to a king mattress that I'm upset that I didn't have one sooner! I can tell that even they slept better because they didn't wake me up at the crack of dawn! They snoozed until I finally woke up! They even looked like they were offended that I was up to be able to let them outside, cause they wanted to keep sleeping! So overall, I belive that this is a winner for all of us! Get this mattress! You won't regret it!"", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 10, 2021', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Wonderful for back pain sufferers. This mattress is more amazing than I thought it would be!', 'author': 'Donna Loves Reviews', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'This Gel Infused Memory Foam Mattress is more amazing than we thought it would be! We moved into a new home and really needed to get a new mattress for our children, we also did not want to break the bank. I also really wanted to get a new mattress for our bed because of my back. A friend of ours recommend a mattress similar to this one because it helped her back pain and that is what I searched for on Amazon. I came across this mattress and read all of the reviews. They were very positive with lots of detail. Many reviewers that suffer with back and neck pain had positive results with this mattress and that helped me to make a choice. So, we decided to buy a few of these mattress and also one for us, we are more than happy we did!This has got to be the softest and most comfortable mattress I have ever slept on! It is soft but, firm enough not to make my back hurt. I have not slept this good since before my back injury. My husband also loves this mattress and has not complained once, he sleeps better on this mattress as well. Our kids just love it! They are so happy and thrilled with it! They love the way it feels and have also slept very well on it.Having a mattress that would help me sleep better was very important to me as well as the price. I suffer from 2 failed lower back surgeries and also a cervical surgery and sleeping has always been difficult for me. I am up a few times a night because the pain wakes me or I just can’t get comfortable. I have purchased many different kinds of pillows and foam toppers to help me feel better and get a better nights sleep, they have helped to a certain degree but, nothing has compared to this mattress. Not that I am pain free, nor will I ever be but, I am at least sleeping better and not waking up as frequently. I find that I sleep better on a softer bed than a harder one. I tend to get even more back pain when the bed is too hard. So, if you should need a mattress that is on the hard side this might not work because it is on the softer side.The mattress was delivered rolled up and wrapped in plastic. We followed the instructions and unrolled the mattress which is completely flat, then we took off the plastic shrink wrapping and the mattress then started to expand. (Some reviewers stated that there was a slight odor and yes, there is, but it is nothing that bad and does go away after you let the mattress breath.) We allowed the mattress to expand and air out for 72 hours before we placed it on the bed frame. At this point the mattress was completely full and there was no odor. It is wonderful that there is no box spring needed, you just put it ontop of your framed bed. We put the sheets on and went to sleep!This really is the best mattress I have ever slept on and owned. I could not be happier and so is the rest of my family. The price is just amazing!

This one has not fully expanded and it has been 2 days. Not only that but when I pull upwards on the mattress to see where the remainder would lift, it literally CANNOT be stretched upto 12 inches in height. This is false advertisement. The mattress is also 1inch short of the 60inches in width that a Queen is supposed to be. You can try to push in on any part of the mattress and with little effort you can feel the springs and even hear them creak and move.

The corners took a little longer but we were using this bed within a couple of days. We have had it now for a couple of months and I feel like it\'s even more comfortable as it\'s broken in. It is more firm than I expected however we had prior been sleeping on a very worn well-known brand mattress that honestly was causing us so much back pain, hip pain and discomfort, I am relieved we gave this a try. We should have been sleeping on a more firm bed I have realized. My hips are no longer hurting. I have been waking up feeling rested for the first time in a long time! I love the memory foam plus individually wrapped coils. With two of us (and often two dogs) in the bed, the mattress is holding up well. We are both over 200# and have two large dogs. We might try adding a 1-2"" foam topper but honestly the mattress is really comfy as is. The edges are not as firm as store bought mattresses and you will sink down a bit if sitting on the edge of the bed but it\'s not been a problem. We don\'t feel as if we will roll off. There is also really NO problematic movement in the bed if one person rolls over or shifts, it does not disturb the other person! I don\'t know how well this bed will hold up over time but it has a 10 year warranty. It seems very well made, it is comfortable and I imagine we will get at least a few years out of it.

I mention it only so that you remember what's in that box when you try to wrestle it into the house alone. Once upstairs in into our master bedroom, everything was a cinch. It came out of the box quite easy and we opened the vacuum seal as instructed, and the mattress immediately came to life expanding. (make sure you open the seal in an open space large enough for it to unroll and expand) After it looked like a regular mattress, we put it up on the bed frame and left it for a few hours. The instructions said something like 24 hours required, but it was ready by bed time.When I first sat on it, I doubted. It felt too soft and like there was too much give for a medium firmness mattress. However, my doubts were laid to rest, literally, when I lay down and slept. The mattress was more comfortable than our previous one, which we bought in a show room over a decade ago. Plus, our old mattress was nearly 3x the cost!So far it's been a week. I'm still enjoying how the top few inches are pillowy soft, and it shapes to the contours of my body when I roll - something my old mattress didn't have. It feels just right on my back, which means not too soft and not too hard.I would recommend this mattress, especially at this price.

We wanted to give it the best chance to expand and inflate or whatever, and after all this time, it’s just ok.Biggest cons: the corners never fully fill or expand, if you sit on one accidentally it’s a fun experience because you just sink completely down; the spots where we sleep are molded into the sides of the mattress while the middle is like of elevated, so it’s sunk down area where we actually sleep then a little plateau in the middle.

Now when the delivery guy just hoisted it up on his shoulder and set it on my porch, I thought how heavy can it really be? I found out pretty quickly! Now I’m not a weakling but I struggled getting the box up a small step into my house! I admit, after that I dragged it to my bedroom!Set up was easy. Unboxed it. Unrolled the mattress. This is where I must share a warning of caution…..When you are unrolling the plastic from the air suctioned plastic…. Make sure your pants are secured and that the rolling doesn’t catch the bottom of your pants. Needless to say, I did not. My pajama pant legs got caught up in the rolling unbeknownst to me, as I was excitedly pulling the plastic and I got de-pants! After fixing the breezy situation, I had a good laugh.The mattress started filling up even before removing the air suctioned plastic. I quickly removed that. Filled out pretty nicely after about 12 hours and finished filling out by 72 hours.I do admit that my partner and I did have to sleep on it about 14 hours after setting it up, as we had no where else to lay our weary heads. It held up well. It did continue to fill out for the rest of the 72 hours. No problem there.The bed is more on the softer side but firm enough. As someone who has hip and back problems from sleeping on poor quality mattresses in the past, I was relieved to wake up without the morning pains! It feels like a nice hug that engulfs and supports you at the same time.The only cons we have experienced, and I waited a month and a half to write this, is the sides and corners are really not very supportive. Sitting on the edge of the bed is out of the question, unless you have your tushy way back on the bed itself. Otherwise you’re getting yeeted onto the floor.The other con is it is not motion isolating… at all. I can feel every move my partner makes when he rolls over or gets in or out of bed. In fact when he gets in bed, I swear it’s like the force is drawing me closer into him! I love him but I need my space sometimes lolSide note, if you are putting this on a platform bed frame, invest in some stoppers. The mattress will slide…. Constantly.

I will not sleep on an uncomfortable mattress. I recently bought a Serta-Simmons Beautyrest Silver BRS900 “Plush” King-sized mattress (They are no longer Simmons Beautyrest since they merged or got bought out). It seems since the merger they have completely destroyed the Beautyrest brand. I slept on Beautyrest mattresses for years that were very comfortable for the price. It seems that Serta-Simmons business practice is to make their entry level beds extremely uncomfortable, in order to steer customers towards paying thousands of dollars for one of their “Black Series” mattresses, which IMO are not even that comfortable. I personally tested out half a dozen Serta-Simmons Beautyrest Black series mattresses at mattress firm, and none of them were comfortable. The Silver line is just above their entry level mattress and cost me about $750 from Mattress Firm. That mattress was not remotely plush as it was advertised. It was firm. It was so uncomfortable that I started sleeping on my couch due to the severe hip pain it was causing me. I figured it was a long shot, but bought this mattress because many of the reviews described it as being “bouncy” and “soft”. The Serta-Simmons “Beautyrest” was definitely not bouncy or soft, it was stiff as a board. They should change their name to “Painfulrest”. The purveyors of Molblly should be proud of their product. I was prepared to be disappointed but they proved me wrong. This bed is very comfortable, and I can now sleep peacefully and wake up pain free*. Thank you Molblly, and for anyone considering buying a mattress, I highly recommend staying away from the Serta-Simmons Beautyrest brand, as since the merger between them and Serta (In my opinion Serta was always low-tier in terms of quality and comfort) their quality and comfort for the price has drastically been diminished.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 30, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '3.0 out of 5 stars Quite a bit softer than I expected', 'author': 'JR Siever', 'rating': 3, 'content': 'This is my first hybrid bed (inner spring plus foam), so it was a bit of a gamble.

I decided to sleep on the mattress for a week or two before I wrote my review to make sure that we were satisfied with it.

Not only was it nearly fully inflated after only about 8-9 hours, but it continued to fill over the next 24 hours even after used that first night.Another thing we noticed is that in my research a lot of people complained that other mattresses did not fill on the edges making it unable to be sat on without slipping off. Not with this mattress! Even the corners were filled and firm and we both are able to sit on the edge. We both are 200- 300 pounds respectfully and we have had the best sleep than we have had in years! My wife said after the first night that she slept like a baby and had minimal to no pain in her body, even her knee which she has had surgery on five times was not as painful.

Although I was weary thinking this thing may smell after reading some comments, IT DOES NOT!So it has been 36 hours since the arrival of my mattress. Unboxing was a breeze (and I liked they included a letter opener to not damage the mattress with a knife) I rolled it out and let it start its thing. I read a review where someone got theirs to fully expand in 13 hours? I believe, and that was my goal. I put a fan facing the mattress, opened a window, and let it go. 5 hours passed and I was surprised to see it looked almost fully expanded I was ecstatic, and ready to feel this thing, but I waited. About 10 hours passed and I was getting tired, the wife was already sleeping on the couch, I checked on the mattress and it didn\'t look like much had changed since the 5 hour mark, but I said I don\'t even care I laid on it... just to feel it, and next thing I know my wife\'s waking me up in the morning asking why am I sleeping on this before it\'s ready. Oh yeah I did it and it was SOOOO comfy xD.So now as a write this, I still don\'t believe it is fully expanded (36 hours), it\'s almost there but there is still a little sag to the container or what ever we call it.

I rolled it out at about 7pm, and now it's 12pm the next day and I am not disappointed, YET. I followed the instructions and it says the amount of time to allow the mattress to expand.

It really is a great bed and I have no complaints! It expanded to its full potential of 12inches, no defects and I have not sweated one dag on time (old lady thing going on) but yeah... it was cheaper than I even wanted to spend so it's a win win for me! Good Luck!Update 10/1/2023:: So... I had to buy a EXTRA FIRM Mattress topper because we kept sinking. But that's not the companies fault, I choose the FIRM mattress instead of a EXTRA FIRM.

NO , it never goes away. Ive had it for 2 years now. Update. 3 years . Still , the smell of this is SO STRONG. Like , its not even gone down a little bit since the day I bought it. That is with the wrapped sheets. I needed to use plastic wrap or something. I wont be taking this with me when I move and I wont be buying another one. However, giant foam style does have its advantages. I will say that it hasnt lost any form or function after all this time and I know springs would have been permanently worn and sagging by now. I sit in the same spot on this bed all day so it will sag after a while. Rotate it around and its good to go for another week. It will sag a little but I mean ive had fully supported and cushy rest for 3 years straight with no signs of this material weakening. It smells like textile chemicals though but if you solve that, or at least dampen it , it should serve you well. I weight 140lbs. This is also important. You dont want to get the thickness I got and weigh more than 150. At 140 im fully supported but after hours , when its fully settled, im supported but I can feel that I have no more room left for compression. Certain positions of sitting will hurt your back if your not sitting with your back against something. This is one property that spring mattresses beat it on. The support while sitting indian style with no back rest is terrible. Basically its not really stiff enough. In my opinion , whatever the stiffest you can get , get it. It will still be soft and cushy because its foam but you wont sink as much and that will save your back. Its pretty great for sleeping flat though. In that respect it feels better than spring mattresses that were good. My grandmothers bed was the most comfy ever but it wore out too. This foam doesnt really wear out but its never going to be quite as stiff as a spring set could be even on the thickest version. I have a queen it says but its closer to a Full+ . For my size I dont think two people would fit under every circumstance comfortably. Sure two people can fit but rolling in the night and the extra room for all that wont be there. You also cant rely on stock frames. Because it has no springs you need a lot of wooden planks on your frame to keep from sagging down in a spot that isnt supported(you will drop). I had to buy 6x8 wooden boards to lay on the metal frame and it took freakin 7 of em. I really should have gotten 9. No, not a single flat piece of sub floor. Trust me. Planks. Dont spill anything on it because its a giant sponge. I always sit on it with plenty of blankets and sheets underneath. Im grateful for it even though the smell sucks. If im honest, if you dont cover it or wrap it, you wont be able to bear it.Pros - Living alone, you just sleep on a different side each night or even switch sides in the middle of the night for good support and comfort all night. It doesnt wear down like a spring mattress does and with the use of support pillows, you can get all the comfort you really need out of a single person. 10 inch is the minimum thickness in my opinion. Its lighter than most and can be easily moved around the room on its base. The queen I got gives my 5 10 inch body plenty of room all around. I can sprawl out any which way I want.Cons - The smell is always strong unless you wrap it up. I even tried plastic wrap at one point but switched to 2 king sized sheets. If you keep it wrapped it will cut the smell down by 70 percent.Dont spill anything on it but water. Its a giant sponge. To clean a spill, you will need to equally soak it again and then sponge it up somehow. Avoid all spills on foam matts. It does form to your body after a while and it can lead to higher body temps. Choose bed sheets that are light and comforters that let your body breathe more than the thicker fluffier others. Avoid large pillows for your head as the body will sink a little into the foam. Avoid really firm pillows for the same reason. It can be a little tricky to find the right balance of heat of comfort but I enjoy this mattress anyway. Its a bit of a pain, but its been better value for something equal in springs. A queen mattress with springs with the support I want would be much more than this cost me.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States November 11, 2021', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Moblly gel memory mattress', 'author': 'Missy', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'Needed to replace my broken down old mattress on a tight budget.

I uploaded a picture to the customer image gallery so people what the Queen Size looks like.This mattress expanded to its full 8"" height in about 6 hours, but I cannot sleep on it yet, because of the intense chemical odor. I did lay down on it to ""test drive"" it for a while, & I am pleasantly surprised by how comfortable it is. I was leery of buying this bed because I have been sleeping on an airbed for 2 years, & I expected a foam mattress to feel like laying on a concrete slab in comparison - but it isn\'t. Not at all. It is not like the horrible foam mattresses I\'ve encountered in motels & guest beds & spent sleepless nights on in the past. This is actually really nice. All of the foam beds I\'ve experienced felt like a foam mattress topper laying on a sidewalk, so I was afraid to invest much, but this bed is actually quite agreeable. Keep in mind, it\'s not like spring mattresses which have a resistive bounce to them - & it does kind of squish around you & cradle your form where you lay (which some people don\'t like)...but the mattress I was sent is neither too firm nor too soft - it really is just about right. I sink into the body-conforming top layers just the right amount, without feeling like I am ""bottoming out"". All of my pressure points sink in at the right depths, in the right places. There may be truth to the notion that the thinner memory foam mattresses are more comfortable, compared to thick 12"" mattresses, because the thinner beds lack the dense 6-8"" resistive base layer of foam that makes the thicker beds so firm. When I tested it out, I was enjoying the sound of the vertebrae in my back popping back into place so much that I hated to get up... It felt great, & only my asthma drove me off the bed.About the chemical odor, I would recommend that those with allergies, asthma, & hypersensitivity to chemicals set up alternative sleeping arrangements for 4 or more days to allow this mattress to fully air out. You don\'t notice it right away after unwrapping the bed, but the more it expands, the stronger the odor becomes. I also bought this bed a zippered vinyl mattress cover as an allergy blocker, so together the two of them smell like the interior of a new car, splashed with a bucket full of paint... : } I shut the mattress in the bedroom, & I air it out with a fan about 4 times a day. I put the ailing airbed in the living room to use while I transition to the new bed. I have had 4 airbeds suddenly go flat in the middle of the night in less than 2 years, so for me it\'s worth the wait to air out just 1 memory foam mattress once - rather than 1 new air bed about every 6 months, all of which smelled every bit as strong as this bed does. Some people shaved off 1 Star for the stench, but I am giving it the full 5 Stars, because it is so unexpectedly comfortable. I never knew a memory foam mattress could feel this decent. I was terrified of how bad this was going to be, & actually almost canceled the order, but so far it\'s actually very nice.I manage fibromyalgia, arthritis, upper & lower back pain, & recurring nerve pain in my arms, & I think I am going to do quite well sleeping on this mattress. I have a feeling that the more I sleep on this bed, the more my back is going to realign itself to where it\'s supposed to be. King Size was unavailable when I made my purchase, which I prefer, but I think Queen is about the largest mattress one small person in chronic pain can lug around by themselves if I ever have to move again.One Major Con: Best Priced Mattress really needs to use better quality cardboard boxes to ship their mattresses. My box ripped open in transit, & apparently hit the ground quite hard, then at some point was retaped. When it arrived, the box contents were full of FedEx truck grime, exhaust stink, & about 10 pieces of large limestone gravel rattling around in the box. That is NOT cool, but the bed itself was sealed in its own bag, & although the bag was cruddy, & got my floor dirty, the mattress itself was not affected by the mess. Best Priced Mattress...if you really believe you make a great product...please ship it to the customer with the respect it deserves.11/14/11 Update:The mattress & vinyl casing did take 4 full days for all of this to air out. The vinyl cover was actually more pungent & took longer to air than the mattress itself, despite having already aired it out for 2 days in my car before the mattress arrived. After 3 days passed, all I could smell was the vinyl. Really give things time to fully air out, & know that unlike regularly replacing airbeds, you\'ll only have to do this once. After 4 days, everything was fine.I\'ve slept 2 nights on the new mattress, & one thing I notice is the bed really holds body heat much better than my 18"" airbed, which always remained as warm or cold as the air in the room. Even though my mattress is currently lying on a tile floor, I was quite warm when I woke up, & without needing extra blankets or heating. Outdoor temps are below freezing, so it\'s nice, but when we return to 5 months of temps above 90F, this may be a challenge. This bed also works pretty good for sitting on propped up against pillows with a laptop PC or a book.The best thing I can report is I have not been waking up in pain because of the mattress. It feels totally different to sleep on compared to my airbed, but I wake up feeling pretty good. Overall so far, I am quite happy with this purchase.12/20/11 Update:I love this mattress. My lower back pain has improved dramatically. It has straightened out & aligned the vertebrae in my back like nothing else I\'ve found, except maybe my old semi-waveless water bed. Lying on it also gives the nerve pain in my arm a break. Alleviating chronic FM/arthritis pain helps the pain centers in the brain to shut down, & quit firing...which in turn promotes restorative sleep. This has been like no-hassle physical therapy for my back.Also, unlike airbeds, it is cozy on cold nights. And I no longer fear 3am *deflations*... The chemical odors are long gone. I now ask it, where have you been all my life... lol I am very glad I took the risk & bought one. This bed was a lucky find.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States November 10, 2011', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars EXCELLENT QUALITY! Cheap price but not cheaply made', 'author': 'Sonny Nguyen', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'This review is going to be in-depth, and objective, as well as a little bit of subjective perspective. It will be ongoing, as I will continue to update periodically for the lifetime of the mattress. I\'m doing this for the potential customers, because I would have appreciated If more reviews were more specific, and informative as opposed to just simple comments, hence the word review. I read a lot of Amazon reviews on multiple memory foam mattresses that Amazon had to offer, researched in store, and online prior to purchasing this Best Price Mattress. You spend a 1/3 your life sleeping, so I knew this was a VERY IMPORTANT investment, and wanted to make an informed decision. Also, my spending budget was under $1k, wasn\'t trying to spend up to $1k-4k on a Tempur-Pedic; plus the ones I tried in store weren\'t that magical anyways considering the price. I\'ve read that memory foam mattresses tend to last 5 years on average depending you got a decent purchase. So if this lasted even 3 years that accounts to $100 a year, that would be awesome, who could afford not to make this type of investment.To give you an idea, I\'m a male, 24 years of age, 5\'8"", 165 lbs, no major health issues, illness, or sickness just some occasional neck and back pains. I haven\'t slept well in more than 3 years now, having slept mostly on pillow top spring mattress, futons, and airbeds. I don\'t usually like taking pills or medicine, but have had to resort to taking Melatonin on occasion due to restlessness. I\'m also a very light sleeper (have been for all my life). For instance, I need the room to be pitch dark, no loud, or sudden noises, so I use ear plugs.2/4/2014First off, I ordered this on Sunday, close to midnight, and received it on Tuesday, before noon; via Amazon Prime 2-day Shipping. Shipping was very quick, Amazon is usually very good about getting the product delivered on time, even a day earlier sometimes. Ups delivery man carried the 80 lbs box with the mattress up 3 flights of stairs with a smile. The box itself had minor blemishes as expected, but no major damage, or anything that would have damaged the contents containing the mattress. Inside the box was the mattress rolled up in a thin, transparent vacuumed sealed plastic, within a durable, semi-opaque, white outer plastic bag with a tie string, along with warranty, and instructions.Setup was easy enough for one person. The mattress began to expand immediately, when taking off the vacuum sealed plastic; and within 30 minutes it was already at 9 1/4""H. Ten hours later it has expanded to 9 3/4""H. Dimensions on the mattress are on point, fits on the queen bed frame perfectly. Directions say to allow for 48 hours of uninterrupted expansion for best results. I strongly do not recommend sleeping on the mattress during the allotted expansion time, doing so may have implications such as not fully expanding as per the instructions. I\'m a little OCD, and cautious, so I\'m allowing at least 72 hours for expansion to ensure quality from the very beginning of use. Most of the reviews said that it had a strong chemical odor, and they weren\'t lying it is quite strong, but not enough to give you a headache. It\'s been airing out for 10 hours, the chemical odor is still quite noticeable, and this is with a tall window open and the ceiling fan on high, but again this is to be expected. I took the mattress cover off, and will leave it off for the 72 hours to enable it to expand, and dissipate unhindered, also going to wash it to hopefully lessen, and mask the smell. The white removable cover is thin, lightweight, soft, smooth, surprisingly durable, and seems to be of decent quality; the detail design pattern looks to be little flowers of some sort. Underneath the removable white cover is some type of non-removable beige, mesh cover, not too sure what its purpose is, but if you really needed to you could cut it and remove it I guess. I lied on the bed for a couple minutes when it was initially expanding, and it felt really soft, plushy, not really firm, but supportive if that makes sense.I liked what I felt in the few minutes that I had with the mattress; we\'ll see if it can wow me in the long run though. My only con or gripe about the mattress thus far, would have to be the chemical odor, but again it was to be expected. A friend told me that they actually don\'t compress the bed until it\'s ordered, because if it were compressed for a long time and the chemical dried out, it\'d probably stay compressed to a certain point. I\'m assuming that the chemical helps to compress the foam as well as expand it, a sort of lubricant if you will. Let the chemical run its course, and dissipate, it was implemented for a reason.Additionally I bought a Sleep Innovations Cool Contour Memory Foam Pillow from Amazon coming tomorrow, which I\'m eager to try, should go hand in hand with the bed. Also the frame Sleep Master Platform Metal Bed Frame/Mattress Foundation, Queen was from Amazon too, and arrived before the mattress conveniently; no complaints.I will update when I\'ve slept on the mattress; possibly a video as well.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 5, 2014', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': ""5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing bed, unbeatable price, and LOOK HERE for answers to your ?'s"", 'author': 'A. Hamidi', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I\'ve slept on an old twin spring-based pillowtop for years so this is no doubt an upgrade...but I\'ve owned this bed for over a week now and I still get giddy every time I lay down on it. So much soft, comfortable support it\'s honestly worth more than twice what it costs. My folks own a king size tempurpedic and this mattress is literally JUST as comfortable, not exaggerating in the least. Do not hesitate to purchase this mattress...I genuinely am saddened by the fact that I didn\'t make this purchase years ago. By the way, I am strictly a stomach sleeper...and this bed is stupidly good for that. In fact, it\'s so damn comfortable I\'ve actually been trying out sleeping on my back and sides...and although I end up on my stomach in the morning...I\'ve been able to fall asleep on my back and sides! (Unheard of for me)For those with some common questions I had/encountered before purchasing (Note, this only applies to the queen size...though, I assume all the other sizes are standard and the company knows what it\'s doing):Q: Is the queen size a standard 60 x 80? --- A: Yes. I measured.Q: Does the Best Price New Innovated Box Spring Metal Frame fit this mattress? --- A: Yes, it\'s made for it- perfect fit.Q: Will standard queen sheets fit on this since it\'s only 8"" thick? --- A: Yes they fit...albeit a slight bit loosely. I suggest purchasing some sheet clips to go in the corners of the bed to hold it in place. There\'s some available on Amazon for like $13 that are 5-star rated. Buy them, they are awesome.Q: Does this mattress need a box spring? --- A: No. It would be totally fine laying on the floor, or with the Best Price metal frame mentioned above.Q: Does it have a really horrible chemical foam smell when you open it? --- A: I\'m 26 yrs young and have a pretty keen sense of smell. Honestly, the smell is not nearly as bad as I was expecting based on some reviews. The smell was prominent for only the first 5-10 minutes after opening, and after 24-26 hours of having left the window open and a small fan running it was entirely gone.Q: Is this bed very firm? Some of these reviewers are saying the bed is too firm. --- A: This bed is not ""very firm""...though, it is definitely a strong, supporting and firm foam. For stomach sleepers this is very good because with foam too soft their center of gravity would sag in the center and be bad for the back.

Let me start by telling you why we tried this mattress...We just bought an old 1921 house and needed to get a mattress up the narrow stairway. After many measurements and several visits to various mattress stores, it turned out that a standard king size mattress would not fit up our stairs. Our options were to buy a smaller mattress from a store, hack away at the staircase, or try a king size memory foam mattress.I read many reviews of this particular mattress and saw comments about odor, permanent dents where someone\'s butt was, etc. We decided that for the price, if we got it and it was really bad, we wouldn\'t be out that much money. So we ordered this product.It came a few days earlier than they originally estimated. As others have mentioned, it\'s shipped in a large box. I\'m 59 years old and was able to slide the box around alone. If I remember right, it weighed around 70 pounds. One step at a time, I was able to nudge it up the stairs. The box fit with no problems.I slid it into the bedroom and we opened the box, slid the rolled-up mattress onto the floor, and cut open the final container. We then laid it out on the floor and it slowly began expanding into a real mattress. Our bed frame was shipped via a different method and it actually arrived about an hour after opening the mattress. So while the mattress was expanding, we built the frame and slid the mattress on top. Somewhere I read that you should allow 24 hours for it to fully expand but we actually slept on it after about 9 or 10 hours.I have to say, this is a GREAT mattress product. It\'s just firm enough but not too firm. We had tried around 15 much higher-end mattresses at the stores and were able to get a good feeling of very firm, firm, soft, and very soft. We definitely would not have done well with very firm because we both have bad backs. Firm was closer to what we liked, but we weren\'t sure if this would be good either for our backs. Soft was too soft! We didn\'t want to sink into the bed! Anyway, I would place this mattress between the high, high end of soft and lower end of firm. It feels great!We\'ve had it now for about 2 1/2 months. We see no ""dents"" where we lay. You can sit on the edge with no problem. You don\'t sink in or fall off when sitting on the edge. And when you lay down, you only sink in a few inches. (I\'m guessing down to the bottom foam layer). I think it\'s perfect. It feels better than many of the $1,500-$2,000 ones we tried at the stores!Regarding the initial odor, there was a slight smell to it but not tremendously strong. After a couple minutes, we only noticed it if we left the room and came back in. The smell lasted for probably around 5 or 6 hours. I\'m guessing it\'s just the new foam material smell or maybe something done in packing. But to be clear, it only lasts a few hours.So my wife and I love it! We\'re both in our upper 50s and it seems to have been a great decision. And our backs have no problems with it either.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States March 2, 2015', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Best price mattress 6-in', 'author': 'Annie Dunn', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'This is a very comfortable mattress.

We have used every kind of mattress over the years and memory foam types are the only kind we will use since they are the best for pain relief and comfort. We have this one in queen for our bed. This is by far the best mattress we have ever used and here is why.We looked at memory foam mattresses for days on end after deciding to buy a memory foam mattress. We went to stores and tested everything from Tempurpedic to lesser priced memory foam mattresses and still weren\'t sure which one we should get. I know Temperpedic\'s reputation and love their mattresses but we didn\'t want to shell out 4 to 7 grand for their best mattress so I investigated the science and foam levels of their mattresses at length for days on end for weeks prior to this purchase to find the secret to their mattresses so I could apply that to finding one of equal comfort for a fraction of their prices.I found many other memory foam mattresses here on Amazon and in the stores that boasted about their 3 inch memory foam and 7 inches of base support foam but after close investigation I found that though it sounds great at first all we would really get was 3 inches of memory foam comfort and that to me is no different than a 3 inch memory foam topper. I wanted more comfort than that, and the most inches of memory foam for the price for myself and my family.More memory foam means you will sink in a lot more (less pressure points that you feel) before your body hits the other base foam. As I have back problems and Fibromyalgia (which my mom refers to as the Princess and the Pea Syndrome) I knew we had to have a mattress that would alleviate any and all pressure points such as my hips and knees.The #1 secret most memory foam mattress makers won\'t tell you to look for is the size of the memory foam (top portion), and the super soft foam (middle portion) vs the high density foam base (base foam). Some makers say theirs are the best because of more total mattress inches (14"" 17"" etc) this is not true. Height does not measure how much it will sink in. The key secret is to look for the size in inches of memory foam and to add that to the size of the super soft foam, this is how many inches of pure comfort and sink in you will really get! Temperpedic knows this as their mattress have smaller foam bases and more LAYERS of memory and super soft foams. The foam base is made of a firmer type of foam used as a foundation in much the same way as box springs are to create a firm base, that type of foam does not provide much give and is definitely not something you want to feel while sleeping so keep that in mind. This mattress has 3 inches of memory foam + 2 inches of super soft foam and that gives us 5 inches of LAYER memory and super soft foam comfort. Just what we were looking for!At first look, you may be shocked at how a quality memory foam mattress could live in such a small box, but just give it a day or so to puff back up to its regular size which it does incredibly fast, it took less than 30 mins for ours to reach 8 of it\'s 10 inches. This mattress is compressed tightly for shipping purposes so it will not look fluffy and soft when you first open that box. Wait to open the plastic wrap covering until you get it to the room you want it. Once its opened up, it is very difficult and hard to move around so I suggest placing it on your bed frame or box spring before opening the plastic seal. The rolled up mattress is incredibly heavy, think about getting help with this if you have back problems, and is even harder to move once the plastic wrap is taken off, hence the advice to place it on the bed before unsealing the plastic. We bought a memory foam mattress frame platform bed for our memory foam mattress as well as a Malouf mattress protector. We have added pictures of the box before opening as well as the mattress once it was opened for a few hours above.

Two of them were great! The Twin and the full. Best beds I\'ve slept in. See the full review below. The King however, seems wrong and or defective.(King sized bed review)This mattress was a lemon! The plastic vacuumed sealed bag had a tear in it, since it exposed the mattress, it developed a dirty spot and divet. It expanded unevenly and parts of it on the edges are still not expanded. The bed itself is SUPER soft, I immediately sink in and I feel like I don\'t have any support. It\'s hard to move since it the spot I sleep in remains dipped for a moment so it feels like there is a hole sucking me in if I turn to a different position, very uncomfortable.I bought this brand because the beds are firm, yet soft enough to relive pressure, however, this was not the case with my most recent purchase. Very disappointed. I asked for a refund and I\'m getting rid of the bed.(Original Review) (General Disclaimer): Bed comfortability is a subjective thing! What may be a great fit for me, may not be a great fit for you! Please know that when reviewing a bed and when selecting a bed. Than being said, let\'s get on to the review.(What I came from):I\'ve owned a memory foam mattress for at least 6 years. My old mattress was more on the softer side of things, so much so that whenever I slept on my stomach (rare) I\'d need an extra pillow on my torso for support, otherwise stomach would sink into the bed. After a few years I ended up flipping the mattress and sleeping on the ""hard/support"" foam, which was still soft, but not as soft as the side I was supposed to be sleeping on. My body got used to the soft foam, but I knew I needed firm, yet soft support.(The Review):Enter the ""Best Price Mattress 12-Inch Memory Foam Mattress"" (Full). I was careful when selecting this mattress; I checked the average positive review, made sure that the negative ones weren\'t criticizing for the wrong reasons (e.g. expecting a soft mattress when this one is under the ""firm"" search category), made sure that the positive review mentioned things that I needed (Firm but not hard, supportive yet soft, no pressure points), and this mattress fits the bill!This mattress seems very firm at first, in fact it took my body a day or two to get used to this bed, now, I don\'t want to get up in the morning! It\'s sooo comfy. I woke up this morning and stayed an extra hour and a half in bed because it\'s so comfy lol. But uest it is firm, so it supports your body well, BUT, when you\'re in bed, and your body heat warms the mattress, it quickly softens and molds to your body.I\'m mostly a side sleeper and this mattress does not give me sore shoulders, in fact, I\'ve so far woken up in the same position I\'ve slept in and that\'s RARE for me, so this mattress is very good and eliminating pressure points and supporting your body.(Unboxing): Was pretty painless, although I had to use a knife because when cutting through the tape I accidentally slightly cut the mattress and it expanded slightly. But once I got it out of the box and the bag, it pretty much expanded to its full size almost instantly. That\'s just for me though, so don\'t expect it to expand instantly for you.For me, I can sleep on this bed on all positions, sides and back seem to be best. Keep in mind that all bodies are different and for me, this works perfectly. If any of what you read is what you\'re looking for in a bed, please, feel free to purchase this mattress.My Body type: Male, \'5 ""10, 230Lbs,', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 28, 2018', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars It’s a bed', 'author': 'VWilliams', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'So I got the 6 inch for my daughters full sized bed.

Memory foam beds are designed to be used without a box spring. We still had our old temper-pedic box spring on the bed. So, we switched that out for a 14 in metal king bed frame and poof, magic, soft bed. I felt the difference immediately. I absolutely love this bed now. I look forward to getting in it.

To be clear, this mattress was intended to replace a junk, coil spring mattress in my part time residence, where I wanted to maximize my comfort (and reduce pain) at a price point that made sense. Coming in at just around $300, I figured I had little to lose and, at worst, it would have to be a step above the old mattress. Imagine my utterly pleasant surprise to come and find out that this little gem not only met that low bar, but overwhelmingly exceeded it. I\'ve had this mattress for a little over a month and have slept on it probably near three weeks out of that month. In that time what I have found is that this mattress is extremely comfortable, super easy to set up and provides just the right amount of support where I need it most. In fact, I would say that it almost.....almost provides the same comfort level and support factor as my sleep number mattress. Almost, but not quite.Pros:1. Extremely convenient packaging and set up: A queen size mattress in a box, delivered to my doorstep. How easy is that? The box itself is hefty so you likely will need a helper to get the whole deal into position and especially when it comes time to cut the packaging and have it ready to go ""inflation"". Instructions provided and easy to follow. Once we properly positioned the wrapped mattress on the box spring it took a simple slice of the plastic (using the slicer provided to us in the box) and voila! new mattress. The directions tell you to allow the mattress to shape for at least 72 hours, but I was extremely hopeful that I would be able to us it that night as one more night on the old mattress was absolutely out of the question. Some people have noted that their mattresses didn\'t form properly or didn\'t reach the intended height (some even after the 72 hours) but I found that my mattress was fully formed and at the right height in no more than 12 hours. I made the choice to use it that night2 Comfort: I\'ve found over the years that I need a firmer mattress to alleviate much of my lower pack pain and stiffness that I\'ve found in using mattresses of lesser quality. The one advantage of a sleep number bed is that you have 100s of different combinations available to you to find just the right amount of firmness or softness to achieve maximum comfort, and over the past year or so that I\'ve owned it, I\'ve found that I fall neatly within the medium firmness category (for those familiar with sleep number, I\'m about a 55 to 60 setting) so having this mattresses advertised as falling into the medium to firm category was really important - and I was counting on that description being accurate. And I can tell you that , at least in my experience - it is. In fact, if I had to assign a sleep number to this mattress for comparison, my guess is that it would fall in the 65-70 range. I say this because while extremely comfortable, it does seem to be just a bit firmer than my current sleep number setting. Not enough that it creates any moderate discomfort, but just enough that I can feel the pressure. For reference - I am in the range of 180-190lbs - I can\'t speak to how well that level of firmness holds for someone in a different weight bracket, but my best guess is that it will hold relatively stable for most people.3 Sturdy - I can\'t speak to how other foam mattresses are in this category, but when sleeping with someone else, I don\'t feel them moving or turning/tossing.4 Price - Sure, you can invest in other, more expensive mattresses, foam or otherwise, for your needs, but out of the box, at this price point, you get a lot of mattress with very little downside. That being said, I cannot speak to how well it will hold up over the long term, or whether it will still be the same mattress in 1 year or even 3, but at this price point, I would be satisfied with with a handful of good quality years.Cons - Really very few to mention, but:1 Edge support - I believe this is an issue with every foam mattress, but the edge support is absolutely not on par with a traditional mattress. That being said, it does not affect my use of the mattress one bit, but for those that need the extra support to get out of bed, or, for those that want to utilize some edge support for ""extracurricular"" activities - you\'ll find that you\'ll have to adjust for the lack of edge support and plan accordingly.2 Cooling - foam mattresses in general are notorious for running warm and while this mattress attempts to compensate for it by using a cooling layer, I believe that warm sleepers are still going to find themselves sleeping warm. I generally don\'t tend to be a warm sleeper, so it hasn\'t been an issue for me, but it also certainly doesn\'t offer any more cooling features than any other mattress available.All in all, I rate this mattress very highly and certainly would recommend purchasing it assuming its specifications meet your needs.

I was looking for something like a Casper mattress, but didn't really want to spend $800 on a mattress if I didn't have to. I started looking on Amazon to see the mattresses available, and found Novilla. Initially the price drew me in, but the reviews made me make the purchase. I saw how many people enjoyed the mattress on multiple websites and figured it was worth the shot. It looked like a similar version to Casper and Novilla was less than half the price.Mattress came in great condition, and I let the mattress inflate to size for 2 days before sleeping on it. It grew to the full 12 inches and looks great. The first night I was hot, but I just moved into a new apartment and am figuring out the heating and believe this is why. The second night was a deep and solid sleep, and I think the mattress is extremely comfy. It's somewhat firm (probably medium-firm?) but the foam adjusts to your weight and supports you nicely.

I hemmed and hawed and read too many reviews, plus, asked around about these over the past couple of years to have a bit of an understanding and expectation of how these actually work before I finally ordered this well made one made by Dourxi.I was able to order ahead of time and lucky enough to let it expand for the Dourxi recommended,FULL THREE days, before trying it out.With that said, this is a VERY well made mattress from a box in my opinion! And, I would purchase Dourxi again based on my excellent sleep experience with this mattress.This is also well sewn with quality seams and trim.The casing is soft to touch but my mattress protector and sheets completely encase the beautiful material and trim so I don\'t understand why people talk about that.There was NO odor or ANY chemical smell that released from it at ALL.The box says \'natural and organic\', but I don\'t really know if that is true or not. What I do know is that it hasn\'t caused me any headaches, back, hips, or lupus flare ups.So far, my experience is it\'s very comfortable sleeping on it.I ordered the plush medium soft and it\'s exactly what I wanted.I do not like firm, hard, or full sinking into, memory foam mattresses.

For now ill give a 3 star until I know how it feels to sleep on it.Update: just about 2 weeks into sleeping on this mattress. So far I’ve noticed that although the edges did firm up just a bit they are still not supportive and you absolutely will slide right off the side. It is not plush in my personal opinion and a little more firm than I expected but hopefully with time and the addition of a pillow topper it will soften. This bed sleeps really hot, but it’s not a big deal to me as I keep my room chilly but if your a hot sleeper this might not be for you.

He has a smaller closet, and the way it’s packaged makes it totally feasible to stand in a back corner until you’re ready to open it. As it turns out, he was excited and ready to open it now. Oof.Fast forward 10 days, after I’ve ordered the up-sized bed frame and mattress protector (I’d already bought the sheets, pillows, and comforter set) and arranged to borrow the neighbor’s guest bedroom so the mattress had a flat place to lay undisturbed for three days, and now he’s lodged a complaint that this new bed is too comfortable and he’s struggling to make himself get out of it for his 9 a.m. class.Our experience was kind of an obstacle course, but here’s what you need to know:• The package is heavier than it looks. Proceed accordingly.• Don’t open the plastic vacuum wrap until you’ve got a flat surface this can lay on for a few days to fully re-inflate.• We didn’t notice any strong odors after opening.• It expands rapidly when you open the plastic. Like… RoadRunner cartoon rapidly. Proceed accordingly.• Standard full-size sheets and mattress protectors accommodate it just fine.• It’s more plush than we expected, but still has minimal motion transfer.• It really does stay cool. My kid sleeps hot and even after sleeping on it for 8 hours, he’s still comfortable when he wakes up.• We have it on a bed frame with closely-spaced metal slats and no box spring, and it’s still fully supportive. I’ll add a board to extend the life of the mattress, but it’s comfortable without either.• I had also planned to add a 3” mattress topper to this when I bought it, to further extend the life of the mattress. I’m still going to do that, but for comfort and cooling, it’s not necessary.• It’s too soft for me, but I have a long-standing angry hip flexor condition that demands a bed only slightly softer than a sheet of plywood.Overall, we are super impressed with this mattress; both at the sale price AND the regular price and we recommend it.

It’s been about a month now and the edges never expanded to the full 10inches.

I’m rather short and it’s just me on the bed so it being smaller doesn’t bother me too much but it’s annoying that the bed is too small for my frame (which wasn’t an issue with my old full mattress) and my sheets looks really baggy which irks me.The only other issue I have with the bed is how you can feel the springs from the side of mattress.

After one night on our new Gojef hybrid mattress, we're very pleased with the comfort and quality of our sleep.This mattress is medium firm. Plenty of softness while providing ample support that isn't hard to roll out of when you're getting out of bed. The side walls feel sturdy and firm. No excessive bounce from the springs. The Queen size does a good job of filling most of the space between our headboard and foot board, unlike the previous mattress. No more gap at the head of the bed that swallows remotes and pillows and our fitted sheets fit much better as well.The mattress arrived vacuum sealed, rolled up in a long cardboard box. It's not terribly heavy for most but may require two people to lift, as it is a bit awkward. Unpacking was easy. Simply tear off the box, unroll the plastic, cut the vacuum sealed bag with the included blade cutter and watch your mattress inflate to full size in seconds.We opened our mattress around 2 pm and it was ready to sleep on within minutes, though we waited until our usual bedtime. I didn't notice even the slightest odor or any off-gassing whatsoever. We both had a deeper sleep with less wakeups through the night and no stiff or tingling arms or hips for me.

In fact I have never owned a foam type bed in a box mattress before. Instead usually buying standard type mattresses over the years. I have owned Sealy, Serta, Beauty Rest, and Stern and Foster over the years. Ever since mattresses have changed to a no turn type mattress they seem to have less and less durability and longevity to them but the price has either stayed the same or increased. So it was interesting to see how a memory foam bed in a box mattress would compare to these.So first let me say I'm impressed so far. I have slept on this mattress for a total of 4 nights and so far I really like it. I have noticed it sleeps cooler than other mattresses I have owned which I love since I usually sleep very hot. When first laying on it it seemed it might be too firm since it is a medium firm mattress, and I thought this might be a problem. However after a min or two you actually conform into the foam so to speak and it feels really nice. I also know from research that the firmness of the foam will change overtime so it will get softer with age which is perfect, and I also will be using a pillowtop topper with it as well.Secondly I was expecting there to be a smell and I would have to let the mattress/foam out gas for a while before being able to actually sleep on this. This was not the case when I unpackaged it there was absolutely no smell whatsoever. I also followed the online directions of letting it sit for 48 to 72 hours before sleeping on it. Even though the box it came in only specified 24 hours.As far as construction goes. From what I can see on the outside it is well made and looks just like a traditional mattress. There are absolutely no areas of concern that I see with the quality of stitching or anything for that matter.Overall I would say compared to other mattresses this is a great value, is well constructed, and very comfortable. I also have to say I will definitely be purchasing another foam bed in a box type mattress in the future if this one holds up for the same amount of time as a traditional mattress.

The build quality and luxurious materials used are high grade. Overall, the Sapira is a class act.Day 1: The mattress arrives in a tall square-box, about 2x2x4. I attached a photo of what the mattress looks like compressed inside the box. Upon placing the mattress on my boxspring, I cut the plastic off and the bed immediately sprung to life, literally, as the coils decompressed. Yes, there is a noticeable off-gassing smell, but it\'s not offensive. I left my window open at night, and 90% of the smell was gone by the next morning.Day 2: At first, the mattress was a bit firm, but after about 24-36 hours the mattress had fully decompressed and was much more comfortable. It\'s probably a 6.5/7 out of 10 on the firmness scale, the way most online professional mattress websites suggest. The top Avena foam layer sleeps cool, so I don\'t overheat. The bounce the Avena foam + the pocketed coils provide makes moving around, and getting out of bed effortless. The off-gassing smell is just about gone now.Day 3: Decided to get rid of my old mattress and keep the Sapira. I sleep mostly on my back, but sometimes on my side and stomach throughout the night. The only sleep position I thought wasn\'t going to work out was the side position, because of the firmness, but the 3 inches of Avena + memory foam actually provide just enough sinkage, while keeping my spine aligned. The off-gassing smell is completely gone now. I bought a mattress protector, and then my bed sheet goes over that to complete the package.When I bought this mattress last Sunday, there were 20 left in stock with Amazon. As of this morning, only 9 Queen-size beds were left in stock, while some sizes other than Queen were already out of stock. So clearly word is getting out about this mattress. At $1,325, it\'s also a lot less expensive than every other hybrid mattress on the market, most of which will cost at least $2,000 more than this one, and will require you going to a showroom, and taking time off work to be home for delivery.In conclusion, I highly recommend this mattress. Please feel free to ask me any direct questions on here. Also, if you have time, I recommend reading the review on Sleepopolis, as it\'s the most comprehensive professional review that matches my own experience.Update: although I bought a Claritin mattress protector, and although when I called Sapira customer service they recommended having one too, I removed it on Day 4. It added a ""plastic"" feel to the surface of the bed that became unbearable. Once I removed it, that initial softness I experienced on Day 1 came back again. I only intend to use just my bedsheet from here on out. I recommend you do the same.((On a side note, I suggest ignoring the only other two reviews on here, both two stars. Unlike myself, neither one is a confirmed buyer of this product. The first review is too short to be real for a legitimate mattress evaluation by an actual customer. The fact that this mattress has the firmness rating it does shows the Sapira is designed for superior back support, so the reviewer\'s complaint is illogical. The second review is also partially off topic, as they discuss the manufacturers\'s website, which has nothing to do with how the mattress feels. Yes, they are correct the mattress is a little firm, but every other online review already confirms this. So to slam the product with only two stars for performing how it was designed is unfair.))', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 2, 2017', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars good quality and definitely med firm', 'author': 'KC', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I've slept on this mattress now for a week and am very pleased with its level of firmness.

The nice part about the Leesa is the memory foam top, so you get a softer feel while still enjoying a medium firm mattress.

Some reviews say this mattress is too firm, but I found it too soft. Lying on my back, I could feel my butt sink down into the foam a good 3 inches; lying on my side, my hips would also sink down that far, pulling my spine out of alignment. Yes, the memory foam ""bounced"" back to normal once I got up, but that didn\'t help while I was lying down! Also, as someone used to moving around easily on an inner spring, moving around on this mattress also created pain in my back and sides since the memory foam basically ""immobilizes"" you.To Amazon\'s credit, they issued a full refund when I requested it, efficiently and quickly without making me go through a lot of paperwork or red tape.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 16, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '2.0 out of 5 stars Arrived mishappen.', 'author': 'Kathleen M.

I must of looked at 15 different mattresses before deciding to buy this Novilla. I ordered the mattress on the 3rd and UPS delivered it on the 5th. In the tracking info it said it weighed 88lbs, but this definitely felt like it was over 100lbs. I had a Serta mattress before this and this mattress felt much heavier!Novilla included a manual and a tool to open the vacuum sealed plastic without running the risk of cutting the mattress itself. As soon as the plastic was pierced it started to make a hissing noise. Once I cut it open all the way the mattress just popped completely open. It did open upside down though so just be mindful. Also, be careful because it can unfold quick.Once open it expanded to full size. The photo below of the mattress opened was taken 10 minutes after removing it from the plastic! My wife and I left it for 4 hours without laying on it, but I don’t think it needed any more then 30 minutes!*As of right now, it’s 9:10PM on the 7th so tonight will be the 3rd night we sleep on it. It’s make no noise, it’s more on the firm side for us, and it feel so much better then the Serta we had!! My wife is about 120lbs and I’m around 195lbs. I know depending on your weight it might feel softer or firmer.I hope this review helps someone who is considering this mattress! If I didn’t already know and had to guess the price, I’d say it’s in the range of $800-$1200. So if you’re thinking about making the purchase and you like a slightly firmer mattress that’s quiet and really comfortable, look no further!I’ll be sure to update this review in the next 2-4 weeks to let y’all know how it’s going.**1 week update 08/12/23I know it’s only been a week, so I don’t have too much to say. It’s holding up great and still feels the same as the day we received it. It has no noise issues, no sinking issues, it’s still very comfortable! The only con I can say about it is it’s just a tiny bit larger then a traditional queen mattress. Each side hangs off the frame by about 1 inch. That’s just me nitpicking though because it’s not a problem whatsoever. Anywho, I hope this review helps someone with their purchase, I’ll check back in at the 1 month mark.***2 months & 2 weeks later! 10/19/232 months with the new mattress and it’s still like brand new! No sinking or anything. I wouldn’t guess this mattress was so cheap if I didn’t already know. 3rd photo posted is from the 2 month mark.**it’s now October 19th and still, the mattress feels brand new! I’ve been rotating it every 2 weeks when the sheets get washed. It’s more broken in now so it might of just gotten a tad softer, but not in a bad way. even a $3,000 mattress will break in after a bit of use. There’s no sagging or anything! It still looks brand new when the the sheets and mattress protector are off of it. I recommend this bed to everyone!

It\'s not terrible, and is better then what I have used recently, but it may go back. And yes, it sleeps hot.I have been somewhat on a mattress sojourn the last 2 years after a decade old tempurpedic became too uncomfortable. The first 8-9 years with the Tempur were good, but I sleep hot, and vowed to move to something that had more air flow/didn\'t trap heat. I started with a bed in a box mattress that was great the first 30 days, painful the next 30 days, and returned shortly after. After that, I bought a cheap Ikea mattress after spending an afternoon at the store trying every one they had. I thought I had hit a home run - it was cheap, the one in the store was super comfortable, and it was a spring mattress so it would be cool. 90 days later my back was sore, my sleep was terrible, and I wanted to burn it.I had happend to travel for work, and stayed in a hotel where I got three nights of amazing sleep. I called the hotel and asked what mattress set up they had - and bought the retail version of it. But apparently something got lost in translation between the hotel version and the home version or my body rejected it after 90 days, but it too ended up being uncomfortable.So I finally gave up and decided I would get another memory foam mattress and deal with the sleeping hot with either highly breathable sheets/blankets or a fan. I did some research and after reading a gazillion reviews on the myriad of memory foam beds out there, I went relatively cheap based on the good reviews on Amazon for this mattress. My general thought was - it sounds as good as any of the others and is cheaper, and it\'s through Amazon.And.... it\'s OK.The big issue, in my opinion, is Amazon doesn\'t say what the foam density is. It says it\'s a medium firmness mattress which is highly subjective. As I understand it, there are different densities for memory foam. For instance, a soft memory foam can support 2.5 lbs per square inch, a firmer one 5 lbs per square Inch. I would guess this one is on the softer side because rather than cradle you like the old Tempur did, I kind of sink through and end up on the very firm support layers. If you have a softer memory foam, you probably need more than 2"" of it. Denser ones probably work fine at 2"".What this means for sleep - sleep is just OK on this mattress, not great. Some days I wake up with similar back pain as I did on other mattresses. Some days I sleep decent. This is a better mattress than the last three I have tried as I can get more than 6 hours of sleep on it before my body completely rebels, but it sleeps hot and I still wake up with aches. I will give it another 30 days or so to see if my body gets used to it, but I am starting to lean towards returning it.Rating mattresses is of course a very personal thing. We are all different. My recommendation on this mattress would be to pass on it, and find one that either had 3"" of memory foam or denser memory foam so you get the true cradle effect memory foam is known for.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 12, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Amazon Basic Memory Foam Mattress', 'author': 'Amazon Customer', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I purchased a memory foam pillow a decade ago. The smell was so horrible that I banished it to the garage. Weeks later the smell was still so strong and offensive that I threw the pillow away.That experience made me very hesitant about purchasing a memory foam mattress, but a close relative assured me that she had experienced no odor when she purchased her memory foam mattress. After talking with her and reading numerous reviews, I made the decision to purchase the mattress above. I offer the following comments to help others decide if they want to try a memory foam mattress.1) Prepare for the EXPANSION EVENT.A memory foam mattress comes in a box and is rolled tightly in plastic. As you unroll the plastic, physics takes over and the mattress starts a growth process you cannot stop.My husband removed the box, stood the mattress up on one end and began unrolling the outer plastic wrapping as I rolled up the plastic he was removing from the mattress. We had cleared a twin size area on the floor. The mattress immediately started expanding and it was necessary to lay it on the floor before we could cut off the heavy plastic bag in which the mattress was sealed under the outer plastic wrapping. Once all the plastic was removed, we left the mattress on the floor for two days to firm up. The third day my husband carried the mattress to its bed frame, where it continued to firm up. Moving the mattress was challenging because the expanded mattress is very wobbly and difficult to handle. We would have needed a second or third person if the mattress had been a larger size. Consider letting the mattress expand on the bed frame so moving it is not necessary.2) PlasticThere is a lot of heavy plastic to dispose of. Find a store or recycling center.3) Waterproof Mattress ProtectorIt is essential to have a waterproof mattress protector and our mattress did not come with one. The mattress is a foam product and anything you spill on it - food, blood, urine, vomit - will stain the foam and is likely to create permanent smells. Amazon has a good selection of waterproof mattress protectors.4) Memory Foam OdorOur mattress had no odor.5) Corners Not ExpandingSome reviewers mention corners that did not fully expand. Our corners expanded fully once the inner bag was removed from the mattress.6) FirmnessHow firm do you want your mattress? After reviews and recommendations, we decided on Amazon\'s medium firm, 10 inch mattress. It is comfortable, and does not ""trap"" you in the foam as some reviewers said could happen with softer mattresses.7) HeatConsider this issue carefully based on your preferences. As you lay on a memory foam mattress you will feel a warmth. This gentle warmth is comfortable and relaxing, and is one reason I would choose a memory foam mattress again. Removing or adding a blanket can help control the heat level.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 27, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars So comfortable and affordable.', 'author': 'Violet', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I had my previous mattress for over five years.

I will say that I don\'t have to drag myself out of bed anymore. My lower back is not crippling me after being in bed all night. The bed is just firm enough to keep you from sinking into it.

This mattress isn\'t too firm though. I don\'t feel like I\'m sleeping on a covered rock.I noticed in some reviews people thought the mattress had a smell at first. My husband unpacked the mattress as soon as we got it. I was thinking, ""My queen size mattress is in THAT box?"" I knew how they were shipped, but seeing it in that box was crazy! He got it out and opened it up, so it could puff back up, and left it for a few hours before looking at it again. It didn\'t take much time for it to reach it\'s full thickness. We slept on it that night with no smell of any kind whatsoever.We both are satisfied with our purchase. We never expected it to take away all of our back problems. It\'s a mattress, not a miracle. Our expectations were met and we sleep as comfortable as possible considering.My advice to you is not to think any memory foam mattress will solve all of your sleep issues.

I will come back if I find something to knock back a star.First off, I did a LOT of homework before ordering this mattress. I read tons of reviews and as many independent reviews as I could find. A couple of conclusions lead me in this direction. 1. Trying out a bed in a store as apposed to buying on line did not lead to a higher satisfaction rate. 2. Spending a lot of money on a mattress also did not appear to increase satisfaction.So my starting point... I have a lovely antique butterprint bed that is 3/4 sized that I wanted to keep. I had been sleeping on a (very old) mattress on top of a (very older) box spring with a one inch memory foam topper. I was reasonably comfortable curled up in my divit that had formed; I like a soft bed and this fit that bill along with significant amount of hammocking; then came the boyfriend. While he never complained about the bed, when I mentioned I had intended to replace it for years the truth that my mattress bothered his back and the amount of hammocking was extreme for him was a tipping point. Then came the flurry of activity. Research and shopping for me and removing the old box spring and creating a platform bed out of my antique bed for him.He likes a very firm bed and I a soft bed. (My hips don\'t like pressure points!) I decided to shoot for a mattress firmer than what I thought would be comfortable for me and add toppers as needed. I could always make it softer, but never make it firmer. My research led me to several beds in the $600 to $800 range that sounded like good bets. But then there is the 3/4 size antique bed that is only 75 inches long. Zinus sells a short queen! I bit the bullet and hit the order button.We are both very comfortable! I did keep my one inch topper that seems to work for both of us. In fact we find it as comfortable as the $2000 mattress at his house! It is a lovely balance between enough ""mush"" for my hips and firmness for his back. In fact I am liking the firmness under the ""mush"" more than I would have thought.

In fact I have never owned a foam type bed in a box mattress before. Instead usually buying standard type mattresses over the years. I have owned Sealy, Serta, Beauty Rest, and Stern and Foster over the years. Ever since mattresses have changed to a no turn type mattress they seem to have less and less durability and longevity to them but the price has either stayed the same or increased. So it was interesting to see how a memory foam bed in a box mattress would compare to these.So first let me say I'm impressed so far. I have slept on this mattress for a total of 4 nights and so far I really like it. I have noticed it sleeps cooler than other mattresses I have owned which I love since I usually sleep very hot. When first laying on it it seemed it might be too firm since it is a medium firm mattress, and I thought this might be a problem. However after a min or two you actually conform into the foam so to speak and it feels really nice. I also know from research that the firmness of the foam will change overtime so it will get softer with age which is perfect, and I also will be using a pillowtop topper with it as well.Secondly I was expecting there to be a smell and I would have to let the mattress/foam out gas for a while before being able to actually sleep on this. This was not the case when I unpackaged it there was absolutely no smell whatsoever. I also followed the online directions of letting it sit for 48 to 72 hours before sleeping on it. Even though the box it came in only specified 24 hours.As far as construction goes. From what I can see on the outside it is well made and looks just like a traditional mattress. There are absolutely no areas of concern that I see with the quality of stitching or anything for that matter.Overall I would say compared to other mattresses this is a great value, is well constructed, and very comfortable. I also have to say I will definitely be purchasing another foam bed in a box type mattress in the future if this one holds up for the same amount of time as a traditional mattress.

Dry and comfortable all night.For my weight, this mattress is great in any sleep position: side, stomach and back all feel natural. It has just enough sink so that my behind is flush with my spine if I’m on my back, which no mattress has ever managed to do for me before. If you’re on the lighter side, this might not be the same for you, but again, just speaking for my own size.The quilted top doesn’t have large divots like some mattresses, and the top layer of foam is just thick enough to feel plush without the marshmallow/quicksand feel of the Zinus memory foam mattresses. Great edge support too - sleeping on my side it felt stable right up to the edge.

I call back and said I just want to talk about mattresses, and the robot says ""Sorry, I can\'t help you with that"" and again immediately hung up, etc. So, after saying, ""Buy a mattress"" repeatedly, I finally reached a person to inquire about the warranty:The Bottom Line: The decision to issue a replacement mattress will be made by sending Zinus a picture of the mattress taken with no sheet or object on the bed. If an observable 1.5 inch sag can be noted, then they will issue a replacement, which takes a week. (Note: They pointedly have no interest in my actual experience with the bed, and or any pictures of me actually in the quicksand mattress of death.) However, Zinus has no pickup service for the old mattress, so the responsibility to dispose of the giant CalKing- sized piece of used bubble gum is mine. So, while the prospect of getting a replacement terrible-quality mattress from Zinus and the joy of watching their delivery workers simply walk away from my current La Brea Tar Pit-style mattress because ""they don\'t do that"" is tempting...In closing, I shared my unique view with Zinus customer service that if a company saddles a customer with a (unwieldy, impossible to carry) lemon, they should recognize the significant imposition on that customer and take steps to make it right. Zinus thanked me for this new, deep insight that I provided to them and promised that they would consider it, so that perhaps in the future some other person who absolutely wastes their money on a Zinus product will no longer be burdened with how to dispose of said item.

The reinforced several inches near the edges feel like sleeping on the floor, although they do provide the advertised non-collapsing edges. For a couple who might be making use of those edge areas it\'s not going to be terribly comfortable.Despite too-firm edges, the corners are soft and feel like they never fully expanded. They slope in as if belonging to a different mattress-- although that does mean fitted sheets are easy-on/easy-off.The 13"" height is a good intermediate one -- any thinner is guaranteed uncomfortable for adults and will come in too low versus traditional bedside tables.

It didn\'t expand to even half its size and it was incredibly uncomfortable. Amazon Customer Service was AMAZING, so though we were frustrated with the fact that the mattress didn\'t work out, dealing with returning/refunds and all that was a breeze.Fast forward to last week, and my boyfriend and I are researching mattresses like we\'re becoming experts in the field. I\'d looked into the other one we got fairly well, it had over 90% 5-star ratings, but it was awful. We had our old queen mattress stacked on top of our new king frame, and we were staying up until 10 or 11 at night just researching mattresses. I didn\'t know what reviews to trust because so many brands had a high number of five star reviews, but the same was true for the first mattress we bought and it turned out to be a mistake.We decided we\'d try one more time, and then if we ran into similar issues, we\'d just deal with that mattress until COVID restricts were lessened/lifted and we felt comfortable going directly to a mattress store and buying something direct. We searched for hours, read articles, read reviews both on and off Amazon, did BBB searches and got word of mouth reviews, and everything led us back to Casper as a potentially trustworthy brand to invest in.So we gave it a shot.Our mattress arrived today, and though we haven\'t slept on it yet, we\'re already much happier with what we received. Within minutes of unpacking it, it\'d already expanded to about 8/10 inches, and now it\'s sitting at just shy of the 10, only a few hours after unpacking. I\'ve seen people complaining about the mattress being lopsided, curved corners, not expanding, etc. and we haven\'t had ANY of those issues.I laid on it for a little bit just to see how it felt and it\'s heavenly. It springs back and has got give, but it\'s not too soft. I would say that ""medium firm"" is a good description for this bed. Not too soft/hard in my opinion. I know people report that it\'s comfy at first, but gets worse so I\'m planning to update my review in a month or two with an update to see if the same happens to us.Now, the smell.This is where you can believe what you read, this bed does come with a pretty bad off gassing smell. I was able to smell it just as my bf brought it up the stairs, and he hadn\'t even removed it from the bag yet. Once he pulled it off, the smell got noticeably worse and we were able to smell it from my office which is kiddy-corner to our bedroom. We opened the bedroom window in order to help air it out some. I will say this, it isn\'t a rancid smell, like something you can\'t be around, it\'s just not a great smell. It puts me in the mind of the back corner of a warehouse or a dank basement where all the stuff is shoved that no one has touched in MONTHS. It\'s strong, but it comes and goes, and like I said, it\'s not like smelling trash or sewage backup or something that would make your stomach turn, it\'s just unpleasant. I sprayed some smell good stuff in the hallway outside my office and I can barely smell it now. If you have a candle or incense or something, plan to use it if you sit close to this bed. The weird thing is, when I went and actually laid on the bed, I couldn\'t really smell it a whole lot. It\'s definitely going away, but it is pretty bad out of the box.I\'m prepared to upgrade this review from four to five stars if I find that it A. remains comfortable. B. the smell goes away, and C. expands this last inch to get to its full height. My hope is that I will be diligent enough to update this review in a month or two and then again in six to eight months with how its holding up. I know mattresses are supposed to last much longer, but if we can just get a good year out of it until we can actually go and test some mattresses in person (and maybe spend a little more on a really good one), I\'ll be happy.

We were super leery to purchase a mattress online without laying on it and for such a low price. However our daughter doesn’t weigh much so it seemed low risk to try one. I will say I was shocked at how heavy the mattress is and really had to wrestle it out of the packaging & onto my daughter’s new bed. It took very little time to fully “inflate” from being rolled into a log for shipping. I would call this a true medium soft mattress with a little bounce to it. It’s definitely not firm, definitely not too soft so as to let your lower back sway into an unhealthy position. It’s the perfect amount of support mixed with enough softness. It’s not a memory foam sinking feeling, just soft with a small bounce. After tons of research I might even consider this for our queen mattress replacement when our pure memory foam wears out. I realize now that memory foam alone is too hot no matter what they call it or claim it’s made from. It’s hot! This being a hybrid seems different so the inner springs must help dissipate heat compared to a 100% memory foam type.

Let\'s face it, you probably wouldn\'t have high expectations for a mattress that costs less than $200, right?Here\'s the deal: cash is tight. I\'ve gone back to school and so I\'ve got to be scrappy and pinch every penny I have. So when it became painfully clear (literal pain in my back!) that my old mattress needed to be replaced, I went on an exhaustive search for options - and ""exhaustive"" is no exaggeration. Here are the criteria I used:1) Has to be a bed in a box - didn\'t want to pay delivery/setup fee and didn\'t want weird strangers tromping around my bedroom2) Has to be less than $5003) Has to be a spring/foam hybrid4) Has to be a size/weight I can manage myself (I am a 42-year-old woman of slightly higher than average physical fitness)If you look around Amazon, you will see that there are a LOT of mattresses that fall under those criteria, so I had to narrow it down. This is where I really need to thank my fellow Amazon consumers for their thoughtful, detailed reviews, because it made my task a lot easier. So.. thanks! :) I will attempt now to do the same.The bed arrived four days early, which was a nice surprise. I came home, and the box was laying on my front patio. I think the UPS person must have struggled with it, because one of the flaps on the end was missing/ripped off. If I had one critique, that would be it: the box this thing ships in would be lots easier to manage if it had handles of some sort. Lacking handles, it\'s pretty unwieldy. As it is, I\'m a pretty crafty gal, so I flipped the box end-over-end through my front door, through the foyer, and up my stairs (three sets total, two landings) to my bedroom. (An aside: I lift weights. Heavy ones. Regularly. It\'s good for you, and you should do it, too, so you can heft heavy mattresses around by yourself without injury.)Getting the mattress to metamorphose from its brilliantly vac-wrapped sausage form to its final flat mattress state was a bit of a trick. The mattress is wrapped in a few layers of thick plastic; included with the mattress is a handydandy thing that looks just like the letter opener on my desk at work. I helped myself to it, and I guess maybe I accidentally poked a hole in the innermost plastic layer as I was cutting the plastic, because the mattress started to expand before I was ready for it! I could hear the air hiss as it was being sucked into the package, so I hurried to finish removing the plastic. The mattress unfurled, and I watched as the product of modern technology unfolded before my eyes.In the span of about ten minutes, the mattress had expanded to near-full capacity. I was shocked! I was also mightily curious about what it felt like. So - I laid down on it for a brief minute... just to see. It was GLORIOUS. It had give while still being supportive. It squished, but the springs have just the right amount of pushback. I was excited! :) BUT - I also am good at delaying gratification, so - per directions - I let the mattress sit for 24 hours to finish any additional expansion. I\'m not real sure if it did, to be honest - It really looked to me like it expanded to full size easily within one hour - but I didn\'t want to mess anything up by not following directions.I\'ve slept on the mattress a few days now, and I can say that this is, without a doubt, the most comfortable mattress I have ever owned. It is perfect for me - it\'s firm, but it has give, so even sleeping on my side is comfortable. It\'s also very well made; all the ticking and the stitching is straight, well-done, and solid.I will, of course, update my review if, over the course of time, something goes awry... but for now, I am a very happy and satisfied customer, and I would highly recommend this mattress to anyone looking for quality and comfort on a budget. Shoot, even if it only lasts for a few years, at $200, I\'m still ahead of the game!', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 10, 2018', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing, amazing mattress', 'author': 'Tom  Whit', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Where do I start...Ok, right here, Freaking AWESOME mattress. I searched Amazon for mattresses for my camp cabin, and read quite a few reviews on different seller\'s mattresses and ultimately settled on this one, and glad I did. Let me start by saying, I was somewhat skeptical when I read the part, "" this mattress comes rolled up in a cardboard box"" which to me defy\'s all logics and physics, especially noting the mattress is over 9"" thick and had metal coil springs. I\'m thinking this could be the 8th wunder of the world. So I ordered it. Let me say that about 10 yrs ago I bought one of those new style pillow top King size BRAND name mattress from a major mattress store here locally, and I paid over $1200.00 for it. It was a total waste of money and piece of junk. The mattress dipped so much in the middle, hip area, I could have used it for a Chinese Wok. Never one night of good sleep, ever. Just pain, aches , duscomfort, etc for both me and my wife. Naturally store would not refund our money or even swap for another. So now for my cabin. Deciding to build a set of bunk beds and knowing dimensions of this Twin XL, I got to work while mattress was in shipment. I had lumber dry stacked from Amish sawmill, cut all my lumber to size, ran it thru planer, sanded it, and put it together. The mattress arrived in the cardboard box about 44"" tall by about 14""x14"", and I was still scratching my head, thinking there is a Twin XL mattress inside here....okayyyyy. Removed from the box, and that rolled up mattress was about 12"" in diameter. Still thinking , no way. So I laid the coil on the bunk bed base, removed the endless plastic wrap that encased the mattress to prevent it from uncoiling like a cobra snake. Now I could see the white mattress all coiled up in yet was it\'s final vacuum wrap. Now I\'m thinking what wall am I going to end up getting tossed against when I break the vacuum seal on this puppy. I carefully broke the seal cutting a four inch piece off of the corner and watched the magic happen. That thing sucking air to expand sounded like a small jet engine. Took about I\'d say a couple minutes and that think was full size as pictured. My first thought was I\'m really impressed, my second thought , I guess I\'m keeping this, because there is no way in hell this is going back in that box. The only comparison and amazement I can say is that this is like when you see a model sailing clipper ship inside of one of those glass jugs, or 12 clowns exiting a VW Beetle at the circus. Didn’t sleep the first night at all hardly, all I wanted to do is lay there awake and feel how great this mattress was.. omgggggg, unbelievable. No more aches, no lower back pain, no discomfort. I had ordered the Twin XL, because I\'m 6\'4"" and 220 lbs, so I wanted a long enough mattress. To think that I spent or wasted $1200 on a King pillow top mattress and I could have bought two of these, side by side on the box springs for about $300 or less. In the picture I built the long runs for the bunk beds out of 2x6 cut to 84"" long. To support the mattress I cut the Amish wood 1""x 8\'s and 1""x10"" boards to 40"" long which allowed a half inch clearance on either side of the mattress. Just note here the mattress is like they describe a touch on the firm side but very comfortable. Sleep like a baby. My opinion you cannot go wrong with this mattress it\'s fantastic.UPDATE: So I built a set of bunk beds but only ordered one of these mattress\'s on about Sept20th 2020, instead of two and then may be become disappointed and try to return both. So as it turns out the mattress is fine so three weeks later Oct 15th I went back on Amazon here where I bought the first one to buy the exact, identical, mattress and was sticker shocked at the dramatic price increase. I had paid $139 for the first one, BUT for me to buy it again three weeks later I would now have to pay $169....$30 more, not $5 or maybe $ 10, but $30 more which instantly made me browse for a different mattress. I may share some of the guilt as I had only praise and good things to say about this mattress. Now with a bitter taste in my mouth I can only say I would NOT recommend this mattress and to look elsewhere for better pricing. So much for customer appreciation.

My mattress before this one was an extra firm traditional double-sided tight top variety. I bought it that way for support. Which it still was after 15 years, but also uncomfortable.I read a lot of reviews and was shocked how mattresses are delivered ""compressed and rolled"" today. I took a chance on this one which was medium-firm (and gray).I lugged it from the front entry to my back bedroom inch by inch. It is 75 Lb heavy. Which was a good sign because a similar traditional mattress tops 100 lbs. I realized the lighter weight the hybrid is, the lower the ratings were. I got it unboxed and rolled out on my new 3500 Lb bedframe (B09ZRVVXR3). I am not 3500 lbs! Followed the instructions and slit the plastic. It immediately decompressed to 11"". Wow!I did not sleep on it for 3 days. My 2 cats however abandoned me and immediately called it home. They were tired of sleeping on the futon with me on the 6"" twin memory foam guest mattress. Sorry, but I discovered that I hate memory foam. It is NOT for big people. Neither is a twin bed. I am beyond the point of ""shish-ka-bobbing"" in order to turn over. And on a pure memory foam, it is torture. Or, at best exercise.In short, this full-size hybrid mattress does support my weight. The inner springs are strong and give me the bounce and spring I need to sleep comfortably and roll around normally! YEA! It also reached 12"" bottom to middle-mattress crown. The sides are 11"". The side support is OK and as expected. For a thin person it is strong. The sides more or less behaved liked my former mattress. No complaints there.FYI - I flattened out all of the cardboard shipping boxes for the mattress, frame and headboard and placed them as a mattress platform on top of the bed frame\'s slats. I was concerned about the long-term effects of the bottom springs poking through and sagging in the empty spaces between the metal slats. This new mattress is NOT double-sided, and the bottom has VERY THIN support material for the springs. The mattress does slide a bit, but that is OK. It actually makes it easier for me to change the sheets.I also used and left in place a nylon ratchet strap (B01M13QUC7) at the middle of the bed frame to pull the frame tight inward so that the slats would not drop out in the future which can be typical with slatted bed frames.Conclusion. If you, or your combined weight, is, well, a lot, then this mattress does work fine.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States July 12, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Mattress.', 'author': 'Husky Fix', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'We’ll unpack it out of box was taking it out of plastic and this mattres started blowing air out or in it.

Now when the delivery guy just hoisted it up on his shoulder and set it on my porch, I thought how heavy can it really be? I found out pretty quickly! Now I’m not a weakling but I struggled getting the box up a small step into my house! I admit, after that I dragged it to my bedroom!Set up was easy. Unboxed it. Unrolled the mattress. This is where I must share a warning of caution…..When you are unrolling the plastic from the air suctioned plastic…. Make sure your pants are secured and that the rolling doesn’t catch the bottom of your pants. Needless to say, I did not. My pajama pant legs got caught up in the rolling unbeknownst to me, as I was excitedly pulling the plastic and I got de-pants! After fixing the breezy situation, I had a good laugh.The mattress started filling up even before removing the air suctioned plastic. I quickly removed that. Filled out pretty nicely after about 12 hours and finished filling out by 72 hours.I do admit that my partner and I did have to sleep on it about 14 hours after setting it up, as we had no where else to lay our weary heads. It held up well. It did continue to fill out for the rest of the 72 hours. No problem there.The bed is more on the softer side but firm enough. As someone who has hip and back problems from sleeping on poor quality mattresses in the past, I was relieved to wake up without the morning pains! It feels like a nice hug that engulfs and supports you at the same time.The only cons we have experienced, and I waited a month and a half to write this, is the sides and corners are really not very supportive. Sitting on the edge of the bed is out of the question, unless you have your tushy way back on the bed itself. Otherwise you’re getting yeeted onto the floor.The other con is it is not motion isolating… at all. I can feel every move my partner makes when he rolls over or gets in or out of bed. In fact when he gets in bed, I swear it’s like the force is drawing me closer into him! I love him but I need my space sometimes lolSide note, if you are putting this on a platform bed frame, invest in some stoppers. The mattress will slide…. Constantly. Amazon does sell them and I purchased some that had smiley faces that work very well.Other than those cons I would recommend this mattress.

I will not sleep on an uncomfortable mattress. I recently bought a Serta-Simmons Beautyrest Silver BRS900 “Plush” King-sized mattress (They are no longer Simmons Beautyrest since they merged or got bought out). It seems since the merger they have completely destroyed the Beautyrest brand. I slept on Beautyrest mattresses for years that were very comfortable for the price. It seems that Serta-Simmons business practice is to make their entry level beds extremely uncomfortable, in order to steer customers towards paying thousands of dollars for one of their “Black Series” mattresses, which IMO are not even that comfortable. I personally tested out half a dozen Serta-Simmons Beautyrest Black series mattresses at mattress firm, and none of them were comfortable. The Silver line is just above their entry level mattress and cost me about $750 from Mattress Firm. That mattress was not remotely plush as it was advertised. It was firm. It was so uncomfortable that I started sleeping on my couch due to the severe hip pain it was causing me. I figured it was a long shot, but bought this mattress because many of the reviews described it as being “bouncy” and “soft”. The Serta-Simmons “Beautyrest” was definitely not bouncy or soft, it was stiff as a board. They should change their name to “Painfulrest”. The purveyors of Molblly should be proud of their product. I was prepared to be disappointed but they proved me wrong. This bed is very comfortable, and I can now sleep peacefully and wake up pain free*. Thank you Molblly, and for anyone considering buying a mattress, I highly recommend staying away from the Serta-Simmons Beautyrest brand, as since the merger between them and Serta (In my opinion Serta was always low-tier in terms of quality and comfort) their quality and comfort for the price has drastically been diminished.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 30, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '3.0 out of 5 stars Quite a bit softer than I expected', 'author': 'JR Siever', 'rating': 3, 'content': 'This is my first hybrid bed (inner spring plus foam), so it was a bit of a gamble.

We recently bought a RV queen of this same brand (memory foam) and it inflated to the advertised 10"" in 24 hours. We left this one alone, using a room heater to make it quite hot in there (because they rise faster in warm environs, per the instructions) for 48 hours. After 24 hours it was at 11"", but it didn\'t rise anymore at all at 48 hours (they say 48-72 hours to fully rise). It looked ok, so we put some sheets on it and I tried it out for a nap. Wow. I sank in deep (I am 5\' 11"", 240 pounds). It felt ""gooshy"" but I stayed put. Went to my side and to my surprise found it to be really comfortable (I\'m a side sleeper and usually require a firm mattress). Now, I\'ve only spent one hour on it so far, so this is an early review, but I also rolled off the bed when I rolled to the opposite side.

I don’t know much about beds, so I used a lot of reviews and resources to educate myself in purchasing this mattress.Disclaimer: I am coming from years ago Costco Sealy that was purchased for around $300.1. Unboxing: amazing experience, it came with no damage to the shipping box, as I’ve seen with other boxes that are literally torn. It was neatly compressed and fully airtight. (A bit heavy for one person, you will need two persons to lift it upstairs)2. Expansion, bed expanded well, I didn’t measure it but it looks fully expanded from its edges. I allowed 8 hours to expand because I had no choice or space to wait 24 hours. Edges are sturdy enough for me 170 lbs. Though the pillow top sinks a little more so it looks like less support, but it’s really not.3. Feel: the Euro Top, is a game changer! If your bedsheets are soft you can take advantage of the top layer for the same and snuggle feel. The bed feels firm, but the pillow top adds that “plush” but without the sinking feel. It’s hard to explain but it feels comfortable and supportive.4. I tracked my sleep with my Apple Watch, and it looks like I had more deep and rem sleep, with this mattress compared to my previous one. Though, I can physically feel the rest.5. Cooling: I normally sweat when I sleep. I’m not sure if it was my new bedsheets but I’m sure the mattress did something. The first time I didn’t sweat in my sleep! It didn’t feel hot and I didn’t need to stick out one leg for cooling!Conclusion:If you can get viscose or new soft bedsheets this mattress experience will elevate. Overall, for its price and the upgrade to the Premier is well worth it. It firms but provides that plush feel for a stomach sleeper, my wife is a back sleeper and knocked out almost instantly. I didn’t feel pain or aches on my first sleep! And I’m grateful for a good night\'s rest, I will recommend the DreamCloud Premier version for lightweight and stomach sleepers, but I’m sure this is good for back and side sleepers as well. Now for longevity, we will see, and if I remember I’ll come back and update my experience on here.-----3 Week UPDATE:I am so happy with this purchase and my wife is as well. I am a stomach sleeper and my wife is a back sleeper. I look forward to going to sleep! Time flies in bed because it\'s so easy to fall asleep. My wife and I no joke have had more ""vivid dreams"" ever since we got this mattress I know it sounds ironic but it\'s pretty funny, not sure if the deep sleep you go into that causes this but I\'m no scientist. It\'s so hard to get out of bed at times because you\'re so cozy. I also picked a Coop cooling memory foam pillow and oh my gee the combo of bedsheets + pillow + mattress is such a life-changing experience. I know the cost is expensive but, you owe it to yourself. You spend a good portion of your life sleeping, so make a good one. I really hope this mattress holds up to what I feel now for the coming years. Oh, and the edge support is great, feels squishy but it\'s strong enough to hold while I my socks or eat on a side table.-----I Dont Know How Long UPDATE:It\'s been quite some time, but I came back to update my review. So far so good, my bed feels great, my sleep has been great, and my dreams are becoming nightmares but it\'s all good, got to fight my demons somehow.Dreamcloud has been broken in and it feels the same but you can tell it\'s not too too firm anymore, like .5 less firm. No issues with the construction or comfort. My little jumps on the bed constantly and no issues so far. Edge support is great for the morning while I put my shoes/clothes on. My wife doesn\'t get woken up in between my nightly strolls to the bathroom. I have noticed if I sleep more than 9+ hours I am getting pain but I don\'t think that is the cause of the bed and more my sleeping angle.I think the one thing that DreamCloud excels in is the pillow top, and I truly feel this is a great distinction from the hundreds of memory foam mattresses out there. I am still happy with the purchase and hope this bed can last a very long time.---Update:Still great mattress and I paired it with Sheex Duvet and Hotel Sheets Direct bedsheets and I feel I am at endgame mattress level.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 27, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Comfortable, and sturdy', 'author': 'Kristopher', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'The mattress is quite comfortable.

When you order something that costs just a few dollars shy of $1800, one would expect a well packaged product. The first bed we received was in a beat up box, the bed was not sealed in plastic and when I opened the end of the box the bed was filthy. So yeah, I wrote a bad review citing JUST the poor packaging and delivery but also stating that I couldn't review the mattress until a new one arrived and that I would update the review. Amazon told me to write a review of the seller instead.Well, the seller was Amazon, but this was not their fault though so I didn't think writing a review of them would be fair. Packaging was a manufacturer issue, not an Amazon issue.Amazon reps worked to get us a replacement mattress and it was a pretty easy process. They did a great job there. The packaging is the real issue, the boxes are just not sturdy enough to hold such a large item. Again, that is from the manufacturer, not Amazon. If the mattress is in sealed plastic it should be ok. The first one wasn't in sealed plastic and was filthy. Although I was weary about getting a replacement after seeing the condition of the first one, I knew I could return it to Amazon if it came in poor condition. Also I knew I could return it with the 365 day trial so we gave it another go.The new one arrived in a box that was worse than the first but the mattress was completly sealed so I was good with giving it a try.This thing was heavy, so make sure you have someone to help move it. it is rolled up so make saure you unroll it on your bedfarame or box springs.We got it upstairs and onto the box springs. I started to unwrap it and noticed there were some gel packets on the underside (the anti-moisture packets) so I tore a small hole in the plastic and pulled them out. The bed started to expand right away, which was awesome. It wasn't like a spring or anything, just you could see it start to expand.We got it unrolled and found the little tool to cut the plastic off which made it very easy to complete. Took the plastic off and in about 5 minutes this thing was full size and uncompressed. We left it overnight, as per instructions, but didn't sleep on it until 72 hours later. It was full size by the morning though.So far it is a little stiff but was comfortable from the git go. My wife said she woke up feeling pretty good. Our old mattress was giving us both back pains and shoulder pains, but we didn't have that with this mattress.The mattress is a bit stiff right now, but has become more comfortable after a week of sleeping on it.We are giving it a full month or two to see how it goes but for now it has become pretty comfortable.We got the pillow top version.The pro:Looks really niceThe pillow top is very comfortableWe don't have any back pain after a night of sleep.The sides of the mattress seem very sturdy. On our original mattress (beauty rest black), one of the sides is collapsing. We don't see that as an issue with this one, besides if it does there is a lifetime warranty.The lifetime warranty is an excellent benefit, as is the 365 day trial.The cons:The packaging needs some addressing. the box simply is not sturdy enough to handle such a massive object. Amazon was good in replacing the damaged one but I recommend opening the end of the box to inspect the packaging. If the entire mattress is not sealed, have it replaced.I can't say the price is a con because our other mattress was about $700 more expensive so we feel this one was a pretty good deal. I would watch for promotions.Final thoughts: So far this is a very good mattress and we are pretty happy with the purchase. In comparison to our other mattress, this one is far more comfortable and you can't beat the trial period or the lifetime warranty.I will update this if anything changes but so far so good...zzzzzzzzzzzzzz"", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Supportive, comfortable!', 'author': 'M.

Hastie', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""This review will be presented in multiple segments as time progresses. Firstly, I'd like to commend Amazon for its exceptional mattress delivery service. The delivery driver arrived promptly, and I noticed the delivery truck from my office window. They efficiently unloaded the mattress onto a hand truck and delivered it to my front door. I was prepared with my own hand truck, and the transfer went off without a hitch. It's important to note that this mattress is quite heavy, so I recommend having more than one person available if you need to transport it upstairs. Fortunately, we have a single-story home, making it a breeze to roll the mattress into the bedroom.Now, regarding the unpacking instructions: Begin by keeping the box in an upright position and cut the tape around the top. After making the cut, gently lay the box on its side. Reach inside and extract the mattress by gripping the outer plastic covering (there are two layers of plastic covering on this mattress). The mattress is folded in half, so position it close to the bed frame or box spring. Remove the outer plastic wrapping by pulling it out from underneath the mattress. Unfold the mattress so that it aligns with the frame or box spring.Next, grab and pull the second plastic cover, and carefully puncture a small hole in it. You'll hear a hissing sound, which is the air escaping from the factory shrink wrap. Using the provided cutter, remove all of the second plastic cover from the mattress. It will begin to expand. At this point, utilize the handles on the sides of the mattress to place it on the frame or box spring. The manufacturer's literature states that it may take up to 24 hours for the mattress to fully expand. However, in our experience, it expanded completely in just about 4 hours. Nonetheless, we followed the instructions and allowed it to expand into the guest bedroom for one night. I'm pleased to report that there was absolutely no off-gassing with the Dream Cloud mattress.The first night on it was amazing. More to follow.Day 3: The initial three nights of rest were truly amazing. The mattress offers the right level of firmness where it matters, without being excessively firm all around. I do experience slight neuropathy in my legs, and after the third night, I observed that it had somewhat improved. While I'm not entirely convinced that the mattress is solely responsible for this improvement, I haven't made any significant changes to my routine since sleeping on it. Additionally, my back feels more comfortable, and I'm able to switch between sleeping on my side and back with ease. I would recommend a mattress cover and this one on Amazon fit the bill. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09QM5PLBD?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1"", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 17, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Love this bed so far!', 'author': 'Divine010', 'rating': 4, 'content': ""It's only been one month since I've purchased the bed.

Many people looked to places like Ikea recently to find comparable quality at much better price points as we have recently.

Well packaged and shipped out bundled like a california roll, it was surprisingly heavy and some care was needed when opening that it didn't fling us back when the protective plastic sheathing was removed.

The biggest ding however is that the firmness level of the mattress is nowhere near a 'medium-firm' mattress compared to the other hybrid mattresses that we have which were also rated as roughly medium-firm. If the buyer has a want for a mattress on the softer side with a faux mattress topper feel then this could very well be one of the best values out on the market but as such, it's hard to get used to the fluffiness of the top layer before experiencing the 'structure' of the bedding. YMMV as comfort levels are subjective but the consensus among us who tried it at least is that it's a great buy for those looking for a more pillow-y hybrid rather than the more cushion-y trad hybrid versions out there."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States November 6, 2023', 'is_verified': False}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Beautiful bed', 'author': 'JCW', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I was using an blow up mattress, I live in a studio apartment.

This is a hybrid foam with pocket springs. I noticed that when I first sat on the mattress it was more soft and springy than my foam mattress. It has the feel that any kid would enjoy if they were jumping on their bed. My foam mattress doesn't have that type of give. Yet when I slept on it, the mattress had that firm feeling to it. So if you like to have a little bounce back from a mattress, this will give you that type of feel.I have an adjustable bed. If you are curious how these mattresses bend when you are using an adjustable bed, well the general answer is they don't, unless someone is laying on them. Mattresses are not bean bags so you need weight in the middle and in the leg/foot area if the mattresses are going to conform to the adjustable bed. Other than that, if you are lying on it, the adjustable bed and mattress will rise in a manner you would want if you are going to watch TV or read a book, but if no one is in the bed, they stay flat and just rise with the high points holding the mattress up. That actually makes it pretty easy to change sheets, because you don't need to bend over to get to the corners. I have a back that bothers me at times, which is why I bought the adjustable bed.This mattress bends great in the right places when it needs to bend. I think it's because it has individual pocket springs. So when it is bending in the middle you can see there are two rows of pocket springs that stay together in the middle of the bed and the bend is on either side of those rows. So there is no problem buying this if you are planning on using it with an adjustable bed.The only other consideration is how high it sits from the ground when you are getting in and out of your bed. Well, 10 inches is a good size if you want to be sure your fitted sheets stay on the mattress. It's also good if you plan on using a mattress topper, though with a hybrid you might not need one.You don't need a box spring, so if this is going just on a frame, it might sit a bit low, unless you have 8-inch legs on the platform. Sitting low is not necessarily bad, especially if you have a small dog or cat that likes to sleep with you. Some of those super thick mattresses can hurt the smaller dogs when they jump out of the tall beds. If you want a higher mattress without a topper, you can buy risers for your bedframe or order a 12-inch mattress."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States November 5, 2023', 'is_verified': False}, {'title': '3.0 out of 5 stars Not firm!', 'author': 'Richard', 'rating': 3, 'content': 'This mattress is well made but it is definitely not firm!

His bedroom is quite small and so the Twin was our only option, though we did buy the Twin as the XL version so that he has a bit more length. He\'s just under 6 feet tall so the extra length suits him well, and since he tends to sleep mostly on his side the Twin does work fine.So we tore open the box and carefully opened the plastic using the included cutting tool, no problem there. We placed the mattress atop the bed frame which is a raised 14 inch platform which requires no box spring and then we allowed the new mattress to expand for about 8 hours before we went to sleep. Being that our boy is a night owl he probably didn\'t climb into his newly se-up bed for another 4 or 5 hours. When he woke up I asked him how he slept and he exclaimed ""I slept GREAT!"" so I knew that he loved it. The mattress then got the rest of the day to continue to expand.I have to admit to being a little freaked out at first. After getting the rolled up mattress out of the box we laid upon his bed frame while still in the plastic and it looked quite a bit wider than the bedframe. Don\'t let that panic you like it did us. As soon as it\'s out of the plastic and is expanding that extra width disappears and the end result is a fully corrected size mattress. We did not notice any sort of aroma emanating from the mattress short of BRAND NEW fragrance. It was just fine. There are NO handles on the sides for carrying but the mattress can be easily set on it\'s side and manipulated, especially easy if you have a helper.In a nutshell, it appears that this is a really nice hybrid mattress at a great price. It seem firm enough to offer support even for a ""Husky"" person yet it offers an excellent, very soft, comfortable top, almost like a pillow top, and the mattress seems to keep him cool while he\'s sleeping.

This mattress is heavy, even when rolled up, so it's important to place the rolled-up mattress on your bed frame before you start cutting into the plastic covering.

While sleeping, things seem great until waking up, and that's when I began to notice that I felt worse in places, such as in the lumbar-region of my back and spine, and that my neck felt like it wasn't quite as well-rested as it initially had been.Now I feel that after some time goes by, sleeping in the same spot, pretty much, eventually literally weighs on the pocket coils or coiled pockets that this thing has... This mattress is 10-inches thick, and it is fairly plushy, so although I do weigh more than 100 pounds, that wasn't so much of a problem for me, considering that there is some bounce to the materials as well. It was all working out...so it seemed.I am thinking that maybe I should have gotten a 12-inch thick one... and just a little more plushiness. For anyone who may be wondering why I would order a Twin-size bed instead of a Full or a Queen, (which I would rather like), the room in which it sits is quite small, so there would be no room for anything else but a bed if I were to put a bigger frame in it.I left the plastic on for a long time because I wanted to keep the mattress as clean as possible... That is an option if you prefer sheet-covered, clean, but crackly sleeping. Personally, I prefer to sleep on a nice comfortable couch whenever possible, therefore, I will not be investing in more beds. (Certainly not seriously expensive ones... that cost more than this mattress did).This one has done for now, or is doing ok for now, but there is definitely something going on with feeling pressure points, etc. It's barely a year old, if that, and problems have already started.I am highly disappointed because I had hoped that it would last longer than it seems to be, but oh well.Would buy again for other people; would not buy again for myself."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States June 7, 2022', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Eh', 'author': 'Jeremy Eaton', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'It was okay.

I\'ll stand by what I wrote below and reaffirm just HOW MUCH we love this mattress. It\'s been extremely comfortable since day one. I no longer wake up with back and hip pain. Never expected as much comfort from such an inexpensive mattress that comes rolled and compressed to your door. We have never had any issues with smell or any sinking thus far. I will say, it was a tad more firm than I expected, even though we decided so within the first 2 weeks of getting it. We did add an inexpensive foam topper which gave us just the added cushioning we wanted with the firmer support from underneath. My point: I have zero hesitations recommending this and I would buy another one tomorrow in a heartbeat.**8/20/16: I carefully scoured the options and read through every piece of feedback on this mattress before pulling the trigger. ""A mattress in a box, delivered like a sleeping bag?? AND it\'s supposed to be great?! Yeah right."" But, (thank you Reviewers who give their honest feedback), I settled on trying this (I NEVER buy anything without checking reviews). For the price, it was worth the risk. I\'ll say flat out I have never bought a bed I haven\'t tried first. We purchased a $1300 bed 2 years ago we have hated since day 1...and despite promised ""warranties"", the dealer never made our misery right. So to Amazon I go and I\'d rather buy something many people have unbiasedly reviewed then buying in a store where only the salesman tells me it\'s wonderful. It\'s arrived...ahead of schedule and I\'m thrilled. First off, someone made a comment about it looking like the FedEx truck delivered it with a tow winch....yes, this is has been through the grinder. Thankfully my mattress inside was well wrapped. It\'s heavy - you\'ll need 2 people. Put it near the bed when you unwrap it, because within just a minute or 2, it will fully expand to its size. It puffed up instantly and filled to its shape. I am SERIOUSLY impressed that this shows NO sign of being compressed...it looks like the mattress store just delivered. After letting it puff for 4 hours, I laid on it....it is firm but giving. I cannot wait to try it tonight...and cannot wait to follow up on this in a few weeks/months. Off the bat, I can\'t recommend this enough. How this mattress is this price (thanks China), I have no idea. It looks and feels like one that should be much more.

I rarely write reviews (good or bad) but wanted to for this, since the reviews are what made me give it a shot. I want to start off with saying; is it a $1,500 mattress quality or feel? No absolutely not. But rating it based off of the price; I am very happy so far.The King replaced our Queen Size Caspar Mattress- I am 8 months pregnant and we just needed a King for my comfort and once baby comes for bed side sleeping- we just had to go to the King. With baby on the way though there was no way I could replace with another Caspar at this time. I knew the price range I was shopping in and got something that I am very happy with for the cost.Some reviews showed the springs on the sides poking out- if you look close or put your hand on the side- yes you can see/ feel the springs. But that doesn’t really bother me. If it’s a deal breaker though I would say maybe not for you.I didn’t measure to see if it rose to its full height.. I’m not that picky, again for the price.It’s kind of a “Goldie Lock” Bed where it’s not too soft not too firm- if you want firm it definitely isn’t for you. It’s a medium/ soft I would say. I weigh 160 right now pregnant- and I definitely sink into it- but that’s what I like and prefer. This is my first “Hybrid”- normally I don’t have anything with springs. But for the price I was too nervous to do a true bed in a box.It is on a new King Size Frame- the mattress is maybe 2 inches short on the sides (width wise) but super hard to say if that’s the mattress or the frame from Wayfair.In summary I’m giving it 5 stars- but basing it off the price I paid- I think it is priced fairly. And if need be we can always do a mattress topper if needed. We may end up doing that- only bc the sides are very soft- so getting in and out is a little hard being pregnant and I didn’t have that issue on my Caspar.. that’s probably my biggest negative.We did let it rise up in the dining room for 24 hours before putting it on the frame as well.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 1, 2022', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': ""4.0 out of 5 stars No longer feel my husband's flopping around!!!!"", 'author': 'KARLA', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'So far, so good. We\'ve only been sleeping on this mattress for 4 days now, but we are both perfectly content with it at this point. I love that it arrived in a box that I could handle on my own (I\'m very, very little -- well under 5 feet tall) and the box didn\'t take up an entire room, as we had to first put our new bed together before we could open the mattress box. The box was about 3ft X 16in X 16in, so absolutely able to stick it in a corner of the room while we got the bed built and readied the room. When opening the box, we found the mattress to be well sealed up inside, amazingly shrunken down in size and relatively easy to get out of the box with the two of us working together (there\'s the outer cardboard box, then the vacuum sealed clear plastic holding the mattress in, then another layer of material around the mattress), I must warn future customers: USE GREAT CAUTION AT EACH STAGE OF UNPACKING THIS MATTRESS -- DO NOT USE A KNIFE, SCISSORS OR UTILITY BLADE AS YOU MAY VERY LIKELY CUT UP YOUR MATTRESS!!! Anyway, once out of all the packaging, the mattress began to come to life. Fortunately (I guess, in retrospect), we didn\'t have any new sheets for this new size mattress and we had to wait for the sheets to arrive from Amazon separately, which allowed the mattress plenty of time to ""plump up"". But even within just a few hours, we could see and feel how soft and comfy it was. I was determined to get a hybrid mattress, and this one has lived up to its description thus-far. The only complaint I have, and I\'ve already sent this comment to the manufacturer, is that the top layer of memory foam is very ""memorable"" --- I\'m used to doing the old hand trick where you splay your hand and press it firmly down onto whatever memory foam thing you\'re dealing with (a pillow, a mattress topper, whatever) and the imprint of your hand should be easily visible in the memory foam for a little while........when I do this to our mattress, I get NO IMPRINT at all, the mattress immediately goes back to its usual shape. Maybe it\'s me and I don\'t understand something about memory foam mattresses, perhaps they are supposed to spring right back, but it\'s not my idea of ""memory"" foam if it doesn\'t ""remember"" anything!Besides the issue just discussed, I\'m only giving it 4 stars (instead of 5) because there\'s room for improvement. It would have to be a truly amazing, awe-inspiring mattress to get a 5-star review out of me as I always want the manufacturers/producers/engineers/etc. to strive for improving their products, especially something so critical as a mattress. That being said, if I could give it 4.5 stars (four & one-half), I would. It\'s absolutely a lovely mattress. It looks and feels like a much more expensive mattress (I\'m truly shocked at how little I paid for this mattress, especially considering what I paid for my last brand-new mattress many, many years ago). The top feels like organic cotton (I don\'t know what it is and I\'m not saying that it is cotton at all, I\'m just saying it FEELS like it), it is super soft and breathable. The individually wrapped coils of the innerspring portion has performed exactly as I hoped it would: FINALLY, I no longer feel like I\'m in an earthquake when my husband comes to bed or when he flops around like a fish out of water all night. I had gone to sleeping on the sofa most nights because I simply could not stand sleeping near him. He doesn\'t ROLL over, he does the human equivalent of a 3-point-turn, and each point of that turn is another huge flopping action. I mean, I was miserable for years. And now, I have yet to feel him come to bed at all, nor feel ANY movement throughout the night. This is an extreme improvement.The quality (so far -- remember, I\'ve only been sleeping on this new mattress for a few nights) far exceeds what the price-point would lead you to believe. Everything is at least as good, or better, than you\'d probably ever expect from such an inexpensive mattress. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for an UNDISTURBED night\'s sleep, especially if you\'ve got an overactive, flippy-floppy bed partner, or a large dog that sleeps with you (or ANY dog/dogs, actually).

I was amazed at how compact the mattress was inside the box and impressed at how quickly it expanded into its proper shape and size once released from its plastic and cardboard prison. Very little odor, if any at all, when released from its bonds. The fabric the top is made of is quite soft and plush, texture wise. It's not quite as comfortable as I'd hoped so I added a padded quilted topper to it which has helped significantly. I think if the top of the mattress itself was a thicker pillow top I'd be comfier. There's a lot of movement in this bed; not enough that it's noticeable when my cats are rough housing but certainly noticed when a bed partner shifts in their sleep. I apparently like an incredibly soft mattress top, but this has served me very well considering it was less than $300 when purchased and I hadn't felt it/laid on it before buying. I honestly haven't had a single issue with it that the topper, adequate air flow in the bedroom, and super soft sheets haven't fixed. I haven't had any issues so far with sagging anywhere, however only grown adults have used it. If you don't have AC and are a hot sleeper I highly suggest a fan. I recommend getting a mattress protector for it as well, because spilling dark soda in bed can lead to unpleasant stains (I suggest one with a terry cloth texture). Will it be my bed forever? Probably not, but for under $300 I won't feel bad when it's time comes and I need to buy a new one.

I picked up this mattress for my retired in-laws as a thank you gift for all they do for us. Their old mattress was a pillow-top, but after they stayed at our house on our memory foam mattress while watching the kids several months back and hearing how well they slept, we just had to see if this would be an improvement. Our memory foam mattress was 12-inch and we paid about 2 grand for it 9 years ago. This one was not the cheapest we found on amazon, but it looked like a good deal and I wanted to see what the gel memory foam was like.The product arrived via Prime delivery in a big yellow box. Inside the box the mattress was folded in half and rolled up in a compressed form inside a plastic sheeth, which was inside a sort of plastic canvas bag along with an envelope and a little journal, a warranty card, with an amusing cartoon about a thief falling asleep on a Sweetnight mattress and getting caught while robbing a house. The package also came with a little letter opener which I used to slice through the plastic holding it together and I then unrolled it onto my in-laws queen-sized box spring. I then slit one end of the plastic bag that was still holding it compressed and I pulled the bag off of the mattress like removing an envelope from outside of a letter.The first thing I noticed was how quickly the mattress decompressed. Our mattress 9 years ago took about 48 hours to visibly decompress, whereas with this mattress, within a matter of a couple seconds the mattress expanded from about 6-7 inches tall to 10 inches. I laid down on it felt completely decompressed and fluffy soft. I read in the instruction booklet that one side of the mattress was firmer than then other so I decided to video the difference between each side. I had my 6 year old daughter walk and jump around on the mattress with a glass of water sitting in the middle, first with the soft side up, then with the firmer side up. You could see in the videos that the soft side transfers a good bit of motion just walking around on the mattress and the firmer side requires her to jump to really see the water move (well you could see if Amazon allowed me to upload more than one video, but it doesn't so I just uploaded the firm side my in-laws decided to sleep on).How does that translate to laying on the bed, well my in-laws decided to go with the firm side because they were concerned that too soft a mattress might cause back issues. After 3 nights (the amount of time the instructions say to let the bed expand) it is the best night sleep they've had in years and they just keep thanking us for the wonderful mattress. Though, they have not noticed a difference with it from the 1st to the 3rd night, so I'm not sure if it expanded much at all. They see no need to try the softer side of the mattress, they are so pleased with it so far.Pros: Good price, easy to set up, decompresses quickly, pillowy soft and cool, plus an amusing little cartoonCons: Like all memory foam mattresses it, has the faintest foam odor, but after putting sheets on it I honestly couldn't smell it anymore, and the instructions say the faint smell dissipates quickly."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 6, 2017', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great Value and Comfort from a Box!', 'author': 'tamijj', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'A couple years ago we got a great deal on a little travel trailer, but we haven\'t really used because the mattress in it is so incredibly uncomfortable... who wants to ""get away"" when you end up tossing and turning and getting no rest and having massive back aches while on “vacation”? We had spent THOUSANDS for our king mattress but we couldn\'t spend that kind of money on a mattress for the trailer. Then a friend told us to check this one out on Amazon.We were pretty skeptical but we really want to use the trailer, instead of just looking at it sitting next to the house, so we ordered and two days later FedEx dropped the box on the front porch. The box is pretty heavy but easy enough to move around with a foldable hand truck we have.Inside the box, the mattress is rolled up and vacuum-packed and comes with instructions and a special tool to get the thick plastic cut open without damaging the mattress. It\'s a good idea to unroll the mattress on the bed platform where you will be using it. It\'s just easier to handle that way. We don\'t know exactly how long it took for the mattress to fully decompress since we unwrapped it and then left it in the trailer overnight.When we went in and checked on it the next day, late morning, it was all fluffed up and ready to use! At that point, we took some time to check out the quality of the mattress and we are very impressed with what seems to be pretty high-end materials and workmanship.Then came the real test... we crashed on the mattress for awhile. Wow! A huge upgrade from the flimsy old mattress that was in the trailer when we got it! We went ahead and took nice long nap and really enjoyed it! We cannot believe how great this mattress is for the price.One of the really cool things about this mattress is that you can choose to have the firm side up OR the soft side up. We decided to put the softer side up and, like I said, we really enjoyed the nap!

It REALLY needed to be replaced, because I was waking up with backaches and neckaches. After exhaustive research, I found this mattress. It had wonderful reviews, a 10 year warranty and the features that I was looking for. I was extremely worried about buying a mattress sight unseen. What if I got one that was either too soft or too hard and then I was stuck with it? But when I saw this one, I felt better about trying it because it's flippable with a softer and a firmer side. I figured that would decrease the probability of not liking the mattress. I was correct because this mattress is like sleeping on a cloud. The minute I laid on it I knew that this was going to change the way I felt in the morning. I sink right into it at night and wake up refreshed with no more aches and pains. I tried both sides and like the softer side. I'm a side sleeper and the softer side feels more comfortable on my neck. I also like that it has the layer of cooling gel memory foam to prevent me from overheating. I tend to get hot at night and this has kept me nice and cool. I'm amazed at how much I like this mattress. Next time we have to buy a mattress, I'll definitely come back to this brand.Here's a little information about how this mattress arrived. It comes compressed in a roll covered in plastic. It was in a smaller box than I expected, but it did have some weight to it. When I first took it out of the box, I was worried that I must've gotten duped and purchased a subpar mattress. Man, was I wrong!! I used the included tool to cut the plastic wrapping around it and then rolled it out over the box spring. It immediately started to grow bigger, but not to it's total height. Like the instructions said, I left it out for 24 hours to make sure it got to it's ultimate height before using. It had a chemical smell to it when it arrived. It dissipated a bit in the 24 hours I left it out, but not totally. I sprayed both sides with Febreeze and left it out another 24 hours. The smell was totally gone after that.

We had a queen-sized bed and decided to upgrade to a king-sized bed. As such, we researched the best options on the market. My wife and I did not agree on what we wanted. I wanted a mattress that was medium-firm that confirmed to the body and my wife wanted something more on the firm side. We were both leery of a “bed in a box,” but we were willing to give it a try.Since we were upgrading to a king-sized bed, I ordered the king-sized mattress. The box arrives and it took two guys carrying it from the truck. The box had a sticker that said “86 lbs.” My 19 year old son and I were easily able to pick the box up and bring it inside. I opened the box and laid the plastic wrapped shrunken mattress out on the floor. When assessing the mattress and the bed setup, I figured the best way for setup was to put it on the bed before opening it. We lifted it onto the bed and used the handy plastic cutters that came in the instruction kit. NOTE - make sure you read the instructions and use the cutter that comes with the mattress - if you used scissors, knife or other cutting device, you could run the risk of damaging the mattress and/or mattress cover. There is a very sturdy plastic wrapping around the outer area to hold the mattress in the cylindrical form. You cut this plastic first and then cut the plastic around the mattress. As soon as we cut the plastic and got it off, it came alive and started expanding (this the importance of getting it placed on the bed first). I had already read the mattress description that the mattress is firm one side and soft on the other, so I knew which side we wanted. I laid on the mattress right then to give it a try and I was so impressed from that moment. My wife and I both slept so peacefully that first night. We have slept on it several nights now and it is so comfortable. I like the fact that we can roll over and not disturb one another as the mattress limits motion through the whole bed when someone moves. I am very hot natured and I have to say that this mattress does not cause me to burn up.

I chose the firm side up which seemed really firm to me, but I had been doing my best fortune cookie impression nightly for years since I\'m a side sleeper who was sleeping on a sagging latex mattress. It took a few nights for my body to correct itself, but this is an unbelievably comfortable bed. It\'[s firm, yet enveloping; there\'s is no sagging anywhere - no matter where I lie on the bed; and it stays cool!! I really love this bed!I WOULD ABSOLUTELY BUY IT AGAIN IN A HEAT BEAT!!', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States April 25, 2018', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Surprised at the quality! Super simple and easy.', 'author': 'Derek', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I\'ve always went to physical stores to purchase a mattress. This is my first time taking a leap of faith and ordering one online. I was not disappointed in the least! My girlfriend and I wanted an upgrade in size (we had been using a full mattress before) and decided to go with the Sweetnight King. It came *very* quickly, and we unfolded it and let it air out for about an entire day. We slept on it the night we received it (the instructions say wait 72 hours but it seemed ready after the first night). Before purchasing I read other reviews that claimed there was a smell that eventually went away, maybe we were just lucky but there was no unpleasant odor at all in our mattress at all.As for the mattress itself, there is one caveat I should state here. When we first got it we followed the advice of the instructions which recommend trying the ""soft"" side first (it can be slept on either side, a soft or medium-firm side) because it was like ""sleeping on a cloud."" Well, I\'m about 240 lbs and spend a lot of time lifting heavy weights in the gym. The soft side was *definitely* not made for me. It\'s very soft, and probably perfect for someone who doesn\'t weigh much, but felt uncomfortable for me. However, after about 3 nights we made the decision to flip the mattress to the FIRM side, and it was the best decision ever. I wake up with no back pain, feel refreshed and energized. A huge improvement over my old mattress. The firm side does wonders for my back as well, which on both the soft side and my old bed would hurt quite regularly. So if you\'re heavier like me, keep in mind the firm side might be a better option for you.All in all, I absolutely love this mattress. Very happy with the purchase, and would recommend to others, despite never having thought I\'d make such a purchase online!', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 7, 2020', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '3.0 out of 5 stars Too firm, odor lasted about 2 weeks, inexpensive but seems to be made well', 'author': 'NJ2F', 'rating': 3, 'content': 'MY RATING & QUICK OVERVIEW3.6/5 starsIt is not soft as advertised, could smell less, offer better edge support and the manufacturer should include all trail period, return policy and warranty information up front, with the product and have it available to read on their website. All I know is that it has a 10 year warranty (prior to purchase).BACKGROUND INFOAbout Me: 32yo male, 5’11”, 180 lbs, active. Incident about 2 years ago caused chronic lower back pain. Stretching/exercises/TENS/heating pad help. I don’t take medication. Recently, my back would take up to 8 hours to relax and loosen up. Then I would go to bed and have the same issue the next day.Typical Sleeping Positions: 90% side with top leg bent, 10% backOld Mattress: Only 3 years and 2 months old. It’s a Steinhafel’s brand luxury pillow top. First 6 months were amazing! Unfortunately, mattress became uncomfortable shortly after the 120 night trial period ended and is just awful now. Still looks brand new.SHIPPING & BOX CONDITIONUPS Next Day Air Saver from Northwest to Midwest USA. Box arrived in good condition with a few small punctures. Tape was ripped off half of one side on top and bottom of box.DIMENSIONS, WEIGHT & PACKAGINGThe queen mattress should measure 80x60x10 and weigh about 64 lbs. In reality, it is slightly wider than 60 inches as it hangs off my box spring and past my headboard a little over 0.25 inches on each side.I was able to get it inside, unpacked and carried up to a second floor bedroom by myself. The average (fit) person shouldn’t have a problem as long as it’s kept compressed until you get it to where you want it.Mattress was compressed in a heavy-duty plastic bag, wrapped several times with heavy-duty plastic, placed in a weaved plastic drawstring bag and shipped in a heavy-duty Sweetnight branded cardboard box.MANUFACTURE DATE & RECOMMENDED OPENING PERIODThe mattress I received was manufactured October 2017.In the Q&A section, Sweetnight mentioned opening it within 6 months and that they add an extra 0.5 inches of memory foam to the total height because if it stays compressed too long the foam may not fully expand. It measures exactly 10 inches with the cover on.DECOMPRESSION EXPERIENCEMattress expanded quickly and reached nearly 100% in about 2 hours. Like another reviewer, I needed to remove the cover and adjust the corners because they initially expanded to only 90%. After adjusting the corners, they expanded in full by the next morning.SMELL/ODORI have an excellent sense of smell and this mattress gives off the typical memory foam odor. The odor was strong enough to fill the room. It did not give me a headache or make me feel sick. I have a Protect-a-Bed waterproof protector over the mattress and after a day or two I detected odor while sleeping. I ended up pulling back the sheets and protector to allow the mattress to air out until bedtime. After 1 week, I washed my sheets and removed the protector to allow the mattress to air out again and this time it did not fill the room with odor. If I put my nose to the mattress and sniff I can still detect a very slight odor. I’ll probably let it air out every week until it completely goes away. Manufacturer should not claim it is completely odor free. Minus 0.5 stars***EDIT: After pulling back the sheets to let it air out for the 2nd week, I noticed no odor wafting from the mattress. Even if I put my nose to the mattress, I cannot detect any more odor!FIRMNESS LEVELS (1=soft, 10=firm)I do not agree with the manufacturer or other reviewers that state the soft side of this mattress feels soft or like sleeping on a cloud. It’s much too firm for what I imagine sleeping on a cloud is like. As a point of reference, I’d rate my luxury pillow top a 3. The Tempur-Pedic TEMPUR-Flex Supreme gets a 4.5. The soft side of this mattress gets a 6.5 and the firm side gets an 8.5. I assume this mattress would feel softer to a heavier person and firmer to a lighter one. Minus 0.5 star.SUPPORT & COMFORTThe gel infused top layer adapts quickly if you roll over. The support feels similar (in a way) to the $2,300 Tempur-Pedic TEMPUR-Flex Supreme that another family member uses. However, the TEMPUR-Flex Supreme utilizes a slower adapting memory foam, is less firm overall and is much more comfortable...but it’s $2,300!Soft side is firm, but your body sinks in (maybe up to 1.5 inches) and the foam molds to your body and supports your curves. So yes, it’s firm, but supportive and comfort is acceptable. So far it’s better than my non-supportive pillow top. The firm side is way to firm and hard for me.The 3-zone middle layer is made up of 3 different pieces of foam. The pieces under your head and feet are softer while the middle piece under your hips is firmer. Just by laying and/or pressing down with my hand, I can feel the difference. I wish the middle layer was made up of the softer foam only.I was reading somewhere that men should look for a mattress that is softer under their shoulders and women should find one that is softer under their hips due to bone density and body structure and where each gender would benefit from pressure relief. With that being said, this mattress should be good for men, but I would caution women because the foam under their hips may be too firm.COOLING GELThe top layer of foam is infused with gel to allow for better cooling while you sleep. This does help and not once did I wake to find myself overheated. If you sleep on the firm side, you will not have gel infused foam to help keep you cool as it is only on the soft side.EDGE SUPPORTEdge support is ok for sleeping, but very poor for sitting. I can sleep right on the edge and do not feel like I am going to fall out. The mattress compresses significantly if I sit right on the edge to put on socks/shoes. If I sit so the back of my knees are touching the mattress, the edge does not sink in that much. Minus 0.1 star.MATTRESS PROTECTOR & DEEP POCKET SHEETSI am using a Protect-a-Bed protector over this mattress and it affects the feel of the memory foam. I think it makes it a bit firmer/harder because the air cannot escape as easily and because the thin layer of waterproof backing on the protector is not stretchy so when you lay down it provides a bit of tension keeping you from sinking in as fast/far. BUT, you really should be using a waterproof protector with any memory foam mattress as the foam will suck up any moisture (sweat, spilled liquids, urine, etc.) and is practically impossible to clean and moist foam can easily lead to mold growth. And mold is bad.This 10” mattress works well with regular and most deep pocket sheets. I am using 15” deep sheets and they work fine.SLEEP QUALITY WEEK 1 (Soft side of mattress)My quality of sleep was definitely a little better than with my previous mattress, however, I did a lot of tossing and turning. One night I made a point to look at the clock every time and it seemed like I was sleeping good for 45 minutes and then had to turn over. This went on all night, every night. I understand my body needs to get use to a new mattress, but I’ve never experienced anything like this in the past. So far, I am not pleased. Back pain is slightly better than with old mattress.SLEEP QUALITY WEEK 2 (Soft side of mattress with 3” memory foam topper)I put a 3” ViscoSoft gel memory foam topper on top of the mattress to soften things up a bit. If the mattress were really like sleeping on a cloud I wouldn’t have needed to do this. I’ve been sleeping much better after adding a the topper. I am tossing and turning significantly less and waking with much less back pain.SLEEP QUALITY WEEK 3 (Soft side of mattress with 3” memory foam topper)Same as week 2. Much better than without the topper. I am happy I already had the topper because I think it’s unacceptable to purchase one just to make the mattress more comfortable (which is what Sweetnight instructed other reviewers to do).SLEEP QUALITY WEEK 4 (Soft side of mattress with 3” memory foam topper)Same as week 2 & 3. I do not notice any permanent depressions or premature wear in the areas I sit to watch TV before bed or actually lay to sleep.PRICINGIf you are looking for a medium-firm to firm mattress, I find it to be reasonably priced at $428 for the queen size, but watch for deals. I was able to get this for $350 right after the holidays as a Prime Deal. I’ve seen it priced at $388 (includes $50 coupon) and another reviewer mentioned getting it for $400. If you want a softer mattress, this is not a good investment because you will most likely need to purchase a separate foam topper. A good one of those runs around $100.TRAIL PERIOD, RETURN POLICY & WARRANTY REGISTRATIONNo mention of trial period or return policy up front. What if I don’t like the mattress? How the heck and I going to ship this thing back? The paperwork that comes with the mattress states you have 30 days. Minus 0.1 star.Register at sweetnight.store for the 10 year warranty. I am disappointed that no additional information is provided. What’s covered? What’s not?

That doesn’t work for me, so I will contact Sweetnight to get this sorted out. ***Edit: I contacted Sweetnight and received a reply within a few hours.

To start, I bought this mattress back in June, I have had this mattress for about 6 months now.Prepare yourself for my long and winding story...After struggling with my old mattress which had become old and was starting to dent at the middle, I decided to purchase a new mattress from Amazon. In the past I had purchased a Zinus Green tea mattress, and genuinely had a positive experience. However, recent information about Zinus mattresses and fiberglass had kept me cautious about wanting to purchase another Zinus mattress again... so I decided to do a bit scrolling on Amazon and look for possible alternatives. I ended up buying a mattress from an unknown company on Amazon, only to get sent the wrong mattress (please don\'t make the same mistake I did folks! If you do purchase a mattress from an unknown company make sure to buy from a either a reputable company, or one that has a good record of satisfied customers! Also check that your packaging is clearly from the company you bought it in order to avoid stressful returning and refunding policies) Anyways, despite that, I tried to give that mattress a try and it didn\'t work-out; It was a hybrid mattress that was just too soft, and it caused nothing but back-pain and heartache. After Amazon was nice enough to refund me, I decided to give another mattress a try... I found Sweetnight.After my prior experiences I was very hesitant about purchasing another bed-in-a-box, but I decided to take the risk after a bit of research. After reading a fair amount of positive reviews both on Amazon and different mattress rating websites, as well as watching multiple video reviews on YouTube, and even reaching out to the company to ask about whether their they used fiberglass... FYI they don\'t!! And finding out the mattress not only used gel memory foam, but had flippable firmness levels, I was sold!Let\'s get down to it, shall we? (Skip here for the important stuff)I won\'t describe the packaging aspects because I can\'t remember the exact details that far back, all you have to know is that it arrived early and it was packaged well. It came with a little razor blade card/tool to to help you cut the [vacuumed-sealed] plastic wrap. However, I found it kept getting stuck while sliding against the plastic, and it made it difficult to use, so opted for a good ol\' pair of handy dandy scissors instead. It expanded quickly, no horrible smells, no bugs or weird lumps, nor any issues with it\'s expanded height. The mattress itself comes with a cover/encasement that can be unzipped for washing. I\'m not sure what exact materials are used for the cover, but apparently it\'s Rayon. However, I feel like the white top and bottom may be made with cotton or a material similar to cotton. However, it also feels very cheap and delicate. I later found out that it rips easily after my cat decided to jump on the mattress and have a cat bath, she didn\'t even purposely scratch the mattress, but rather grasped onto the top cover and it already started to rip (Side-note: My cat would like to add to this review, she says she\'s sorry and would ALSO not recommend this mattress to other cats and their human servants). To further note, I also remember accidentally spilling something on it, and using water and a wash towel to remove the stain... after rubbing off the stain with a towel and some water, it started to rip. RIP cushiony cover... if you do buy this mattress, please buy a protective cover of some kind. With that said, this mattress also seems to collect a lot of lint (at least on the soft side).The ""soft"" side is truly soft, it feels like a soft cotton cushion, akin to sitting/sleeping on a marshmallow. I believe that\'s partly due to the first layer of the mattress which happens to be gel memory foam. When you lie on top of the soft side you do sink in a little and at first it feels comfortable and soft, but overtime you realize there\'s not much support and your back will end up hurting after a while. For reference, I\'m 5\'4"" and weigh about 175 lbs. There\'s not much edge support, and you do sink at the sides. The ""firm"" side, is definitely firm and is akin to sitting/sleeping on what I can only describe as sitting on a soft piece of cardboard. Or in other words, imagine getting the firmest couch cushion and placing cardboard on top of it... or better yet, let me tell you how it actually feels like, it feels like base foam... surprise, surprise that\'s because it is BASE FOAM. Gasp!Sadly, their whole ""flippable mattress"" feature is really just a marketing scheme for customers to think they cleverly designed a mattress with adjustable firmness levels. All it is is basically flipping your memory foam mattress on to it\'s base, you can literally can do this with ANY memory foam mattress that has a firm foundation base. What\'s funny is that they didn\'t even bother making the cover somewhat similar to the soft side, it just feels like scratchy non-slip fabric of some kind (like the type of material you would expect to find at the bottom of a mattress or a couch). Also the cover I received didn\'t even have a zipper handle, I had to hook a paper-clip to try to unzip it.Now for the actually sleeping quality critiques...I\'ll be honest, when I slept on this mattress for the first 2 weeks, I was in heaven. I thought I finally found a mattress that would let me sleep soundly, and without anymore back-pain. That fantasy story didn\'t last very long. After 2 weeks, I started noticing I was starting to feel some discomfort on my lower-back. Prior to this, I had first tested the ""soft side"" for the first week, and then ""firm side"" for the second week. I had decided to sleep on the soft side for the third week after finding it more comfortable than the firm side. At first, I thought maybe it was because I had switched sides, and since the bed was still new it maybe needed some time to break-it in... but after another week my discomfort got worse and turned into back-pain. I then decided to sleep on the firm side, and it relieved some of of my back-pain for a good day or two, only to wake-up with a sore arm afterward, and eventually more back-pain. It also started to feel like I would sink-in unevenly towards the middle of the mattress. It was a no win situation. After thinking about it, I feel this bed might better for back-sleepers, specifically back-sleepers that are lightweight. As a side-sleeper (and occasionally combination sleeper), and someone whose not exactly ""lightweight,"" but rather in-between light and someone with a heavier build, I don\'t see this mattress helping anyone who sleeps on their side. It doesn\'t seem to offer support since your hips sink in, and I don\'t think it provides proper spinal alignment. I constantly wake-up with back-pain. At the moment I\'ve been trying to endure with a couple of mattress toppers (even bought one of the mattress toppers from Sweetnight, and a latex one), but even they don\'t really do much, they just make it somewhat tolerable to sleep for an extra day or two. However, every couple of days I have to flip the bed around so my back can find some sort of relief since the mattress toppers eventually give-in to it\'s poor support. If anything, I would recommend to stay clear of this bed and look elsewhere. If you have the money, invest in something better, even if it costs more. This bed is not worth it, sorry. Maybe some might find this bed comfortable, but I feel maybe only a child or someone whose lightweight, otherwise, there\'s 50% chance you\'ll either hate or love it.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States November 18, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars A good bed', 'author': 'AmyChalfont99', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'This mattress is great!

We purchased this with a metal bed frame/foundation. I regret doing that and will be purchasing a traditional boxspring and frame as soon as finances allow. The foundation we purchased has a large center support ""beam"" down the middle that causes our mattress to sit differently over that spot. At night I feel like I am rolling up hill just to snuggle with my husband. I don\'t like it at all! Plus, I could see this causing my mattress to eventually have indentations and uneven wear because we tend to sleep in either side of the center beam of the foundation. Also, the foundation is impossible to move as it has no wheels like a bed frame does.The mattress is still fantastic....with a traditional boxspring I know I will be much, much happier!! Don\'t get those metal foundations...splurge for a traditional boxspring, if at all possible!Original review (January 2020): I got this mattress to replace another memory foam mattress I\'ve had for about 7 years. This one is different than my other one...it is the perfect combination of soft yet supportive. The memory foam I had before was very hard and, though I loved it, when you first got in bed, it was like you were laying on a pallet of bricks with a sheet on it. It would eventually soften up, but initially it was extremely hard. This mattress is not like that one...this one is comfortable the moment you get in bed.I was a little concerned getting the 10"" since my previous mattress was 14"", but it hasn\'t been an issue at all. It opened to full height within about 30 minutes and there was absolutely no smell. We did not follow directions and wait 48 hours....we slept on it 5 hours after putting it up...we don\'t have another bed and we both had work in the morning, so we had no choice.For the price we are extremely pleased with this mattress. We are fully prepared, based on the price, that we probably won\'t get more than a couple years out of it, but at less than $200 for a king size mattress, we are totally OK with that!', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 20, 2019', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great after 3 years (and counting!)', 'author': 'Dejah S.', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I was reading about 1000 reviews on beds before finally committing to one. I will update this review in time to see how it performs in the future, but for now I wanted to add to the reviews the overwhelmed shoppers like myself will see. I wrote this review after having it for 2 weeks, but now after 3 years, my positive comments still hold up!Overall, I absolutely love this bed. It came right when it was promised, and I let it expand for nearly the entire 48 hour recommended time. It\'s only gotten to around 9"", but I\'m not too worried about it, it\'s comfortable and a very good size as is, wouldn\'t change a thing. There was a slight chemical smell that has gone away as I let the mattress rise. I also read that people had trouble with fiberglass... well don\'t remove the cover. I believe it is to protect the mattress from some liquids, and it isn\'t intended to be removed. So I avoided that and don\'t have a problem with it at all.My biggest worry was mold. Thankfully no other reviews mentioned mold, so I thought I was safe. And when I received it, there was no appearance or smell of mold whatsoever. Good stuff!When people explain that it is both soft and firm, they are absolutely right. The first maybe 2 inches are soft, while the rest is supported by a more firm foam. This allows me, a small 120lb woman, to sink in but not keep sinking in. I hated memory foam because I would never sink the way I wanted so it felt way too firm. I really feel like I am supported in all the ways I need to be. I have never woken up in any pain, and I have even been sleeping all the way through the nights. I guess you don\'t realize how much you were suffering on a bad mattress until you get a new one!Finally, it is even a very comfortable mattress for 2! I don\'t find my arm getting sore or loosing circulation in any cuddling positions so far. I know that is a little weird, but for anyone looking for a mattress for 2, I hope it helps. The ""medium"" feel of both soft and firm has kept us both very happy, as I am someone who loves a soft bed, and him firm.The other biggest complaint I\'ve read is that it doesn\'t last very long, so I updated my review about a year later. So far, it works just as well as the first day I got it! I\'m still so comfortable!!I am updating again after 3 years. I am still so happy and comfortable on it! It does feel like the top ""soft"" later got a little softer, but the high density part beneath remains wonderfully supportive. I also don\'t feel like the additional softness over time is a bad thing by any means. My husband and I do not fall to the middle anywhere, and still cuddle comfortably through the full night.The only bad thing is that I babysat for a dog who loved thrashing around on a bed, and I think his nails caused some small kind of pilling effect on the top foam layer. But even with that, I don\'t feel it and it doesn\'t affect the function of the mattress. You only notice if you are running your hand over the bed and looking for it.After 3 years, I could not be happier.

Boy, was I wrong! I\'m 68 and I\'ve been picky about my bed for many years. I\'ve paid upwards of $1000 for a mattress several times. A good night\'s sleep is so important. Now that I\'m older I was unhappy with a firm mattress as I would get sore spots - hips, shoulders, ribs, anywhere that the pressure was too much. So I thought about a foam mattress. Upon looking, I saw that this mattress had pages of great reviews, including ones that claimed they didn\'t wake up with sore spots. I checked the return policy and felt safe trying this one out. I was pretty sure it would be going back.I\'ve now had the best night\'s sleep that I\'ve experienced in years. This mattress is unbelievably comfortable. There were zero issues with it expanding and it was ready enough for me in 24 hours. I have no idea how high it got and I didn\'t care. I was just desperate to be comfortable and rested so I used it the second night.Everyone is looking for different things in a mattress, so I\'m sure this isn\'t for everyone, but for me it was the perfect mattress at an unbelievably good price. It came sooner than promised and was perfectly packaged, clean and relatively odor free. I couldn\'t be happier with this purchase and I\'d buy it again in a heartbeat.On a side note, I have a small bedroom and wanted the bed to have as small a profile as possible. I ordered the Amazon Basics Foldable Metal Platform Bed Frame with Tool Free Setup. Listed price at this time is $119, but I checked the ""new and open box"" listing and got it for $70.

The build quality and luxurious materials used are high grade. Overall, the Sapira is a class act.Day 1: The mattress arrives in a tall square-box, about 2x2x4. I attached a photo of what the mattress looks like compressed inside the box. Upon placing the mattress on my boxspring, I cut the plastic off and the bed immediately sprung to life, literally, as the coils decompressed. Yes, there is a noticeable off-gassing smell, but it\'s not offensive. I left my window open at night, and 90% of the smell was gone by the next morning.Day 2: At first, the mattress was a bit firm, but after about 24-36 hours the mattress had fully decompressed and was much more comfortable. It\'s probably a 6.5/7 out of 10 on the firmness scale, the way most online professional mattress websites suggest. The top Avena foam layer sleeps cool, so I don\'t overheat. The bounce the Avena foam + the pocketed coils provide makes moving around, and getting out of bed effortless. The off-gassing smell is just about gone now.Day 3: Decided to get rid of my old mattress and keep the Sapira. I sleep mostly on my back, but sometimes on my side and stomach throughout the night. The only sleep position I thought wasn\'t going to work out was the side position, because of the firmness, but the 3 inches of Avena + memory foam actually provide just enough sinkage, while keeping my spine aligned. The off-gassing smell is completely gone now. I bought a mattress protector, and then my bed sheet goes over that to complete the package.When I bought this mattress last Sunday, there were 20 left in stock with Amazon. As of this morning, only 9 Queen-size beds were left in stock, while some sizes other than Queen were already out of stock. So clearly word is getting out about this mattress. At $1,325, it\'s also a lot less expensive than every other hybrid mattress on the market, most of which will cost at least $2,000 more than this one, and will require you going to a showroom, and taking time off work to be home for delivery.In conclusion, I highly recommend this mattress. Please feel free to ask me any direct questions on here. Also, if you have time, I recommend reading the review on Sleepopolis, as it\'s the most comprehensive professional review that matches my own experience.Update: although I bought a Claritin mattress protector, and although when I called Sapira customer service they recommended having one too, I removed it on Day 4. It added a ""plastic"" feel to the surface of the bed that became unbearable. Once I removed it, that initial softness I experienced on Day 1 came back again. I only intend to use just my bedsheet from here on out. I recommend you do the same.((On a side note, I suggest ignoring the only other two reviews on here, both two stars. Unlike myself, neither one is a confirmed buyer of this product. The first review is too short to be real for a legitimate mattress evaluation by an actual customer. The fact that this mattress has the firmness rating it does shows the Sapira is designed for superior back support, so the reviewer\'s complaint is illogical. The second review is also partially off topic, as they discuss the manufacturers\'s website, which has nothing to do with how the mattress feels. Yes, they are correct the mattress is a little firm, but every other online review already confirms this. So to slam the product with only two stars for performing how it was designed is unfair.))', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 2, 2017', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars good quality and definitely med firm', 'author': 'KC', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I've slept on this mattress now for a week and am very pleased with its level of firmness.

The nice part about the Leesa is the memory foam top, so you get a softer feel while still enjoying a medium firm mattress. It’s even perfect for my lighter body weight and the boyfriend thinks the firmness is satisfactory too. We are both happy.The one thing that has taken some getting used to is it sleeping cooler. We’ve had to play with the thermostat in the house a bit since our previous mattress slept so hot.However the most striking thing is the GREAT SLEEP AND TOTAL AND COMPLETE LACK OF BACK PAIN!!!!

Fortunately, my city provides pickup of large items (like mattresses), so getting rid of my old mattress wasn\'t a problem. If you don\'t have such a service, you need to think about how you\'re going to dispose of your old mattress.Of course, the comfort of a mattress is very subjective and will vary from one individual to another.

Once you expand it, you'll NEVER get it back in the box!Once expanded (allow about 24 hours, although it APPEARS done in just about 3 hours or so), it seems just as sturdy as any other spring-based mattress.

I am also not sure if I can tell any difference based on the COOLING gel principle.

This mattress seem to fit our needs.It contours your body like a memory foam mattress should, but I feel like it is not very responsive. As such, when you switch positions or sleep next to someone I believe it may offset the mattress\'s ability to relieve pressure points. This is a mattress in which I feel you definitely sink into, rather than float above.The first night I slept on this mattress I still woke with a bit of a stiff back, but the second night was awful. I woke up the following morning more sore than I ever have from a mattress.

Luckily, Amazon is allowing us to return it.My husband and I both have issues with our backs, me also with my hips, and we just may need a more firm mattress. This may be a good mattress for you if you are a side sleeper who likes a more plush mattress or if you sleep alone (my hubby works away from home quite a bit and I found I didn\'t wake quite as sore when he was gone or the kids didn\'t crawl into bed with me- still sore, but not as bad).

It arrived on time, was easy to get into the house and a breeze to open. Immediately upon opening the plastic wrap and unrolling it, the mattress starting inflating in size. Within 10 minutes, it was already at 10 inches, so I was pleasantly surprised. It is easy to move, at least in the twin size, so it can be put on a foundation and taken off easily. The top cover is very nice and overall, the construction is solid. It is a medium firm mattress, so if you're looking for a soft mattress, this isn't it. Of course, all mattresses require a breaking in time, so I expect in a few months, this mattress will be a lot softer.

I'm highly allergic to fiberglass. I purchased this mattress to use in a campervan conversion. I knew I would need to cut the mattress to fit the van bed, but since this mattress was advertised as fiberglass free, I was not concerned. But just to be extra cautious, I cut the mattress outside in case there were any floating particles. I put all the original mattress covers back on the mattress. I installed it in the van on the newly built bed to air out. I thought all was well until I went out to place sheets on it 2 days later. This involved lifting the mattress and tussling with it a bit to get the sheets on. I immediately started feeling itchiness and burning which became progressively worse. I showered and scrubbed my skin 3 times before going to bed that night, but still woke in the middle of the night with intense burning/itching. I showered for the fourth and final time, but still felt periodic stinging at work the next day.I'm now struggling to figure out how to get rid of not only this mattress, but the newly built bed - I'm sure the fiberglass has now permeated the wood. I don't understand how it can be legal to advertise a mattress as fiberglass free when it so obviously has fiberglass. I know the mattress was never meant to be unzipped or cut, but I only felt comfortable doing it because the mattress was advertised as fiberglass free. Also, even if the mattress wasn't cut, there is no way to ensure it would not get punctured or accidently ripped by a child (or adult) and release fiberglass.

Not sure I\'ll ever go with full memory-foam or sleep-number air. However, as a mostly side-sleeper shopping for a new mattress, I did want to try an added foam-layer to better accommodate my shoulders for possibly less night-time side-to-side flipping. This Best Price 10"" Euro-top pocket-spring mattress (with decent reviews) seemed to me a good way to give this a try, especially at under $200 for their full-size.Overall, I\'m happy with my purchase. Can\'t yet talk about how this will hold up over time, but still sleeping comfortably on my new mattress after several weeks of use. The mattress side-support is fairly soft, so hoping I don\'t see too much shape distortion (bowing-out) as time passes. Will also be interesting to see how those comfort-foam layers of the Euro-top withstand the test of time.I still occasionally turn from side-to-side due to some firmness under my shoulders but, for less than $200 for the full-size 10"" Euro-top version, I\'m rating this 4-stars as a good mattress buy.Always appreciate feedback ... If you find this review helpful, please feel free to give it a quick \'Yes\'. Thanks.FULL-size Euro-top (10-inch) mattress details:- Shipped in 17"" x 20"" x 40"" box. Weighs 70-pounds so recommend a 2-wheel dolly or 2nd person to help carry, especially if you have steps to climb.- Mattress has standard full-size footprint of 74-75"" length x 53-54"" width. Fit my previous standard full-size box-spring perfectly.- Coil-count for the full-size is 22 x 31 = 682 total coil-count.- I chose to have shipped from Best Price. Mattress tag shows manufacture date as 201610 (Oct 2016), about 6-months before my order date. Also shows Made in China.Receiving/Unpacking:The thick cardboard shipping box looked like it had been around the block a few times before it was delivered. Sides bowed-out and fairly worn/dirty looking, however still mostly taped-shut and in one-piece. Pleasantly surprised that the mattress inside is very well packaged and remained in perfect shape.The packaging is fairly ingenious IMO. The mattress is actually vacuum-packed and hermetically sealed into a hefty clear-plastic bag. This vacuum-packing compresses the 10"" mattress down to just a couple of inches thick. Pretty much like those advertised vacuum storage-bags that reduce your stack of blankets or pillows down to the thickness of a set of sheets.My compressed & sealed full-size mattress was then folded in half length-wise (Euro-top/foam-side outward), rolled up from side to side, then wrapped with another plastic/foam layer. As I mentioned, very well packaged.I carefully cut away the outer plastic/foam layer and unfolded the compressed mattress onto my box-spring. As I then cut down the edge of the vacuum-bag, thought it was kind of neat how quickly the mattress expanded to full thickness as the air rushed into it. Fully removed the vacuum bag and my work was done. They recommend 48-hours for full decompression, but I think I could\'ve slept on mine almost immediately.My mattress had a slight new-odor smell to it when first unpacked. I\'d say similar to the odor of a new pair of sneakers when you first take them out of the shoe-box. Not overwhelming by any means, and that \'new mattress smell\' mostly dissipated away over the first few days after being released from its sealed plastic shipping bag.Mattress & comfort:- The unpacked/decompressed mattress was beautiful. No apparent flaws or discolored areas. No mattress-buttons to feel through the sheets. I always use a washable quilted mattress-cover to help protect the mattress top & sides, and this slid on with no issues. Also no fit issues using my standard full-size sheets.- The single-sided mattress (can\'t flip this one) uses a slightly coarser/rougher low-slip material on the bottom. As someone who props the headboard of my bed up a couple-inches to help avoid the occasional acid-reflux issue, I\'m really a fan of this mattress not sliding down the box-spring nearly as much over time (my previous mattress slid down a bit every night).- With its 12-gauge coils (many mattresses I shopped, use 14-gauge [or thinner] coils), I\'d rate this mattress on the Firm side. I\'m fine sleeping with the high-support of a firm mattress, but feel the extra foam layers of the Euro-top do add a level of comfort. However, due to the extra squish of the add\'l Euro-top foam layers, I did end up replacing my firm pillows with something medium-soft. My previous firm pillows sitting on top of the mattress foam, held my head just a bit too high for my taste.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 24, 2017', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Sturdy enough to stand on!', 'author': 'D.M.

This mattress has completely transformed my sleep experience for the better.First and foremost, the firmness level is just right. It provides the perfect amount of support for my back, ensuring a comfortable and restful night's sleep. I wake up feeling refreshed and without any aches or pains.The 8-inch thickness strikes a great balance between support and plushness. It's not too thin to feel the underlying structure, yet not too thick that it compromises the supportive feel of a firm mattress. The memory foam contours to my body, offering a personalized and cozy sleeping environment.One of the standout features for me is the breathability of the mattress. The memory foam is infused with cooling gel, which helps regulate temperature throughout the night. No more waking up in a sweat – this mattress keeps me cool and comfortable all night long.Setting up the mattress was a breeze. It arrived in a compact box, and once I opened it, it expanded to its full size within a few hours. The quality of materials used is evident, and I appreciate the attention to detail in the construction.As a bonus, the Lucid mattress comes with a soft and breathable cover that is easy to remove and clean. This adds an extra layer of convenience and ensures that my mattress stays fresh over time.In conclusion, if you're in the market for a firm memory foam mattress, the Lucid 8 Inch Queen is an excellent choice. It combines the perfect level of firmness, support, and comfort for a great night's sleep. I highly recommend this mattress to anyone looking to upgrade their sleep experience."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 31, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Quite firm, but also comfy.

It amazes me that anyone would buy a mattress at this price and have anything to complain about. I feel that there should at least be gratitude for the fact that we can purchase any mattress at this low of a price point. If you want something better then keep saving until it can be afforded, otherwise maybe buy a used mattress off of FB marketplace.Anyway, my experience was -1. The mattress wasn’t nearly as firm as I expected. Again, that was my own thought and expectations. It just gave too much for me. Which I can say some might love that it cradles them! Maybe it gave so much because I’m pregnant and weigh an extra 40 lbs, which puts me at 190 lbs. So maybe just not great for a heavier body.2. I wish I had bought a ten or twelve inch instead. I think that would have helped.3. No smell at all and was very cleanly packed.Bottom line - if you’re a lighter person and you need a low profile mattress and you also like to sink a bit, this one might be perfect for you.We bought it because we were In between moving, getting a new mattress and waiting for our Satviaa to be delivered.It served its purpose for a few weeks but now my nephew has it.

I generally don’t mind floor furniture but even Amazon floor couches seem costly.But this little mattress, for its price, is actually pretty decent! I mainly use it folded up in couch mode, the back cushion does kind of sink as the design folds so there’s no cushioning. But I found if you put a long narrow box against the wall on the floor, then line up the mattress against it, and let the back rest sit on the boxes, it doesn’t sink so far. Honestly for $80 it’s more comfortable than most second hand/goodwill couches ive dealt with.The mattress pads themselves are dense but squishy but two stacked on top of eachother creates a nice firm seat. Seriously, I’m a plus sized person and these cushions still support me well.It’s also pretty comfy as a bed. Had a few nights while sick that I just unfolded it and fell asleep watching tv.

I ordered the mattress late, having just gotten over covid I wasn't even sure if I'd be ok by the time they were to come so everything was on pause, and the order went in late. I ordered this because though I do have a cot I did not think it was going to be comfortable enough for my Mom and because she was not able to get upstairs to the guest bedroom she had to stay downstairs. The company immediately shipped right out, which I so appreciate, and though the mattress did not arrive the day they got here it DID arrive exactly the day it noted on the order sheet, and they tried to get it here as fast as possible. My Mom slept (or rather didn't sleep) on the cot the first night, was not very comfortable for her. This mattress showed up the next night, I set it on the sofa/coffee table square, which was exactly the width of the mattress, and two chairs for the end support, sounds awkward but I didn't want her to have to get down on the floor.

I haven't slept on the mattress, but I laid on in for a little while and it seemed comfy to me. I like how it folds up out of the way. :)My son and his girlfriend have been using the mattress for a little over a week now and they haven't complained. They started out with the mattress on our laminate floor. Before I bought this, I had read some comments about feeling the gaps between the sections of the mattress, so I asked them about it. They said if you have a smooth floor you may notice the mattress slipping and pulling apart so the gaps are more noticeable. My son and his girlfriend noticed it a little at first, but they got used to it and didn't notice it after they had been laying on it a while. They also noticed that if the mattress is on top of something that isn't slippery, like maybe carpet or in their case the suade-like top of an air mattress, the mattress won't slip apart as much. My son's girlfriend said the mattress is comfy, however she felt a little like she sank into it and could tell she was close to the floor when it was on the floor. My son thinks the mattress is comfy as well. They both like the mattress better on top of a raised queen air mattress, just for height since we don't have a bed frame, but they also both agreed it is better to sleep on this folding mattress long term than on just an air mattress.So far, this purchase has been well worth the cost, as it is serving its purpose well. My son is working from home and this is perfect for two adults to sleep on at night, then he can fold it away so he can use the space for his office during the day. :)I also bought a Milliard Carry Case for Tri-Fold Mattress, Fits up to 6 inch Queen (58 inches x 26 inches x 18 inches) storage bag to go along with this mattress but I haven't opened it to review it at this time. I will try to give an update when I do.

It is easy to open up all the way then fold the mattress and set it on top and zip the cover. You can even keep a basic mattress cover on the mattress when storing it away. My 78 year old mom slept on the folding mattress on top of a raised air mattress so it would be easier for her to get on and off the bed.

As a result, we’ve struggled with pull out couches and the bar in your back, countless blow up mattresses that deflate by morning or are cold, as well as folded over pillow tops used on the floor to meet the sleeping needs of 9 people under one roof. I finally broke down and bought this (yet another temporary bedding option) for Christmas this year after watching several review videos and reading great reviews on this product. We bought the Queen size hoping two people could fit. I liked the idea that it is easy to fold up or store when everyone goes home. Final decision: It was amazing! We used it for about a week and a total of 5 people slept on it (no more than two at a time) as people rotated in and out of the house. They all loved it. As one of the review videos shared, you can’t feel the gaps between the sections for some strange reason.Also, it is far firmer than I expected for a foam mattress, thankfully. I hate when I sink into a pillow top. I have back problems and need more support than that. This gave me plenty of back support.We let it breathe to “off-gas” one night so nobody would be worried about any strange foam smells and to let it fully expand. Frankly, nobody said anything about it on the second night so I’m not sure this is really a problem anyway for this product.The packaging offered a good tip to leave the end zippers open to allow it plenty of space to expand since it comes vacuum packed and super compressed in the delivery box. We zipped it up easily after it expanded and put sheets on it the 2nd night and off we went to bed!I wish I would have known about this sooner as we wasted tons of money over the years on products that never met our needs. I wish I would have started with this instead.Also, our 5’11” and 6’ boys did fine on this as well as it was sufficiently long for their bodies.We didn’t even bother folding it up during the day time.

The mattress is amazing. It is easy to carry and pack when moving and very comfortable. I have slept on it everyday for 3 or 4 years now, no problem. I put it on a wooden IKEA bedframe I bought separately and it is stable, comfortable, and firm.The main reason I got this mattress was because I wanted to sleep on something more firm (not too soft or cushy because I cannot wake up in the morning). Also, I hate spring mattresses, it hurts my back. This foam mattress works really well and it does not trap much heat or sink in! And an added benefit, it is roughly 20 lbs (twin size) and very easy to carry or transport around. It is easy for me to place or remove my sheets after/when washing. I think you can also directly put the mattress on the ground and it would still be comfortable even without any sheets. I also have the carry cover and using it helps me move the mattress very easily by myself. No trouble. Another thing I should say is I have moved 3 times including being in a different state and this mattress has stayed with me! 10/10 recommend.Lots of reviews say it is good for only a temporary or short-term guest bed but I use it as my permanent mattress! There have been no issues, no smell, no other issue in my 3-4 years of use.The only downside is the height (4 inch) is not very high so when I put it in my frame the bed is very low compared to a normal mattress. The blankets and sheets droop to the ground. I think you can also put memory foam mattress topper on top or something if that is an issue, or add a layer underneath. For me, it did not matter. I just have it directly on the wooden slacks of my bedframe.Would NOT recommend for someone who does not like firm mattresses and is looking for something cushy.

The top layer is a very soft memory foam. The bottom is a stiffer memory foam. I hate this a lot. One reason I was interested in this bed was it sounded like it\'d be a firm bed. It\'s not. It\'s squishy and soft and underneath is like a slowly deflating hammock sensation. If it weren\'t six inches thick I\'d be feeling ONLY floor. Air mattresses are much more comfortable.Two. The ""sheet"" that holds the three cusions can be unzippered and rezippered with relaive ease. The bottom and sides of the ""sheet"" is grey mesh. The top of the ""sheet"" is soft, white, and mattress-topper-looking-ish. I LOVE THIS SHEET A LOT. You can take the cushions out and change them around, which is almost a necessity because of the foam type used wanting to stay compressed. (You could maybe even replace the lower-quality foam with a better foam of the same size and shape, which I might try.)But that said, regular twin-sized sheets placed over the trifold ""sheet"" will not keep this bed ""together."" I can already tell that with more use, the cushions will separate a lot further. Something like an additional extra zippered sheet that goes over the trifold one, just the right size for this entire mattress, would have been a boon. It could have kept everything together tightly during the night.Three. The trifold capacity. Is just fantastic. You CAN prop it up just fine (and really should when it\'s not being used, it seems to help the foam recover slightly better from use, and this foam needs that extra help.) You can also make it into the softest marshmallow chair ever and sit on it and become alarmed over the next 15 minutes as you slowly descend farther and farther down to the floor D:Four. This bed... requires a lot of upkeep.When using it on the floor, even though the bed itself does not cause sweat, somehow condensation on the very bottom of the mattress forms every night. I thought this might be because of the floor being cool, so I put a closed-cell foam camping pad under the mattress to alleviate the issue. It did not alleviate the issue. The pad got damp instead of the floor was all. The problem is not due to sweating through six inches of foam. The foam above is bone dry. Maybe it\'s because the bed bottom does not have fabric, it has mesh, but it means an extra concern.In any case it\'s weird and I have been dealing with it by removing blankets, and pillows, and propping it up on its side, so the bottom gets air circulation, to dry during the day. Every. morning. It\'s not acceptable if my bed grows mold, period. Needless to say this is tiring. People in Japan who use futons may be used to this. I\'d rather be able to have my bed in its place and not have to make it up every single night and unmake it every single morning.You cannot put this mattress onto a bare frame if it\'s a frame with bars. It will just not work. You could put this mattress onto a twin XL frame upon which you had placed a separately purchased twin XL boxspring. Or if you got a piece of wood suitable for placing on top of a frame, it might be okay.On to other pros and cons.Cost analysis: Before purchasing, I compared the cost of this mattress to the cost of replacing a quality type of air matress I\'d been using. (Intex, 18"", twin size air mattress, with fiber-tech. Incidentally a wonderful camping bed. I tended to have to replace them 2-3 times a year with constant daily use but was always concerned about sharp objects) ...Should I get a year of functional use out of Milliard\'s bed, it\'d cost me close to replacing an 18"" Intex twin mattress with fibertech: 4.5 times. In other words, if I had to replace my durable, well made fiber-tech air mattresses once every three months, the cost would be similar to if I successfully manage one year using this Milliard\'s mattress. (Will this mattress hold up as comfortably as a decent air mattress for a year? After a month, I can tell you, the answer is: no. That foam could be much, MUCH better than it is.)Comfort comparison: The bed is very close to the floor, which makes getting up harder than getting up out of an 18"" air mattress. Even with 6 inches of foam altogether, the foam is far too soft. It does not provide a feeling of support, but it does succeed at cushioning the floor. Flat out, any air mattress that retains its air through the night, is twice as comfortable as this mattress is a month later. My back is starting to hurt using this mattress due to lack of support. Replacing the cushions with a quality and appropriate high-use foam isn\'t inexpensive, but I\'m looking into that as an option to be able to at least keep using the trifold ""sheet"" which I really do like.Durability Comparison: Hands down a foam mattress is aimply much more durable than any air mattress because you do not have to worry about punctures.Ease of moving it: Hands down this foam mattress is also much easier and convenient to move or put away than any air mattress. You do not have to deflate it. It is relatively light. It is less awkward to move around. It is NOT a static magnet for every speck of dust and every gross little piece of shed hair or pet fur that can collect on the floor no matter how hard to keep it clean, like the plastic bottoms of air mattresses.ll said, if the cushions were just more comfortable to sleep on (resting on them for 10 minutes is suitably comfortable, but after that you start to sink...), this would be a much better bed. I\'ve slept on plain old couch cushions that were significantly more comfortable for similarly long periods of time in the past, so I know it\'s possible. It\'s just that this is not that kind of foam.If the company offered just the trifold ""sheet"" as a base, and then options to customize what kind of foam would be put into it, this bed would be better. I\'m not sorry that I purchased it. But I hoped it would be MORE comfortable than an air mattress, without the risk of punctures, for a relatively similar price.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 21, 2019', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Super comfortable, compact mattress!', 'author': 'jougator', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""This mattress was exactly what I was looking for and exceeded my expectations!

It is very comfortable, my quality of sleep has improved and I have way less back and shoulder pain. Only thing I've been looking into is a cooling gel infused mattress topper because it's now the dead of summer and uncomfortably warm even at night.I bought this and it arrived at my doorstep within 5 days. Very convenient. Packaged neatly, compressed and delivered by UPS. Total came out to $358.37 which is cheap for a bed, I was questioning the quality but decided to go for it because Amazon's return policies are decent.I ordered this mattress, along with the ZINUS Arnav Modern Studio 10 Inch Platform 2000 Metal Bed Frame (which I also reviewed so it is now available on my profile), after the old mattress I’ve had since high school developed a crater so deep it was visible even when no one was on the bed. Even the box spring was flattened in the center so I decided I needed a whole new setup. I personally spent hours reviewing various mattresses, weighing pros and cons of memory foam vs. spring vs hybrids. I decided on this hybrid mattress from AmazonBasics because I trust the brand a bit more than some of the unfamiliar online-only ones, and I chose hybrid because before this I had a pillow top spring mattress so I wasn’t sure I’d like a 100% foam bed. This mattress is firm without being too hard, it’s comfortable and the motion isolation claims are true, especially for a couple like myself and my spouse who previously had a spring mattress and felt every movement. It is nice being able to turn over without waking each other. The price is very good for the quality and honestly I’d recommend purchasing this bed, I don’t feel like this mattress will have any issues with indenting. However I will be back to update my review especially if anything goes wrong. Also I’d recommend purchasing a mattress protector, I have one on the way. The foam seems like it’d be absorbent and I’d rather not damage it with accidental spills.I think I made a good choice. Overall the process was easy, unbox and unwrap the mattress on the frame or wherever you choose to keep it because it’s easier that way. Personally I think my mattress was full after about 2 hours or so, we slept on it that night with no problems. I ordered the 12 inch / queen version so it’s definitely higher up than I’m used to, but I enjoy how much easier it is to get in and out of bed with the height.I’m comfortable, I slept well, no weird aches or pains, but with the shape that my last mattress was in, anything is an improvement. I fully believe I made a good choice with this bed, as comfortable and well made as it appears. I am a guy in my early 20s though so there was no struggle for me to pick up the box and since it was delivered to my doorstep I just had to drag it down the hallway to my room, where I eagerly tore open packaging like a child on Christmas day, only for this thing to spring open and the impact was like an air-bag. Don’t open it the way I did - watch a video on opening them and for best results, lay it in your bed frame before opening it.TL;DR Freshly ordered and set up, so far so good. No noxious odors, no issues with quality or damage, very comfortable. Will be back to update as time progresses. First night of sleep went really well.

After realizing our old Serta had a bit of a sink hole - we decided to get a new mattress before chalking up the aches and pains to getting older.After a good bit of research and working within our budget - this Amazon mattress looked like it would fit the bill. We’ve never had a memory foam but have the slept on them before. We live in a climate that runs 100-115 degrees in the summer. Memory foam is usually too warm for us (even in the winter they make me hot). So we opted to try out the hybrid. We liked the idea of memory foam for our joints but wanted some support from some springs.Delivery Day: It puffed up pretty quickly after removing the plastic and the out gassing wasn’t particularly bothersome to either one of us. It smelled new sure but it wasn’t that bad.Trying it out: Our first couple nights were actually kind of weird. It was firmer than I thought it would be and we were pretty used to our 20 year old mattress so it took a second to get used to not laying in a hole? 😂 But the first night we both woke up with fewer aches. And by day 3, pretty much no aches and we were reveling in how soft something so firm could feel when sleeping on it.We got this mattress in Nov 2021. It is now almost May 2022 and unlike some reviewer complaints - we’ve not had any issue with the mattress denting or caving in. It still looks pretty much like it did when we got it. I weigh about 140 and my husband weighs about 180 - neither of our sides have dents. We have rotated it once since we’ve had it (just swapped what was the head end).It does run warm. Not as warm as full memory foam mattress. But it still runs warm. In the winter it’s actually fantastic. We haven’t tried it in the summer but we’ve already begun to see some warmer temps and I’ve found less blankets and lighter weight clothes was all we needed to adjust to manage the warmer mattress.I’ll try to update my review after a year has gone by.

It was a great mattress but had to go and while shopping around the prices are all over the board for what seems like the same product. One day at Costco I saw a mattress selling for almost $1800 and after trying it I was about to buy it but told my self to go home and do some research and that's how I came across this bed as I do purchase a lot from Amazon.You will find everyone giving mixed reviews about most mattresses because we all have our own preferences when sleeping.With that being said I prefer a medium firmness and am a side sleeper with sleeping issues that I have had for decades. Anyway knowing it's Amazon and if it's not good for whatever reason I could return it so I pulled the trigger and bought this bed. I was anxious to get it and was amazed that it fit in such a small box but it was heavy. I managed to get the king sized mattress upstairs and opened it up and in amazent watched it expand. I know they say it takes 48-72 hours to fully expand but mine was fine in 8 hours.The mattress does have a slight smell like most memory foam beds do, my kids beds had it as well and theirs were from a major brand. Anyway I left my windows open for the day and closed it at bed time and have to say there was still a smell to the bed that night. It eventually went away after 3 days.Now for sleeping on it, it took me a day or two to get used to it and following that it has been the best night's sleep I have ever gotten. It is firm when you get in and then it conforms to your shape and let me say no back pains, like I had in my last bed. Unlike standard memory foam this has not trapped the heat and kept me comfortable and given me great support from head to toe.Is this comparable to a casper mattress, I can't say but it's one heck of a bed at an amazing price with Amazon backing it up.It has just been a few weeks now so I can't state how it will do over the years but I will provide an update in a few months.Again for the money you can't find anything comparable out there and it seems to be built well."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States March 1, 2020', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Best mattress EVER!

Make sure the room you are putting this thing in is WARM!! - This helps air in the memory foam expand quicker, which alongside the pocketed coils can shorten prep-time to 24-48hrs.2. Rotate your mattress 180-degrees WEEKLY!! (most important) - It is important to rotate these mattresses more often than not the first month or two in order to reduce the chance of uneven sinking. It will also help to even out the expected ""setting"" of the coils, which might look light slight sagging.Other than that, it feels great!! It isn\'t marshmallow soft but not brick hard.

Here\'s a brief review based on my observations:First and foremost, the price point for this mattress is quite attractive, especially considering the product\'s quality. It\'s a budget-friendly option for those in need of a new mattress without breaking the bank.When it comes to moving and positioning the mattress, it\'s worth noting that it\'s surprisingly heavy due to its compact and dense nature. While this might pose a bit of a challenge during setup, once it\'s in place, the process is relatively straightforward.The firmness of the mattress is a notable feature. It\'s excellent for reducing backaches, particularly if you\'ve been struggling with a softer, less supportive mattress. However, for some, it may lean a bit too much towards the firm side. I personally found it necessary to add a 3"" mattress topper to achieve a more optimal level of comfort. This adjustment made it nearly perfect in terms of support and comfort, although it still retained some firmness.In conclusion, the Vibe Heather Grey 10” Gel Memory Foam Mattress in a King size offers a good balance between price and quality. It provides substantial support and relief from backaches, making it a solid choice for those in need of a firmer sleeping surface. However, if you prefer a softer feel, be prepared to invest in a mattress topper to customize your comfort level. Overall, it\'s a decent mattress that caters to various preferences and sleep needs.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 18, 2023', 'is_verified': False}]"

Hearing that I could possibly receive a defective product and be left having to deal what would likely be a nightmare to return, didn\'t really inspire a lot of confidence. But I clicked the buy button anyway and I\'m glad I did!The product arrives in two pieces, tightly rolled up, and put in a box. I\'ll admit, I was worried when I opened the box and rolled the pads out and noticed how different in shape they were to each other... it really did look like I was given two different sizes. But, knowing how finnicky memory foam can be, I took them outside and let them lay out in the sun for a few hours. It wasn\'t very warm outside, but I imagine the higher the temperature is, the quicker the foam will gain its proper shape. Unfortunately, with the foam being white, it won\'t absorb the light from the sun and heat up on it\'s own.A few hours later I went to check on them and they had fully gained their shape. I placed them on my box spring and threw my mattress on top. I was half-expecting the foam to give when I got on the bed, but it didn\'t even seem to give at all. Just to put things into perspective, my mattress is not light. It\'s a hybrid mattress with springs and memory foam and it\'s very thick. I am also not very light as I weight 280 pounds. These pieces of foam can hold some weight!So why did I purchase this? I got tired of feeling all stuffy and unable to breathe through my nose every night when I laid down because blood flow to the upper part of my body increases. I\'ve also been told that I sometimes snore and thought this might help that. It took a little getting used to, but this product has made a big improvement.One important thing you may want to consider is how firm your bed is you\'re going to go for the 7"".

We decided on a full-size bed but needed a comfortable mattress that would accommodate the adult body and toddler body.Pros:1. Packaging. The mattress came in vacuumed packaging and seemed small at first. I will admit that for a brief second after opening the bag, I had my doubts that this would be 12 inches thick as advertised. I was wrong. This mattress is 12 inches thick and maybe even a little over. Amazingly, it was so well packaged despite its size.2. Size. After opening the mattress, be sure to let it sit for a few hours to let it expand to its full size and potential. As you can see in the pictures, it is quite thick.3. Comfort. My daughter is used to the hard mattress in her crib which is what was recommended for infant cribs. My old body prefers a mattress with some plush and softness. The foam allows a decent amount of firmness but remains easy on the back. The mattress underneath my body does not heat up like other foam mattresses that I have slept on. It also allows me to sneak out of bed after she falls asleep without causing too much motion or shake which would wake her up since she is a very light sleeper.4. Cover. There is a cover on the mattress that looks like it might be possible to remove with zipper although I have not tried to remove it. The cover itself is very soft and I have slept on it without sheets. It does not appear to be waterproof, so I recommend getting a waterproof cover to protect your mattress if your toddler sleeps on it.Cons:I don’t see a con to this at all except that it’s relatively heavy but that’s probably because it is a high-quality mattress.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 9, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars I’ve fallen in love (and asleep)', 'author': 'Anonymous', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'This is my first memory foam mattress, and tbh I had trepidation in buying it.

This is my 5th memory foam type mattress in a box from various companies. The mattress is surprisingly plush for a memory foam. It's pretty soft as you lay on it, then as soon as you've sunk in a bit it gets a little more firm and supportive. You can't sit on the very edge of the bed because it has no support at the edge and will just melt under you. I like my mattresses softer so I was very pleased with the plush feel. This one is definitely in my top 2. The only other memory foam bed I think is better is from Bed-in-a-Box website (like the original bed in a box memory foam mattress people).Unfortunately, we had to return this mattress because the company has not figured out how to properly label their mattresses for fulfillment. I ordered and needed the 12 inch mattress, however, the mattress only expanded to 10 inches. But it is fully expanded. NO WHERE on the external shipping box, the labels on the mattress itself or the included instruction manual did it reference what size mattress you have received. I assumed we received a queen size because there was a 'Q' at the end of some random numbers on the shipping box. But that was a guess. It was indeed a queen but there was no way of telling how tall it would expand to. I have no doubt that the 12 inch mattress would have been perfect, but I don't think Amazon fulfillment could even decipher what sizes they are sending out to people. So, I think the real issue people are having is not that the mattress is not expanding to full size, but that they received the wrong size mattress to begin with but you have no way of knowing what size it will be until you break open that shrink wrap. If you're getting the 10 inch, you'll probably be fine because that's what they're sending out. If you need 12 inches for your frame like we do, then you might be rolling the dice. If I knew we would for sure get the 12 inch mattress I would have reordered, but again, the labeling/packing provides NO information on what is actually inside. So, we'll have to pass.Otherwise- nice material, no weird chemical smell, expanded to full 10 inches pretty quickly, and the feel was soft and plush.

My husband brought it upstairs by himself. The box was a manageable size for 1 person. The mattress was folded in half, head to toe, then rolled up tight and shrink wrapped. There was an envelope opener tool taped to the side. I highly recommend using this tool over scissors or other sharp objects so you don\'t accidentally cut into the mattress cover. You only need to carefully slice through one layer of plastic, then you just unroll the remaining layers. The mattress cover was nice and clean. No odors or off-gassing smells detected (and I have a sensitive nose).Set up: Admittedly the matress looks pretty sad and flat immediately upon unwrapping. DON\'T BE ALARMED! It will expand. At this point, make sure the matress is on a flat surface where it can expand freely without any pressure or pinch points. We unwrapped ours around 7pm. Within 3-4 hours, the mattress had risen to 10."" By morning, it was at the full 12."" The corners were nice and square. We then positioned it into place on the bed frame and made the bed.The bed frame we used is a metal frame with round metal pole type ""slats"" for a base. The metal head and footboards kept the mattress from shifting around. It\'s a nice and snug fit. No gaps.Comfort: When I assembled the bed frame, I was a little concerned I might be able to feel the round metal slats through the matress. I\'ve never had a foam mattress before. I\'m happy to report that was not an issue. Can\'t feel them at all. If you\'re worried at all about the mattress being folded head to toe for shipping, don\'t be. It lays completely flat and I can\'t even tell it was ever folded now that it rebounded/expanded.I would describe the mattress as medium firm. At first it feels firm, then the matress gives way to your body\'s pressure points and it feels just right, neither firm nor plush. With memory foam, there\'s no bounce like spring mattresses can have, which also means there\'s no movement when your partner moves. With 2 people, we did not experience any rolling toward the center. I\'ve also laid near the edge and had no problems with edge collapse.I\'m super pleased with this purchase so far. Too soon to tell yet how it will hold up longterm, but since this is for a guest room, and based on my initial impression of the product, I\'m not worried.Only bummer was 3 days after delivery, the price dropped 29%, which would\'ve made this an absolute steal of a deal. Even the regular price is a bargain.I would not hesitate to buy again.EDITED TO ADD: We bought a 2nd mattress. Our teen wanted to upgrade from a twin to a double, so we bought another. She loves it.

It has needed replacing and i spend a few hours reading reviews and investigating my options. I knew i wanted a more firm mattress due to my previous experience and that the toppers usually break in reducing the level of firmness. I slept my first night on the bed last night. It is probably the most firm bed I have ever had. Its not bad but I am aware I am getting used to it. I could sleep on my stomach and not have my lower back hurt which has been a problem with medium to soft beds. My shoulders were not crammed up to my ears; again a problem with softer beds and I didn\'t wake up with shoulder pain or numb arms which has been an issue since old bed has been needing replaced. I did notice there is some give in the topper/memory foam but definitely not as much as my other bed. I can lay there move my leg and feel an impression which also expands back within seconds. My only issue is my lower back was hurting very minorly after my sleep BUT i have been go go go with chores and lifting and moving and my back also hurt worse in my old bed. I do know my body will need to adjust to the new level of firmness so I am not going ot say my back pain is due to the bed. I will have to wait a few weeks and see. Overall, I love the bed so much more than my other one and am already happy about the changes I see I do hope once I let my body rest and adjust to the bed my back will be fine. Otherwise that is my only concern and I wish i had bought a replacement bed much sooner.1 Week in and I notice my body has adjusted. I feel like i sleep deeper, my husband doesn\'t wake me flopping around like a fish in his sleep. I don\'t wake up with any pain. I do notice the bed is cooler and I find myself actually getting cold so I don\'t have to have the AC on anymore.

I’ve had many memory-foam mattresses/“bed in a box” kits over the years. What appealed to me about this one was the price and that it’s fiberglass-free.UNPACKING ITHubby and I opened the mattress at 4:00 pm and closely inspected it — no mold or dirt. Whew. Looked totally clean. I have allergies and am a STICKLER about clean mattresses. Had I seen a smudge of anything remotely suspect, I would have immediately returned it. I was horrified by the stories from other reviewers about finding mold (and then being told by the company that it was “just dirt” — equally unacceptable!), and honestly I was expecting the worst. I literally tried to cancel my order twice, but Amazon refused because it had already shipped. Fortunately, to my great relief, the mattress arrived 100% clean. And believe me, I inspected every inch of the thing.As part of my inspection, I checked the fabric and stitching all the way around. I saw no open seams or loose threads. The zippers ran smoothly.There was no smell at all once we got it out of the packaging. Memory foam mattresses have a very recognizable odor (if you’ve had one, you know) and usually off-gas for a few days. This one had a faint odor ONLY during the five minutes we were removing the plastic packaging. (And honestly, a lot of products do that if they’ve been cooped up in plastic wrap for a time.) It went away immediately.FIBERGLASS DOUBLE-CHECKI unzipped the cover a few inches — gingerly at first — to confirm that the mattress is indeed fiberglass-free, as advertised. THANK GOD. The slabs of foam are held together by a knit “sock” that clearly does not contain fiberglass because it is matte and has no shiny bits, nor did it shed any fibers. It appears to be a cotton-poly blend. See my attached photo.This means the cover is washable! (To be clear, I’m talking about the *zippered cover*, not the inner sock.) Although I don’t personally need to wash the cover — because I use an allergen-proof mattress encasement — I can see how having the option to wash it could be useful.HEIGHTWe set the mattress on the bed frame, and two hours later, it had plumped up to 8"".Twenty-four hours later, it had only plumped up to 9"", and one of the corners by the footboard was still a bit crumpled.At this point now (a week into it, at the time I’m writing this review), I’m not sure it will ever fully inflate to the stated 10"". Not a huge deal, though, as I only ordered this mattress as an emergency stopgap until we can buy a nicer one locally.FIRMNESSEveryone’s perception will be different, but on a scale of 1-10, where 1=plush (squishmallow) and 10=firm (plank of wood), this mattress feels to me like an 8. It’s quite firm. I honestly wasn’t expecting this. All of my memory foam mattresses over the years have been a ~5 (fairly cushy), so I assumed this one would be too.Despite my reservations about its firmness, I have slept VERY well on this mattress over the past week. No pain, zero complaints. I don’t normally go for firm mattresses, but I may be a convert now. LOL.FINAL THOUGHTSOverall this is an excellent mattress if you have a smaller budget and want to avoid the dreaded fiberglass sock. Despite its minor drawbacks, for the price, it’s a perfectly acceptable mattress.** UPDATE, four days later **The crumpled corner has fixed itself, but the mattress is still only 9"" tall.** UPDATE, two weeks later: Rating increased to 5 stars **I changed the bed linens today and, for craps & cackles, measured the height of the mattress again. It’s at 10"" now. I was shocked that it actually got there. I’m still loving the firmness and have been waking up blessedly pain-free. I’ve increased my rating to five stars.** UPDATE, three months later, January 2023 **I am IN LOVE with this mattress. I don’t think I’ll bother buying a different one locally, as this “stopgap” mattress has exceeded all my expectations.I noticed the manufacturer is now, at the time of this update, offering more variations of this mattress than were available when I bought it. There are now “firm” options.My best guess is that the mattress I bought & received is the “firm” variety, and they are selling a new, softer mattress slotted into the plain “8/10/12-inch” categories.Why do I think this?Because I cannot imagine how a memory foam mattress could possibly be firmer than mine without either defying the laws of physics or being a slab of literal stone.If we end up ordering a new mattress for the guest room, you can bet we’ll buy this one again, and I’ll report back and either confirm or refute my theory about the new “firm” variety.** UPDATE, six months after original review, April 2023 **WE DID IT: We bought the exact same mattress, 10"" gray, for the guest room — and my theory was right!The new mattress is softer, about a 6 on the 1-10 firmness scale.It also plumped up WAY faster than the original one, probably because it’s less dense. The height measured 8.5"" a mere 30 minutes after opening and reached the full 10"" by the next day. All four corners were immediately crisp with no crumpling. The cover was clean & pristine on all sides. No odor. We are extremely pleased!Our original mattress is still phenomenal. Zero complaints. Would buy again in a heartbeat.I can confidently give my full endorsement of this mattress, both the “firm” and “not firm” varieties.May you have restful and pain-free sleep, my friend.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 7, 2022', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Even better than I had hoped!', 'author': 'Traci', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I’m usually not one to leave reviews but this mattress….. I love it! I wanted to give it a couple weeks before reviewing but I was satisfied the first night we slept on it.For reference, I purchased the 12” Blue Firm king size mattress. I got my first memory foam mattress right at the the time “bed in a box” options first started to pop up online. That initial mattress nearly made me avoid memory foam entirely. It was a “medium-firm” 14” king size and it was TERRIBLE. It was dipping within the first week. And my husband and I were much smaller people at the time. Hip and back pain became a constant companion but it was quite pricy and we were trying to make it work. A couple weeks ago I simply had enough. It was time to look at other options.I couldn’t find much that wasn’t memory foam though. Over the years I purchased other memory foam mattresses for our boys and I found them quite comfy so I figured maybe we’d have better luck trying a different firmness or maybe design had come a long way since we bought ours. I read through reviews for days before landing on the Molblly brand. I was still a little unsure on which firmness to get because some reviews said the medium firm was too firm. Others said too soft. The reviews were equally mixed on the firm mattresses.Ultimately I decided to go with firm for more support to help with my pain and figured I could always put a topper on it to add extra softness.The mattress was here within 48 hours. I immediately unboxed it to expand. It was much firmer than our previous mattress but again, there was the topper option if that turned out to be a problem. It was MUCH lighter than my previous mattress too. I was a little worried at first that it had only expanded 9” in 12 hours but based on other memory foam mattresses I’ve purchased I knew I needed to trust the process. Besides, in my experience, memory foam can expand up to an inch off so as long as it hit 11” I would be satisfied.72 hours later and it expanded to around 11.75”! Perfect. When I first laid on it I immediately thought “uh oh” as it was FIRM. Plusher than the floor but pretty firm all the same but…. Trust the process.That first night’s sleep it was pretty clear that while this was indeed a much firmer mattress than the one I had, it was also incredibly comfortable. I can’t explain it but after you lay down a few minutes it gets a bit softer as it molds to your pressure points. It was the best nights sleep I had in YEARS. No topper needed. Over the last week I’ve also noticed my back and hips are less sore. My husband also saw a reduction in headaches he had been waking up with a couple times a week too.I can’t speak to longevity yet but it seems to be a higher quality than my previous mattress. And you can’t beat the price.Speaking of price, I had purchased the mattress on Saturday during Labor Day weekend. I figured any holiday sales would be up already so just bought it. I didn’t want to wait ;) but when I hopped on to check my order that Monday to check tracking I noticed it was marked down $45 less than what I had paid less than two days before.Totally my fault as I shouldn’t have assumed there wasn’t a sale planned for Monday but I figured it wouldn’t hurt to contact the company.

We ended up buying a 3 inch foam topper and it still feels pretty firm but at least I no longer feel pain.

I took the advice from another reviewer and I gave those two corners some heavy massage in hopes they will plump up. Time will tell if they get to 14''. This wasn't a huge issue for me I just put those two corners at the top of my bedframe (where you lay your head) and I am hoping for the best!I did have some snagged threads on the mattress cover that I have addressed with the manufacture so ill update if anything is done about that as well.As far as sleeping I went from a super old memory foam pillow top mattress that had horrible sinking spots from being slept on that was extremely plush from old age.

I’ve owned a handful of them over the years.When my last Beautyrest started sagging I started looking into hybrid bed in a box type beds like Purple and Casper. I ultimately purchased a Dreamcloud, it was their top of the line mattress at the time and it was close to $2K when I purchased it.The Dreamcloud was a serious disappointment. It was sagging within a month. Based on the reviews, I’m not sure if I had a bad one or they’re overpriced junk. Regardless, it was a complete fail and I overspent on something that didn’t live up to the hype.After the Dreamcloud experience I swore I would never do the bed in a box thing again.Never say never.I recently found myself in a situation where I needed a bed and budget was important. I did a ton of researching, read a lot of reviews and decided to roll the dice on this mattress. I purchased the 12” Queen.As others have stated, the box is heavy. I was able to get it into the house and onto the bed myself but it is a heavy mattress and I would recommend having a helper.The mattress pops up fast once you open the plastic packaging. Mine was fully up within an hour but I let it decompress for 2 days before sleeping on it. The corners were fully up and everything was set after 2 days.This is a very comfortable mattress. This mattress is not as firm as I had hoped it would be initially but I’ve quickly realized it doesn’t have to be very firm. The mattress provides a lot of support. I don’t wake up stiff and I don’t toss and turn while I’m sleeping. I rest and I rest well.The edge support on this mattress is solid when it comes to the sides. The foot and head edge support are a bit disappointing but for the price of this mattress I am happily overlooking that issue.I like this mattress so much I just bought one for my mother and another for my son.This isn’t a Beautyrest but it’s a lot better than my overpriced Dreamcloud and it’s a fraction of the price.You can’t go wrong with this mattress.

My back and posture are improved and no pain. I also got a gel neck pillow for my neck. Sweet dreams.I researched mattresses thoroughly before buying this mattress. I even read all of the reviews. I was prepared to do this and do it correctly.First, the box arrived and for a King it is well over 100 lbs. I read it was about 85 lbs. but that obviously was for a smaller mattress. It took me over an hour just to get it through the front door. Then it was pretty easy to ""walk"" it along the laminate flooring into the bedroom.Second, I watched several videos of ""bed in a box"" type mattresses and they easily slide the box up and over the top. So, I tipped the box over, cut the bottom flaps, opened the flaps, and tipped it back up. The flaps were under the box still, so I ripped the box to shreds.Third, I leaned it on the bed frame and picked up the other end and got it on the bed.Fourth, I read the instructions, which weren\'t very detailed. But it clearly said on the protective film which way it would unroll and an arrow pointing in that direction. Fine, so I have to get the protective film off, and the only way was to roll the tube a little so I could get under it to unwrap it. I did, all the while, keeping an eye on that arrow.And then, POOF, it flipped out and inflated. Voila! it was perfectly laid out on the bed frame . . . except that it was upside down. I spent the next 2 hours trying to flip it over but without success. I finally called a neighbor, and he helped me get it back right-side up. Not sure where exactly I went wrong . . . but don\'t do that.I slept like a baby that night and have had great sleep since. I hope that continues because I love this mattress. It\'s not too soft, nor too firm for me. I\'m a side sleeper with a tricky back so I need both but not too much of one or the other. Getting out of bed is easy with the edges being very supportive.

Our old mattress was starting to cause us back problems though and this one had a lot of good reviews. Also it could be delivered in a short time window which we really needed.It arrived and we laid it out for 3 days (72 hours) to 'fluff' and air out as recommended. The usual chemical smells that come with the compressed packaging used faded after the first day and it was mostly returned to natural size about the same time but we waited for the full amount to be sure. When we finally got it on our bed we were delighted. Slept great for several nights in a row.The good continued for about a month after which the middle of the mattress had started to sag a bit. This is common with larger mattresses though it usually takes longer. At that point it wasn't too bad needing only a thin pad to counter and we assumed it was stable. At least it seemed not to sag any more over the next couple of months. The return date approached and I didn't think twice about it.Less than a month later I was wishing the return date hadn't already passed. We have now slept on the mattress for less than 6 months and are getting the worst sleep we have ever had. We both wake up in pain often as pressure points in the mattress are impossible to avoid. Several times a night I'll have to shift positions to 'wake up' an arm or leg and the minor hip problems I'd had on the old mattress are major ones on this one. The good sleep we had gotten on the mattress in the first month are a distant memory and we are searching once again for a replacement.In summary, this mattress may be fine in the smaller sizes and could work well on a guest bed where it isn't used nightly. But if you are looking for a king or cal king mattress to sleep on regularly shop elsewhere. And don't be fooled by the seemingly long return window.

It solved all of my sleep problems like magic! I’ve been having insomnia for the past 6 months.. and I absolutely had no idea that the roots of my sleep issues were coming from my bed. My previous mattress was a gel memory foam mattress. I found an immediate relief the very first night I changed my mattress with this new one. In the next couple of nights my old sleep pattern began to change. This mattress is very different than my old memory foam. It is a very solid and heavy mattress. And it is bouncy. It feels luxurious and high quality, my body got quickly accustomed to the feeling of the surface texture which consists of these soft cushions. I bought a few different types of mattress protectors for it because I wasn’t sure which one it would need. I chose a thin and tight-fitting one with no extra padding because as I mentioned before my body really likes the feeling of the cushion texture that is on the top of the mattress. The mattress came rolled up and vacuumed in a box. It was heavy. It came with a special little cutter tool to carefully cut the plastic instead of using a knife/scissors. It took some time to enroll it, position it and let it expand fully. There is something really important about this mattress that gives me a peace of mind - - it is non-toxic. It comes with a tag that says it’s been “Certipur-US certified” - which means that this mattress is made without: mercury, lead, formaldehyde, ozone depleters, heavy metals, and other carcinogenic chemicals.

The combination of memory foam and individually wrapped coils provides the perfect blend of support and contouring to my body. I wake up feeling refreshed and without any aches or pains. It's like sleeping on a cloud!The cooling gel feature is a real game-changer, especially for someone like me who tends to get hot during the night. The gel-infused foam works wonders in regulating the temperature, keeping me cool and sweat-free throughout the night. I no longer have to toss and turn, searching for a cool spot on the bed.In terms of quality, the ZINUS 10 Inch Comfort Support Cooling Gel Hybrid Mattress is top-notch. The construction feels solid and durable, and the stitching is flawless. Additionally, the mattress comes with a 10-year warranty, which is a testament to the manufacturer's confidence in their product.Another standout feature is the motion isolation. My partner's movements during the night no longer disturb my sleep, thanks to the individually wrapped coils that absorb and minimize motion transfer. It's truly a blessing for light sleepers or those who share their bed with a restless partner.Setting up the mattress was a breeze. It arrived conveniently compressed in a box, and once unboxed and placed on the bed frame, it expanded to its full size within a few hours. No hassle, no fuss!One minor downside worth mentioning is the initial off-gassing smell that is common with most memory foam mattresses. However, it dissipates within a day or two, and I haven't noticed any lingering odor since.Overall, I highly recommend the ZINUS 10 Inch Comfort Support Cooling Gel Hybrid Mattress to anyone in search of a luxurious and supportive sleep experience.

April 6, 2019:The mattress is still going strong. I know it's been only 6 months, but with previous mattresses we've had over the years, none of them made it past the 6-month mark before showing wear. So I believe this is a good sign.Original review: For the last year I've had insomnia due to my chronic pain from Lupus and because our old memory foam mattress apparently had amnesia. I spent over 30 hours ( spread out over several days) researching all kinds of mattresses, and everything one should know about them. I'm considering myself an expert now. Hehe. For our situation, based on everything that is out there, I decided we needed a latex and pocketed spring hybrid, which led me to two choices: this one and one on another website that cost $1700 and who's return policy was questionable. Or course we decided to try out this one. Funny and sad thing is that this was the first mattress that I saw in my research journey. I could have spared myself the 30+ hours of research.We needed a mattress that would sleep cool. I kept burning up at night with our old one. It's not fun. My research led me to two things that keep a mattress cool: latex and pocketed coils. So then I researched which types have the best support. My husband weighs 280 pounds, which is hard on mattresses, especially memory foam. Again, my research led me to latex and pocketed coils. They offered what we needed, soft feeling, but firm. We could have gone straight latex, from what I was reading, but that was very expensive, and my husband was convinced we needed coils because of his weight. Side support was another issue we were hoping to remedy. This mattress offers excellent side support. Sometimes I have to sleep on the side to let my arm hang over because of nerve issues, I can do that with this one and not feel like I'm going to fall off.Our previous mattress, a pure memory foam, failed us within a year. I think we might be partially responsible for that as we did not wait more than a few hours to lay on it because my husband refused to wait. It never rose completely. He kept measuring the sides only on that one, that had reached the desired measurement of 11-inches, but did not care about the head and foot of the mattress that was not anywhere near the required 11-inches. Well, my latest research suggests that all memory foam mattresses need to be aired out the entire duration recommended by the manufacturers to extend their longetivity. Once we lay on them, if they did not reach their full height, they never will. He was fussed at and educated by me on how his decision cost us, so he did not give me a hard time on the 48-hour wait with this mattress. In fact, I've been in so much pain, I was the one willing to cave on the recommended wait time about 24 hours in, but he put his foot down. LOL. So please, with whatever mattress you end up getting, wait the recommended time, even if it looks high enough. It's worth the wait.Onto what we think about this mattress...Let me first explain my situation, I've just recently been diagnosed with Lupus. For the last few years I've been on a steady decline in health and went from occasional pain, to all over massive pain accompanied by migraines, and now a lovely rash. I have nerve pain all over, fibromyalsia, arthritis, etc. I hurt 24/7. I just recently had to start walking with a cane. I'm just a little overweight, and until two years ago, I was doing 5k's three times a week. The last few months were unbearable. The pain and our old bed made it hard for me to get even 3 hours sleep. That would be a good night. This amazing Lucid mattress has changed my life. I'm getting a good 7+ hours sleep now, which for me is a miracle! I would probably get more sleep, but nerve pain still wakes me up, but not as bad. I've never slept in a bed as comfortable as this one. Ever. It even sleeps cool! My husband's snoring is almost non-existent now. He is sleeping soundly now. (Probably because I am. LOL.) We have no complaints so far. We just hope it gives us at least 5 years. If it does, we'll consider it money well spent.When we first rested on our LUCID 12-Inch King Latex Hybrid Mattress we said, wow, this is soft. Yet, we did not sink into the mattress and it really supported us. We are stomach and side sleepers. But I've tried out every position on this mattress, and really you can't go wrong. It's comfy no matter how you sleep. It's not too soft or too hard. It's just right for all of us Goldilocks sleepers. No pressure on joints or our back. It feels amazing. We can even cuddle again! Our old mattress couldn't handle that, leaving us feeling like we were slipping into a sinkhole. In this bed we can cuddle all we want.You've seen other pictures of what the mattress looks like, so I just included what ours looks like made up, and pictures of the condition of the box it arrived it. As you can see, the box arrived all battered up. It looks like UPS did their best to tape it up to keep it together. I want you to see these pictures because if you order this bed and it arrives this way, I don't want you to have the small heartattack I had. The mattress was so well wrapped inside of the box, it was unscathed. So fear not.From what I read it's best to have cotton sheets and a bedspread that is cotton, to help with keeping cool, with any type of bed. The best sheets I've found are at Sam's Club, their $40-$50 brand. They are wrinkle free, soft and silky, and feel just heavenly. They get softer every time you wash them and last for years. We just purchased the oversized king bedspread as seen in the picture, here on Amazon. It's another amazing find. It completely covers your bed so you do not need a bedskirt, which is helpful when rotating your memory foam mattress. You will find my review for this amazing bedspread when you click my name here, if you are searching for one. The manufacturer of our bedspread has other patterns/colors.I will update this review on how well this bed holds up. As of right now, we've only had this mattress a month. I'm good about updating my reviews, so we'll see how this dream mattress holds up and I'll let you know. Fingers crossed!

These are exceptional times we are living thru and the mattress took over a week to arrive which is OK, ordered on 4/16, but for ""some"" reason, UPS scanned this item into San Diego (where I live) on Fri, 4/24... b/c of ""circumstances beyond our control"", UPS did NOT make delivery until Mon, 4/27... Like many other reviews who stated that their ""package"" arrived with a pretty beat-up box, my ""Package"" arrived with no box, no shipping manifest, no invoice, no warranty information, no ""handy package opener"" (letter opener), I debated whether to accept the package - just a mattress wrapped in plastic in a tube-like form. After several minutes of consideration, I accepted delivery b/c I didn\'t want to wait an additional 2 weeks...Once inside... It\'s quite heavy, about 110 lbs, by myself, it took some effort to navigate into my bedroom because my apartment is tiny and with my furniture, there is little room to maneuver, but that\'s my problem... Once I got it set up, I had the ""package opener"" left from a previous Lucid 4"" Gel-infused memory foam mattress topper - more on that later... Once I sliced the packaging open, the mattress ""unfolded"" just like many of the unboxing videos you can watch on YouTube. Just like in all of those videos, the mattress unfolded upside down - must be a manufacturing issue when they package the mattress at the factory (in Turkey and not China! I\'m not sayin\' that\'s bad, it\'s good that not everything comes from China!). Another massive effort to get the mattress flipped over into it\'s proper configuration and it was set. It would be nice if Lucid could get the manufacturer to package the mattress in such a way that when you slice open the plastic, it opens ""right-side up""... just sayin\'...There was no noticeable off-gassing, mattress smelled neutral right of it\'s compressed wrapping. It quickly achieved it\'s 12"" height, I left it sit for about 4 hours before actually sitting down on it... just kidding... no I didn\'t, I sat/laid down on it immediately, but left the room and left it alone for several hours after that. Coming back into the room, there was no noticeable smell, although I kept my ceiling fan on high the entire time with the windows open.Delivery and setup aside... This mattress is FIRM... I\'m 6\'4"", 180 lbs... it is bouncy, just like all the YouTube videos, but it\'s pretty firm, I\'m still getting used to it. Fortunately, as mentioned previously, I purchased a 4"" Gel-infused memory foam topper last year from Lucid to try and make my old mattress last just a little bit longer - it worked, I loved the topper for the year I used it prior to taking delivery of the 12"" Latex Hybrid (which included the handy ""package-opener"" which I still happened to have!). Although it\'s an extra $100, I really do like the deep, sink-in, feeling of the memory foam topper. If I didn\'t have the topper, I\'m not sure if I would like this mattress...Although it wasn\'t necessary, I placed the mattress on top of the box spring I had left over from my old mattress - BIG mistake, the bed sat way too high, couldn\'t see my alarm clock, couldn\'t set my feet on the ground if I sat on the edge (and I\'m 6\'4""!)... Decided I needed to get rid of the box spring, had to get a friend to come over to help with the ""repositioning"" due to the confined space...Overall... Mattress now sets on a structured bed-frame with slats and a slice of plywood over the slats for extra structural support. Memory-foam topper back on top. I\'ve spent 3 nights on this mattress and am still getting used to it. I had a really old mattress/box spring that this replaced, and the old mattress with the 4"" Lucid topper really worked well for me - I slept really well, but felt it was time to get a new mattress. We\'ll see how well I sleep on it tonite w/out the box-spring underneath it, but right now, I get a softer feel with the mattress coils doing the work that my old box-spring might have been doing...If you want to ""sink-in"" like with memory foam, this mattress is NOT for you, b/c I already had a 4"" gel-infused memory foam topper, I\'m optimistic that this will work for me. I sleep comfortably, but because I work weird shifts, I cannot comment on whether you get a full, undisturbed sleep with this mattress. without my old box-spring, it feels incredibly comfortable right now. I gave it a 4 overall, with 3\'s in the specific categories while I get used to this new mattress, I was sleeping on a desperately old mattress and I\'ve only spent 3 nights on it, I\'ll return to give a more experienced review before I come up on my return date, I\'m inclined to keep this mattress b/c I already have the memory foam topper, but unless you really need the support, you might prefer the 12"" hybrid memory foam model of this mattress... just sayin\'...', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States April 30, 2020', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Holding up well, 3 years in!', 'author': 'James', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Super comfortable!

It still conforms to your body to a degree, but gives a little more support overall. To me it\'s incredibly comfortable, allowing me to fully and quickly relax my body. The proof is in the soundness of sleep I\'ve gotten and also how quickly I\'m able to get to sleep. I really didn\'t understand that a new, quality mattress would make this big of an impact, but I do now. I\'m only sorry I didn\'t make this purchase sooner, as I had researched and decided on this one a few months ago. I chose the 10"" one, the descriptions and video reviews I watched indicate that the 12"" model is a little softer and plusher. I think I chose the right one for me because I\'m happy with a medium amount of firmness and might have found the 12"" too soft.Unpacking and setup was simple and fast. The instructions recommend allowing 48 hours to expand before use, but mine seemed fully expanded after 24 hours so I slept on it after one day and it was fine. There was a slight to moderate odor of foam that fully dissipated after two or three days.I\'ve read and seen some reviews that suggest this mattress may be less durable than a more expensive one, perhaps lasting only 3-4 years (although it has a 10 year warranty). At this very affordable price for this level of comfort, I will be more than happy even if I only get a shorter amount of useful life (and I\'ll never make the mistake of going so long on a worn out mattress again).

Strap in. I\'ve got a lot to say about this mattress.My husband and I have been sleeping on this mattress for a few nights now. I will update this review in the coming months, but my initial reaction is that I am only disappointed in this mattress because it only recently came into my life. (Okay, there is one thing that actually does disappoint me about this mattress, but I\'ll get to it at the end of my review.)My sister-in-law has a Tuft&Needle Mint mattress, and I\'m not going to lie. It\'s freaking amazing. That is why I began looking into boxed mattresses in the first place. I actually had a T&N Mint in the cart and hovered over the button ready to buy it. But my instinct told me to look around first.I began looking at *all* the brands. ALL OF THE BRANDS. Again, I\'m an author...so research is my jam.Neither my husband nor myself are tiny people. I watched mattress review videos on YouTube from The Slumber Yard channel and realized we\'d probably be better off with a hybrid mattress rather than a strictly foam mattress.That little rabbit hole led me to Amazon where I discovered Lucid Mattresses.We bought the 12 inch Latex Hybrid. Both of us loathe memory foam, so that was out of the question.Other reviews say this mattress is not a medium on the firmness scale, but a firm-firm (some even say it\'s like sleeping on a brick). This was actually a selling point for me. While I disagree the bed is brick-like, it is definitely a lot firmer than a medium. For larger people this is an excellent thing. It\'s so supportive! And since all mattresses soften over time, its firmness out of the box, I would think, translates into longevity.The smell out of the box reminded me of a nail salon, but we let the mattress breathe for 24 hours before using it and we kept a fan on, oscillating over it the entire time and afterwards there was no smell at all.Edge support is FREAKING AWESOME. I can be right on the edge of the bed and never feel like I\'m going to fall off.One thing I haven\'t been able to find in a review for this mattress so far is, well, ""Will it be good for sex?"" Let\'s face it...memory foam mattresses are horrible for sex. There\'s no bounce. This mattress has bounce in spades. I was slightly worried about a foam mattress, or even a hybrid, for this very reason. Don\'t worry.Both my husband and myself are ""hot sleepers"" and neither of us are waking up in pools of sweat and discomfort. Actually, it\'s the opposite. We are sleeping much cooler now.I\'m 33 years old and wake up feeling 33 instead of 53. Within just a few days my back and shoulder pain is GONE. And my husband\'s back pain has been greatly reduced.Now, onto the only thing that disappoints me about this mattress:There are no handles on this mattress. I\'m pretty sure I understand why (because tugging on the handles would probably rip the mattresses\'s cover) but it\'s at least 134 pounds and there is an *excellent* non-slip element to the bottom of the cover...but that will sort of make it unduly difficult to rotate on the platform.That\'s it. That\'s my only gripe so far: a lack of handles.Listen, if you need further recommendation for this mattress: My dachshund used to get up in excess of 10-15 times per night because she would either get too hot or would just be downright uncomfortable...probably a combination of those reasons. She really won\'t say. ;-) But, since we\'ve been sleeping on this Lucid mattress...she hasn\'t gotten up A SINGLE TIME. Which just means my sleep is less disturbed than it once was *and* I\'m more comfortable to boot.I\'m really, really pleased with our Lucid.

Finally after 1+ year I\'m ready to share our story. On February 12th 2021, my husband and I purchased a LUCID 10 Inch Latex Hybrid Mattress - Memory Foam - Responsive Latex - Steel Coils - Medium Feel - Temperature Neutral on Amazon Prime. Please note our purchase selection was after careful and thorough research (including but not limited to sleepopolis.com).Our shipper received the item on February 19th 2021 and our family received it on Saturday March 20th 2021 (we reside outside the US). We unboxed it and removed compressed mattress (with tool provided) and put new mattress on our son\'s twin wooden bed frame and left it there for 48 hours for it to expand. There was a smell one can only describe as some sort of manufacturer\'s chemical but I was told this was the expected off gassing and we read this was normal and would dissipate (that never happened ☹️).After 48 hrs we made the bed with a 100% cotton fitted shit (the only kind we use) including covering sheet and blanket for our 14 year old son for whom the mattress was purchased. He slept on it for the first time on Monday night March 22nd 2021 at 10:00 p.m. He woke up on Tuesday and and of course our first inquiry was whether he slept well to which his response was yes.However, later on in the evening of Tuesday, March 23rd he asked that we checked his neck as he had some painful swelling there that was not there prior. We did, and observed what seemed like a lump and we presumed swollen lymph nodes. During his second night sleep on the new LUICID 10"" Latex Hybrid he complained of itchiness, which we found strange but indulged by changing his sheets. However after his second night\'s sleep he complained again, this time of severe neck discomfort and further checks revealed increase swelling in the cervical column (neck). It was obvious this time it was swollen lymph nodes this time coupled with mild skin rash over his arms and exposed areas where no clothing covers. Since his initial sleep on March 22nd 2021 we observed additional symptoms extreme fatigue, loss of appetite, headache, congestion without a cold or flu, irritated eyes in addition to those listed above (painful swollen lymph nodes, body rash particular areas not covered by clothing e.g. arms, nape). We then decide this was too serious and took him to his pediatrician who after multiple labs and physical examination could find no clinical diagnosis for his symptoms. He lost 5 pounds since his start of sleeping on new mattress and start of symptoms up until his first visit with his doctor. As a result of COVID and extreme protocols we were social distancing and sheltering in place and as per our pediatrician\'s inquiry, the only change in his life was his new bed. He had not gone anywhere and had not been exposed to anything else. So I wrote a very long and urgent email to LUCID inquiring whether the mattress we purchased from their company contains any fiber glass or any chemical or has been treated with any chemicals such as isocyanate or any other chemicals that would be making him sick. I did not intially receive a response.So I decided to check myself and observe what happens when he slept. To my dismay in his sleep he was scratching, so with my phone\'s flash light (in the darkened bedroom) I pulled up the end of the fitted sheet to check the sheet and the mattress. That simple test confirmed my worst fears and suspicions. There was a sparkly like substance on the sheet and the mattress itself was covered with it. So next I checked the label of the mattress (bottom where the grit side is) and confirmed that it does indeed contain fiberglass - 50% to be exact. I was floored. So I woke up my son and performed a tape test on him and was shocked by the tiny fibers that stuck on the tape.We were very thorough before we decided on this purchase, and this LUCID bed like most of not all of their products was one of those deemed Certi Pur. We have a right for full disclosure from the manufacturer LUCID to confirm whether their beds contains fiber glass or any chemicals that can make people (especially our children) sick. Nobody buys a bed especially for their child with the expectation that something like this happens. Afterall, nowhere in their product listing does it state or disclose the danger of fiberglass for the LUCID 10 Inch Latex Hybrid Mattress - Memory Foam - Responsive Latex - Steel Coils - Medium Feel - Temperature Neutral on Amazon Prime.When no one responded I decided to chat with Amazon and then the manufacturer and after explaining all of the above was told that while it was outside the US and they did not accept returns outside the US they would make an exception but I explained this was not possible to ship back from where I was. When I showed them the photos they then said they would make an exception and I refund me the full purchasing amount and I could throw it out which guess what I couldn\'t do fast enough. I was refunded but still absorbed the shipping, freight and duties charges but it was not about the money for us this entire ordeal made our child sick, cost us in ways I cannot even put a price tag on.https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0771P2BN9/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_glc_fabc_YYS65XDRJ8Z8EXGYN7WT?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States June 17, 2022', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Updated review: no fiberglass, SUPER boingy, buy from Amazon not direct from Lucid', 'author': 'Amazon Customer', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'Quick overview: no fiberglass, super comfortable (if you like boingy mattresses), fixable expansion issues -- overall a good product from a sucky company. Buy from Amazon so you never have to deal with Lucid, if you can ever reach them.------------------Initial review: I just unboxed this mattress, and I am going to post the information I wish others had: the materials list. Lucid was one of the brands that used a fiberglass inner sock for fire retardance a few years back. I am happy to report there is NO fiberglass now. I am also pretty pleased it was made in Taiwan. No word yet on how the mattress functions. It arrived in sub-zero temps, so I imagine it will take a bit to expand.------------------Update day 2: The mattress has mostly expanded, but I am hoping the edges and the most smooshed end fill out the whole way by tomorrow night. Even now, it is insanely comfortable. This is coming from someone who detests memory foam mattresses. We have a split king, so I am not worried about motion transfer. I have been getting by with a 2"" talalay latex mattress topper on a foam Nectar mattress that (on its own) left me with stiff shoulders and numb arms.The Lucid Latex Hybrid is super springy, with the added latex boing-effect I was looking for. It was only about twice the price of my latex topper, and I don\'t have to deal with slippage. This is NOT a mattress you will sink into, but instead I seem to float on top. I am a back-and-side sleeper who likes a firmer mattress (but not firm foam, that was a disaster).------------------One month update: I really love this mattress. It is SO comfortable. But Lucid as a company sucks pretty bad. I was trying to get confirmation about the fiberglass issue, as some redditor mentioned it might not be on the materials list. There is a phone number, but no one picks up, and you can\'t leave a message. Lucid doesn\'t answer FB direct messages, despite saying they will, and the company will take for-freaking-ever to return your email. What I finally got back was:""Thank you for reaching out to us. All of our mattresses have been tested and do meet or exceed the federal, state, and municipal safety standards. All materials will be listed on the white law tags under the mattress.Sincerely,WyattLucid Mattress Customer Experience""So, in short, if your tag doesn\'t include fiberglass neither does your Lucid mattress. But their mealy-mouthed reply implies they still use fiberglass in some of their mattresses so shop carefully. Also, I would buy from Amazon just so I never have to deal directly with Lucid.On to mattress expansion. Mine arrived in -15F degree weather and it sat outside my house for several hours, so I knew it would take a bit. I finally took the mattress cover off (which you aren\'t supposed to remove) and took a hair dryer to the foam. That did the expansion trick, although it was time-consuming. If I was doing it again I would use a heat gun on low and be extra careful not to overheat anything. The mattress is now the full 12\' and evenly expanded. One of the complaints I see is the edges not expanding correctly so the mattress puffs up in the middle. That is how mine looked pre-hairdryer.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 23, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Excelente.', 'author': 'Héctor', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Una excelente adquisición.

My wife and I have been needing a new mattress for quite some time, yet the cost was always a pain point. Little did I know that there were less expensive options available so I decided to try one of them as a Christmas gift to us. I decided to sleep on the mattress for a week or two before I wrote my review to make sure that we were satisfied with it. First let me say that my wife LOVES this mattress and has loved it sine the first night we slept on it! Not only was it nearly fully inflated after only about 8-9 hours, but it continued to fill over the next 24 hours even after used that first night.Another thing we noticed is that in my research a lot of people complained that other mattresses did not fill on the edges making it unable to be sat on without slipping off. Not with this mattress! Even the corners were filled and firm and we both are able to sit on the edge. We both are 200- 300 pounds respectfully and we have had the best sleep than we have had in years! My wife said after the first night that she slept like a baby and had minimal to no pain in her body, even her knee which she has had surgery on five times was not as painful. I also have not experienced much pain and have minimal difficulty walking after waking up.After researching at least 10 different mattresses on Amazon, I am so glad that I chose this one, you will NOYT go wrong in getting this one. The price- EXCELLENT, the product- IMPECCABLE, the comfort- UNMATCHED! It has a soft yet firm feel that works and best of all... NO SMELL when it came out of the wrapping which I'd read from others was an issue. I am glad I chose this one, if you are on the fence with it- GET IT!

I did let it sit open for about 15 hours before sleeping on it. 24 hours seemed to be the consensus of online sources, but being a hybrid with springs, I believe expansion is quicker, as there is not as much foam to deal with. If this mattress maintains this level of comfort, I will consider it a great purchase and a fantastic deal at 189$ I paid! I will alter review if things change.

The last 2 years have been progressively worse for waking up from hip and back pain 2-3 times a night. I loved my mattress but it was time to make a change. I need a firm mattress but not hard. There weren\'t many reviews for this one but the ones there were seemed to agree this mattress, queen 12"" med firm, might be the one I was looking for. I kept thinking I probably should buy local where I could actually feel the firmness, but I talked myself into hitting the order button after removing this from my cart 3 times and always putting it back. The mattress arrived via FedEx Ex 2 days earlier than expected. By 5 PM I got the box up the stairs and wrestled it onto my temperpedic so it could expand. I cut the box and unwrapped the shrinkwrap which contained the mattress in a bag. As soon as the bag sucked air, the magic started. I worked fast to unbag and roll it out. By the time I got the wrappings picked up the mattress had already grown to 8"". Maybe I wasn\'t going to have to sleep in the recliner after all!By 10PM it was fully 12"", even the corners! I put on my sheets and decided I wasn\'t going to wait 24-48 hours cause how could it get any bigger?It\'s hard to explain just how it felt, not hard firm as others and not sloppy soft.It was just...comfortable! There is enough \'soft\' to cradle me but not sink in. I had NO difficulty moving from my back to my side nor was there the familiar pressure on my shoulder that I had become accustomed to when on my side. I laid there wondering if I had found what I was hoping for and simply fell asleep. It was 90+ degrees the day it arrived and even with AC on, that night was a sultry 80 degrees in my room. I did not get hot, which was something I was experiencing with the Temperpedic, waking up soggy and trying to find a spot that wasn\'t damp. Whatever this Swiss mattress has as a \'cooling\' layer works!!When I woke in the morning the first thing I realized was that I had actually slept through the night and was basically in the same position that I had fallen asleep in. I moved my legs and was waiting for the all too common spasm to let me know I was really awake but....nothing!! I slid off the mattress and gingerly stood up. No twinge. I took a step and then another, still nothing!I found I was walking completely upright, not hunched over till I worked the kinks out of my back. To say I was amazed is an understatement. I just wanted to get back into bed, but i had to go to work. I wondered if it was a fluke or my imagination or mind over matter telling myself it HAD to be my old mattress making my nights and mornings a nightmare.

We are happy and will be keeping it - and I honestly have no idea how you would go about returning it anyway. This thing is heavy and huge once it has been opened and expanded.Because this is our first memory foam mattress, it took a couple of weeks to get used to. I didn\'t sleep well the first night. It doesn\'t bounce or sink quite as readily and a traditional spring-type mattress. If you like to jump into bed, you will be surprised at how ""solid"" it initially feels. However, if I just lay down on it, it conforms very nicely to my body. There are no ""pressure"" points. Also, the ""cooling"" gel really does work - which is nice on warm nights and not so nice on cold nights.When I lay on my back or stomach, this mattress is absolutely heavenly. When I lay on my side (which is how I typically sleep) it is also nice, but I wish it had a little more give where my shoulder goes. However, I remember thinking the same thing about our plush pillowtop mattress. Overall, I am now sleeping better and wake up with fewer aches and pains than ever before.

I am very careful opening them as it is a pain to send back anything let alone something that is vacuum sealed. We laid the mattress on the tile floor and waited for a week and yet it has not expanded anymore and the same side is still crushed. When I requested a refund it said I needed to return this item and pay the return postage. I have sent a message to the seller requesting information on HOW to return this item. There is no way that this item can be used, you can see a line in the middle of the mattress, which may be caused by the packaging. After going through the other reviews in the hopes of finding out if anyone else has had this issue, it seems to be a common occurrence. There has to be a better way of returning these types of items when there are defects in the product or packaging. This should not be at the cost of the consumer when they aren't even able to use the product. However, this is the chance you take when ordering any item online.Update: After messaging the seller, explaining the situation, exchanging photos they were quick to respond and offer a refund/replacement.

I've heard about these box mattresses before but had been skeptical and this is my first time trying one. I have to say that I am impressed and find it mind blowing that a mattress can be compressed and shipped this way. This is not an air mattress, it is a gel memory foam mattress. Any mattrss does contain a lof of air in the materials though which allows them to be comfortable. Without any internal springs, this mattress can be compressed and rolled up.This mattress is real. heavy so keep that in mind when moving it. This is a queen size mattress after all. If you have room to unroll it, this would help for getting the outer layer of plastic off of it. I put the rolled up mattress on teh bed frame and managed to maneuver it to get the outer plastic off. Once that is removed you can unroll it and stretch it out on your frame as you see in my picture. You then cut into the final layer of plastic with a provided tool and remove it. Once you pierce that plastic, the magic begins. Air is rapidly sucked in and the mattress expands. Within a few seconds it expands into a nice pillow top gel memory foam mattress. See the video.As far as comfort, I found it to be a little soft but this is gel memory foam and molds to your body. So while I sink in a little more, I still felt well supported. I don't find myself moving around on it and can fall asleep pretty quickly. I imagine we'll be seeing the majority of mattresses shipped this way soon.

We replaced our old brand-name 12” plush mattress and have been very pleased with the comfort we get from this Lechepus mattress.This was our first experience with a “Mattress in a Box”. I was concerned with how heavy the mattress was (120 pounds). Moving the box was not easy, but we used a hand cart and plopped the box on the floor near the bed. We opened one side and slid the mattress out. It was not too difficult to prop the plastic-wrapped mattress onto our box spring base. We then carefully cut the plastic using the enclosed safety cutter until the mattress was free.When you first pierce to the inside you hear the “ssss” air beginning to reach the mattress. Once the plastic is removed the bed automatically decompresses very quickly.Once the bed is open to its full shape, the bed was easy to move on the box springs and the bed was easy to move.What I realized when I had to move our old standard king mattress is that it is also very heavy – approximately 110 pounds. So the weight of these “Box” mattresses is really not that different than a standard mattress, which is why once the mattress was fully opened and decompressed, it felt no different than a standard mattress as far as moving etc.We’ve enjoyed sleeping on this mattress for several nights.

You cannot tell from the cropped photos how excited she was to see this new mattress expand from the tightly rolled form it was shipped in to become a complete and at least partially expanded mattress. We gave that a couple of days for complete relaxation although it could have been used the next day I\'m sure. She reported that it had good support and good comfort for her sleep that next night, and the four nights since those photos were taken. There was very limited odor from the foam as we unwrapped the mattress and it expanded out pretty quickly. We couldn\'t discern that any existing odor was present at all once it was ready to be slept on. I think there was more odor coming from the new foam pad and the new carpet than there was from this mattress. The mattress topping is soft to the touch and gently cushioning. Stitching seems to be very consistent on all sections of the mattress. Once it had fully expanded it was ready for use. So her words, ""Thank You"".She now gets to enjoy a super comfortable nights sleep on a new mattress, complete with a new mattress pad, and new sheets, and new pillow.

The build quality and luxurious materials used are high grade. Overall, the Sapira is a class act.Day 1: The mattress arrives in a tall square-box, about 2x2x4. I attached a photo of what the mattress looks like compressed inside the box. Upon placing the mattress on my boxspring, I cut the plastic off and the bed immediately sprung to life, literally, as the coils decompressed. Yes, there is a noticeable off-gassing smell, but it\'s not offensive. I left my window open at night, and 90% of the smell was gone by the next morning.Day 2: At first, the mattress was a bit firm, but after about 24-36 hours the mattress had fully decompressed and was much more comfortable. It\'s probably a 6.5/7 out of 10 on the firmness scale, the way most online professional mattress websites suggest. The top Avena foam layer sleeps cool, so I don\'t overheat. The bounce the Avena foam + the pocketed coils provide makes moving around, and getting out of bed effortless. The off-gassing smell is just about gone now.Day 3: Decided to get rid of my old mattress and keep the Sapira. I sleep mostly on my back, but sometimes on my side and stomach throughout the night. The only sleep position I thought wasn\'t going to work out was the side position, because of the firmness, but the 3 inches of Avena + memory foam actually provide just enough sinkage, while keeping my spine aligned. The off-gassing smell is completely gone now. I bought a mattress protector, and then my bed sheet goes over that to complete the package.When I bought this mattress last Sunday, there were 20 left in stock with Amazon. As of this morning, only 9 Queen-size beds were left in stock, while some sizes other than Queen were already out of stock. So clearly word is getting out about this mattress. At $1,325, it\'s also a lot less expensive than every other hybrid mattress on the market, most of which will cost at least $2,000 more than this one, and will require you going to a showroom, and taking time off work to be home for delivery.In conclusion, I highly recommend this mattress. Please feel free to ask me any direct questions on here. Also, if you have time, I recommend reading the review on Sleepopolis, as it\'s the most comprehensive professional review that matches my own experience.Update: although I bought a Claritin mattress protector, and although when I called Sapira customer service they recommended having one too, I removed it on Day 4. It added a ""plastic"" feel to the surface of the bed that became unbearable. Once I removed it, that initial softness I experienced on Day 1 came back again. I only intend to use just my bedsheet from here on out. I recommend you do the same.((On a side note, I suggest ignoring the only other two reviews on here, both two stars. Unlike myself, neither one is a confirmed buyer of this product. The first review is too short to be real for a legitimate mattress evaluation by an actual customer. The fact that this mattress has the firmness rating it does shows the Sapira is designed for superior back support, so the reviewer\'s complaint is illogical. The second review is also partially off topic, as they discuss the manufacturers\'s website, which has nothing to do with how the mattress feels. Yes, they are correct the mattress is a little firm, but every other online review already confirms this. So to slam the product with only two stars for performing how it was designed is unfair.))', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 2, 2017', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars good quality and definitely med firm', 'author': 'KC', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I've slept on this mattress now for a week and am very pleased with its level of firmness.

Yes, the memory foam ""bounced"" back to normal once I got up, but that didn\'t help while I was lying down!

Idk why people are saying it’s not exactly 10inches bc mine is. Watching it inflate from a thicker pancake was definitely cool. I noticed a couple of people cut there mattress taking it out of plastic so we just made a U shape cut in one corner and then opposite corner and sides began to inflate but it released the tight no inch seal around the mattress first. Then we cut just one side and the top and bottom being sure to leave the plastic wrap on the opposite edge and top and bottom trying to keep it somewhat covered while it came to its original size due to it being stark white and in the kitchen and didn’t want to get it dirty.Like I said we waited about 48 hours to move it to the bed. As an after thought, still trying to keep it perfect, we set out to get some type of perfection for it incase we were to ever spill on it or sweat super bad (ya never know 🤷\u200d♀️). Looked at Walmart and I just felt as if they were super thin looking, cheap, and nothing special (most were the kind that would crinkle when you moved if you didn’t want to pay upwards of $50+. So then I went on target app and when I saw it I knew that was the one. Some of the reviews commented that edges of mattress weren’t supportive and if your on one you kind of roll off or fall off. The pad I found was quilted and almost feather bed ish if you know what I mean. But this one specifically had a 3inch outer quilting layer that would provide support around edges if what other reviewer said was true.So we put the mattress pad on (oh and it was only $37!!!) made the bed and the rest is history. 1-2 people said it’s quality you get in a nice hotel and I definitely agree with that if not this is nicer. When my partner moves or gets up I don’t even feel him honestly. When you lay in it you sink slightly (just enough for there to be a very mild cushioning around you but not enough to make the mattress not good for your back or good nights sleep. For past 2 nights I haven’t gotten up in middle of night for anything (bathroom, cigarette, food…nothing!)…that’s unheard of for me. My back hasn’t hurt whatsoever (idk if it’s springs, the 7 layers, special padding, idk but I’m in love). I even laid down after breakfast today and fell asleep for a good hour and a half bc it’s so comfortable. My fiancé somewhat rushes home to lay in it after long day and teases me with selfies laying on bed while I’m still at work.I’m by far beyond pleased with this purchase. I can’t say enough good things about it. If you want an affordable or even expensive mattress (bc you feel the more you spend the better the quality) that is made amazing and will give you best sleep you’ve ever had….this one is for you… hands down 👍🏼', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 10, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Comfortable!', 'author': 'Huda s.', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'Great price And very comfy.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 12, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great Mattress', 'author': 'ana lopez', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I purchased this mattress back in 2021.

It looks great. No fiberglass coming out like in other bed reviews . It feels perfect around the edges at each end with a soft but firm feeling. But the middle of the bed isn’t firm enough and sinks in quite a bit when you sit on it and lay on it. I really wish the rest of the bed felt like the edges of each end of the bed. And when you’re standing in front of the bed and you look straight at it you can see that from the left and to the right side (which is worse) of the middle of the bed never fully straightened out and filled completely out after opening and airing the bed up for a couple of days. It looks like a bed that’s been slept on for several years. I thought this mattress was supposed to be firmer. I’ve also been waking up with headaches and both of my arms and hands having fallen asleep. I don’t think I’m getting proper blood circulation in this bed. But other than these uncomfortable issues it’s not horrible. It’s ok to lay on and watch TV, you just sink quite a bit in it like memory foam mattresses even though there are coil springs in it. My previous mattress, I had it for so long that the springs recently started coming out so at least I’m not feeling that anymore. But I really wish I hadn’t bought this mattress. I will never buy a mattress in a box ever again. I will go into a store and try each one out in person and buy a mattress like I did with my previous one.

Like most reviews about this mattress here, including mine, they are from someone who hasn\'t had this mattress very long, so I will be updating this from time to time. It\'s easy to say it is nice and comfortable when it\'s new, but how does it hold up over time is important to know so updates will be coming to this review from time to time.Pros:Shipping was right on time and it was packaged carefully and received in great condition. We received it on Thursday and put it on the bed and unwrapped it as soon as we got it. There was no odor or chemical smell of any kind right out of the box. We let it expand for more than 48 hours before sleeping on it Saturday, or last night. The mattress is very firm with a plush topper on it. It\'s very firm but not hard. I had the best nights sleep last night that I\'ve had in a very long time last night thanks to this mattress. It is very supportive and comfortable. I am a side sleeper that turns frequently and I found myself turning last night much less than I usually do. We are coming off a twelve year old 10 inch Serta mattress and I am pleased as punch that we went with the 14 inch mattress this time. I\'m really impressed with how tall it is. As a big and tall person, the height makes is real easy to get in and out of.Cons:None yetOther information:I am a big person, 6\'3"" and 330#. My wife is pretty small, about 5\'3"" and 135#. After the first night her opinion is that she was comfortable on it and slept better than she has in a while. It may actually prove to be a bit firm for a smaller person or for someone who doesn\'t care for a firm mattress, , but for me, I am very surprised and happy with how well it supports me. Again, it is very firm but not hard - very supportive. The topper adds just the right amount of plush softness on top where we lie. When either of us move or roll on our side, the other person doesn\'t feel it on their side.Recommendation:If you are a big or tall or heavy person and need a firm mattress, or just someone whole prefers a firm mattress, I recommend this one in the 14 inch height. The 14 inch height is well worth the additional cost over the 10 inch in my opinion. I also recommend for the 14 inch mattress that you let it expand 48 hours before sleeping on it. The website recommends 24 hours, but I can tell you that after the initial 24 hour period, ours expanded another several inches over the second 24 hour period. Give it 48 hours to expand before sleeping on it, you will be glad you did.11-26-2019 UPDATEHave slept on the mattress 10 nights now.

It has been moved home and then back up to another apartment. We were able to fold it in half and hold it with ratchet tie straps in order to transport it in a SUV. It does take at least 2 people and ratchet ties to get it folded top to bottom ends. Surprisingly, folding didn’t negatively affect the mattress. It easily went back to its normal shape.So I bought this mattress for my son\'s bed at his college apartment. I wasn\'t sure what to expect, but I have been pleasantly surprised. He says that it is very comfortable and he sleeps well on it. The mattress pairs nicely with the ZINUS Judy Upholstered Platform Bed Frame / Mattress Foundation / Wood Slat Support / No Box Spring Needed / Easy Assembly, Full (and no box spring needed). I do recommend going with 14"" mattress because I think the thicker the mattress, the more comfortable it is. My only complaint/issue with this mattress is that if you sit on the edge, you are going to slide off because there isn\'t much support along the edges (as you would see with a $1000 coil mattress). But for only costing $250 and arriving condensed in a box that allowed it to be easily put in an SUV and transported up to school, I can\'t complain. We were originally looking at mattresses at C*stc*, but this was about half the price and fit inside the SUV.

It’s very comfortable and my husband and I have almost no back pain upon waking up anymore. I will say I can feel movement more so with this bed when my husband turns over but it’s not a lot. It was super simple to open. Just pull the plastic off and let it rise. We opened it and it inflated almost fully immediately. I let it continue to inflate for almost two days and if you measure from the poofiness of the bottom and the top it’s about 13 inches but I ordered the 14 inch. That’s not a big deal for us. Everything feels just fine. You can see in the pictures that all the corners didn’t fully untuck but again it’s not a big deal for me. You really can’t beat this bed for around $500.

Also, being a stomach / side sleeper, my low back tends to hurt/be stiff when I wake. This was something I was hoping to alleviate with a new mattress but it just isn’t firm enough. Obviously I’m keeping it though because returns are impossible. I don’t have a machine to vacuum pack a 35lb mattress in plastic to mail back - as the condition it arrived. Also, yes it is kind of heavy being around 35lbs. I know that isn’t a lot in general but it is for a full size mattress. Anyway, I’m looking to invest in a firm mattress topper.

I do recommend!', 'author': 'Tessa S.', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I have never slept on, or even tested any type of memory foam anything before! So I may be a bit biased, but I am totally satisfied with this purchase. The mattress was shipped to us a whole 4 days early (UPS Air), so thank you Amazon, PrimaSleep, and UPS for making this happen! So, I'm going to list all of the things I love about this mattress:1. It is very soft/cushiony yet wonderfully firm/supportive! It's not too firm or too soft. As another reviewer previously mentioned, it is difficult to explain the balance, you'd only understand fully if you felt it for yourself. It really does relieve pressure in your body. It conforms to your body impressively - this prevents limbs from falling asleep, and keeps you from waking up feeling sore/stiff. My husband and I both have back problems, and this has helped us so much already!2. The mattress shipped quickly, was fairly easy to unpack (though the box was very heavy and UPS had to help us carry it to our door, we had to use a dolly the rest of the way).3. It is recommended that you wait 48-72 hours before sleeping on your mattress to allow it to rise/ventilate. In most cases this is true. In ours, not so much. Our mattress rose to 7 inches within just an hour! It then rose to 8 inches in only 2 hours! The corners took a little longer to rise, but that doesn't affect our sleep at all! I have read that in humid climates memory foam can rise more quickly. Well we live in a sub-tropical climate, and ours decompressed rapidly! It reached 6 inches more minutes after removing it from the box.4. When we first pulled it out of the box, I was expecting to be hit in the face by the smell everyone always talks about (which I know is from off-gassing). I smelled nothing. I put my face into the mattress and sniffed aggressively, I smelled nothing and neither did my husband. After we dressed the bed and climbed in it, I smelled the faintest hint of something, but it quickly dissipated. So if you're worried about smell, I didn't have a problem with that and it shouldn't be a huge problem for anyone who orders this mattress.5. The price. This price is so amazingly low/affordable, I am so grateful to be able to sleep in such a comfortable bed, a memory foam bed, for the first time in my life. Growing up I slept on a twin bed with two box springs (from 4 years old to 18), and in the last few years I have only slept on old springy mattresses. They really made this affordable and I'm so happy because everyone deserves to sleep comfortably and to rest well! If I ever get rich I will buy this product for anyone who needs one!Bottom line: this mattress IS exceptionally comfortable! In the couple of nights I have slept on it, I have not noticed any sinking (the mattress is on top of a box spring), no weird or unpleasant smells, or anything I don't like about it. You get amazing quality for a low price. Anyone who has slept in uncomfortable beds frequently will appreciate this mattress. If you are used to really expensive memory foam mattresses, you might not be happy with this one. Then again, I'd be willing to wager that this PrimaSleep mattress is comparable in quality to the more expensive brands. I definitely recommend this mattress to anyone who needs a comfortable mattress, but doesn't want it to cost them an arm and a leg! When I am enjoying the comfort and stability of this mattress, I also exhale deeply and feel great about how much money I saved by purchasing a PrimaSleep mattress!If you aren't used to sleeping on a bed like this, give yourself time to adjust, it can take a while! Also, take the mattress out of the box as soon as you get it (or ASAP) because the longer it stays inside the box, the higher risk it may not decompress properly! The mattress will have an easier time rising if it is placed on a flat surface. As always, do plenty of research before making a significant purchase such a this! If you happen to read my review, I stand by the quality of this product, this is the mattress I will be sleeping on for years, and I will continue to buy from PrimaSleep in the future.

I compared every major brand (T&N, Casper, Nectar, Purple, etc) to this one and just couldn't stomach the cost of any of the other brands. I purchased this mattress because of the positive reviews, the boxed delivery for easy moving (I ordered this shortly before moving out-of-state for grad school), and the return policy. I'm so thrilled that I won't have to use that policy! This mattress is exactly what I was looking for in terms of firmness/softness - it's hard to describe that balance without feeling the mattress, but it's firm enough to be supportive without being hard as a rock. It is so comfortable. I had to keep it in the box for almost a month, which is not recommended, but even still it began rising as soon as I cut off the plastic wrap. Zero chemical or other smell, zero delay, and was ready to sleep on within a day. I would never purchase a $700+ mattress from a more well-known brand when this one checked every box for a fraction of the cost. Absolutely order this, if you're on the fence.UPDATE: In a sudden, last-minute COVID-related move, I had to pack everything I own into just my RAV4. After three hours of trying to fit the mattress (vacuum-sealed) into the car with everything else, I had to leave it behind. Not the fault of the mattress - would have been fine if I had an actual moving van or even just another car to help me move. I ordered a different mattress as this one was unavailable when I needed to order, and after two nights on the other mattress, I had horrible hip pain. Horrible. I'm 23 and have never had joint pain like this (or at all) and chose to sleep on the floor for a week instead of sleeping on it anymore. I reordered this mattress as soon as it became available, and it arrived a week before it said it would. Set it up around 10am and it was good to go by about 3pm. SO COMFY. Hip pain is gone, I sleep like a rock every night, and I have no complaints whatsoever. I now know that I'll be dragging this mattress with me to every home I have until it is too old, and as soon as I have any storage space to speak of, I'll buy another one to keep in box so that I have a replacement when that day comes.

It came delivered in a lightweight rectangular box (the top of the box was opened for some reason, but the contents were great). I thought it would take 24 hours to inflate to a decent height but after heading out for about an hour it was ready to sleep on. I didn’t measure the actual inflated height to see if it matched the description, but whatever it was it was good enough.Initially climbing onto the bed, knees first, I could feel the bar rungs of the metal frame beneath the mattress, but once I’m sitting on the bed or lying on the bed my weight distributes and I’m totally comfortable. After spending a month or so sleeping on an air mattress this was such a huge and comfortable change for me as a pregnant woman. No more waking with a damp sweat because the plastic mattress is non-breathable, even with a sheet over the top. This reduced the pain for the pressure/weight on my side during side-sleeping and I feel so cozy and comfortable every time I lie down.If I were to make any improvements it would probably be to add thin board under my mattress so that I don’t feel the metal rungs when I climb in and out of bed, but it’s such an insignificant problem that I probably won’t ever end up doing that despite my “good intentions.”My husband’s only complaint about this bed as opposed to the air bed is that he’s a bit warm at night. My husband runs hot and this is definitely a bit sink-into-it cushiony. This could ultimately be more a result of the bed-bug, liquid-proof encasement over the mattress, so without it it may have more breathability and be less warm, but I am personally enjoying the mattress.I got it for just under $139, including free shipping through Amazon prime. I was searching for a while on IKEA (where I previously purchased an EXCELLENT spring mattress for under $150, but now out of stock), and I also searched Wayfair and Macy’s mattress deal but this was ultimately the best deal I found on cheap mattresses that included shipping and delivered a product that I was happy with.If you’re on a budget and looking for a cheap mattress then this is the way to go. This is my first non-spring maytress and I love it. There are suggestions for purchasing a topper to soften if, but I’ll be sleeping with a baby in the bed and this is probably the softest I’d feel comfortable co-sleeping a baby in. In fact I’m probably only going to have baby in the bed co-sleeper until the baby is several months old because the softness of this mattress could be risky to have a baby sleeping straight on.Great buy - if you’re debating between several - get this one!', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 19, 2019', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '3.0 out of 5 stars Sleeps good, but definitely is not six inches.', 'author': 'M0mmy0f2Girls', 'rating': 3, 'content': 'It’s soft, it sleeps good, however it will not ever expand to six inches.

So, as people kept reviewing that this was both ""too soft"" AND ""too hard"" (I think more said too soft) considering my last purchase I wanted something a little bit softer.This is neither! For me it\'s perfect, really. It\'s firm yet a little bit soft, not too hard that it hurts my hips like the last one. I\'m 5\'6 and an average size for that height if that helps. Maybe heavier people might have more of an issue with these types of boxed mattresses as they say it\'s too soft and I don\'t know how much it might ""give way"". The manufacturers should really put height/weight ranges on their products, seems pretty obvious. But, I guess they\'d rather just sell more than sell to the right person.This mattress is shorter, though! It\'s exactly 6 feet from top to bottom and since no one sleeps with their head on the top edge of a bed, you are losing several of those inches. I\'m often finding my feet hanging off the edge so at 5\'6 myself, I would not suggest this ""full"" size for anyone that\'s taller. You\'ll probably want a Queen or King. I looked up the typical size for a full and I\'m seeing 75-inches versus this mattress being 72-inches. I am noticing those 3-inches missing. I don\'t really mind if during my tossing around my feet end up going off the mattress a bit, though. I don\'t think it messes with my sleep.It was easy to unroll!

So far so good.The mattress is mostly springs. The top section of the mattress that is between two hems that is greyblue is not just foam but is still mostly 98% spring. I can't say that there is much foam at all there. So, the product photos on Amazon made it look like there were was much more foam.What I'm looking for is support like a half filled air mattress with a memory foam top without the flat/limp feel when moving on it or sitting on it. In essence I want the mattress to fill in the parts with support of the body where there is less mass and higher points and cushion the heavier mass and lower points of the body. So that's why I chose a hybrid mattress with individual springs.I hope to update this as I sleep on it more. However with it mostly just being springs and less foam than I thought I may have to put at least a 2-in foam topper on it.-- After 3 nights on it I had to definitely put a foam topper on it. It's a very firm mattress. I am on a solid platform. In a way I like it but it's not what I was looking for initially.-----Okay so it's been a bit more time. I really like this mattress yet it might not be the best for me being a restless sleeper. I might need foam only.For me the spring/hybrid mattress is fun to lay on with more of a free feeling to it compared to just foam because the only foam mattresses seem to hold me more in place. However, for me that memory foam hold in place is good because I am less resless.However, the difference I feel is more push on my lower back and butt on this hybrid maybe because I'm not sinking in the same way on just foam and It took a week to get used to that. I switched back to a new foam for a night and slept really good and woke up without any issues right away. This mattress took me longer to get used to than foam.Another thing though between only foam and this hybrid is you can always add a memory foam pad to the spring/hybrid later where adding more foam pad to an only foam mattresses may be a bit too much foam. I tried it.What I do like about this mattress is the cotton covering around it and it does not smell like foam only mattresses.----After a bit more time, I've bounced between a foam mattress and this one and I'm reconsidering and have decided that I like this one much more because of its back support feel.

That's when I discovered the DIGLANT King Mattress, and let me tell you, it was love at first sleep.Why I'm Head Over Heels for My DIGLANT Mattress:The Perfect Balance of Firmness: I've danced on both sides of the mattress firmness spectrum, and finding the middle ground has always been a challenge. The DIGLANT mattress, with its medium plush feel, is like the Goldilocks of beds—not too firm, not too soft, just right. It cradles my body with just enough give to feel luxurious yet offers the support my back needs to wake up feeling refreshed and pain-free.Support Where It Counts: The difference maker for me has been the 7-zone individual pocket springs. This isn't your average spring system; it's tailored to provide targeted support across different areas of your body. The result? A more personalized sleep experience that adapts to my needs, whether I'm curled up in a fetal position or lying flat on my back, staring at the ceiling and pondering life's mysteries.Staying Cool Under the Covers: I used to be that person who'd flip the pillow in search of the cool side throughout the night.

Its ability to regulate temperature and keep heat at bay has been a game-changer, especially during those warm summer nights when even a whisper of warmth can be the difference between sweet dreams and a night of tossing and turning.Seamless Transition from Box to Bed: The unboxing experience was surprisingly satisfying. Watching the mattress expand and take shape was like witnessing a caterpillar transform into a butterfly—effortless and beautiful. It reached its full size without any weird dips or bumps, a testament to the quality and care put into its design and packaging.Edge Support That Defies Gravity: As someone who often finds themselves perched on the edge of the bed, either reading a book or simply contemplating the day ahead, the edge support on this mattress is a revelation. Gone are the days of slowly sliding off the bed or feeling unsupported. The DIGLANT mattress holds firm, providing a stable and comfortable perch no matter where I find myself.The Verdict:Reflecting on my sleep journey, the transition to the DIGLANT King Mattress feels like moving from a cramped apartment into a spacious, luxurious home. Every night, I look forward to the embrace of my mattress, knowing it will provide the perfect blend of comfort, support, and coolness. The thoughtful design, from the targeted spring support to the temperature regulation and robust edge support, shows a deep understanding of what makes a good night's sleep truly great."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 7, 2024', 'is_verified': False}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Meets or exceeds expectations', 'author': 'Jeff & Wendy S', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Shopping for a mattress online is about the hardest thing you can shop for. I\'m a car-but who has spent less time researching a car than a mail-order mattress. Pick any mattress and the reviews will be all over the place... and you can\'t really return them if you don\'t like them (I\'m not sure what they do.)Disclaimer: possibly as someone who has spent more hours than I can count researching mattresses on Amazon I was offered this one at a substantial discount through the Vine reviewer\'s program... but while I *do* factor in cost/value in my reviews, I do NOT let the discount influence my reviews... but it does get me to try products I might not have otherwise tried.That said, I took a chance on a brand I\'d never heard of before and ordered this. It arrived via freight truck surprisingly quickly. My first impression was that I was shocked how heavy it was (130 pounds!). It\'s also very tall! So make sure your bed situation can handle a 14"" tall mattrees. This is neither a good or bad thing, but something you should be aware of. It took two of us to lift it onto the platform.It expanded very quickly, but I resisted the urge to evaluate it too quickly. I didn\'t even get on it for 24 hours, and didn\'t sleep on it until the third night. (Although I don\'t think you would do any harm by using it immediately. The instructions do say it could take 7 days (!) to fully expand. The truth is, it\'s going to expand 90% in the first few minutes, 95% in the first few hours, and then take a couple of days to finish taking the tiny bit of bagginess out of the sides.) One thing to note: before you remove even the outer plastic sleeve, make sure you\'ve placed the mattress where you want it. I very carefully cut away the two outer sleeves and found there was a very small hole (nowhere near where I was cutting - it wasn\'t me) in the vacuum wrap so it slowly started expanding immediately... then, once I intentionally cut the vacuum wrap, it expanded much more quickly.)But you don\'t care about all that... you want to know how it works.Very well! So far, I love it!We just moved across the country, leaving behind 3 mattresses that all worked well. We temporarily moved into a furnished rental that has a well-known second-tier brand (starts with a ""Z"") and a VERY expensive brand name Te---Pe---. THIS is my favorite of the 6 mattresses I\'ve used in the last 2 months (The ""Z"" brand is a close second - also very good). I\'ve not tested in temperature extremes, but it seems very neutral. Also, some people ask about ""chemical"" smell... this has pretty much none. There was a little when I first opened it up, but it was a light, pleasant odor, like new furniture, and nothing you\'d walk into the room and notice.The Amazon page says this is a ""plush"", but I think it was the label on the box that said it was a ""medium plush"". I think ""medium plush"" is the more accurate. I love soft beds, but I\'m always afraid that if it\'s *too* soft it could hurt my bad back or could feel constricting. Had I tried this mattress blindly, I would have guessed it was a medium, so my fear of it being ""too"" soft is not a concern. I think this is a bed that could satisfy anyone who didn\'t need the most extreme ends of the scale. Heck, I might even put a thin (1 - 1.5"") memory foam topper on it for added luxury, but it\'s pretty nice as-is, soft and conforming, yet supportive. I\'m not sure if it\'s my ""dream"" mattress, (I haven\'t found that yet) but it\'s excellent and also better (to me) than the multi-thousand mattresses I tried in the furniture store recently... the purple one was pretty nice, but I don\'t think I\'d ever pay that much.Well done.

I admit that I was skeptical because I wondered how does it keep integrity and comfort when it is rolled up before use. Well, I am a firm believer (no pun intended). Once you open the box and unravel the mattress, I gave it 48 hours for it to fully expand before using it. It measures at 14"" and laying down on it, I was amazed at how comfortable it was. The 5 layered memory foam feels good on the back and the rest of my body, it conforms really well to my back and for my wife\'s. It doesn\'t sink at all in the middle nor is it uneven in pressure (like the edges compared to the center). The comfort level extends to the cooling factor on it, for I was afraid that it was going to create a lot of heat for me. Well, it is very breathable and allows air flow to work well on my body.

First of all I actually have had zero pain since I started sleeping on your mattress which says a lot. Second, One of my pillows I use for my flank and stomach for certain side and stomach sleeping positions has been removed entirely because your bed makes it unnecessary. It feels as though no matter how my body lies, it\'s not going to be uncomfortable in any way. Third, memory foam for me sleeps kind of hot and feels awkward while turning at night due to the deep impression my body makes, and your mattress does not have that problem. I have stayed cool all night (which is almost unscientific for me) and quick turning produces no strange sensation or result. I feel like I\'m sleeping on something familiar yet entirely exotic at the same time. Finally, overall the mattress is quite beautiful, especially for the price I paid.

It\'s perfectly great to sleep on, and I\'m satisfied. However, the corners did not completely inflate, and one corner barely inflated at all. It sleeps awesome, but it looks a little wonky lol.

I thought that that was rather strange, as the mattress is packed in two separate layers of plastic and both layers were INTACT upon receipt. I sprinkled a generous amount of food-grade diatomaceous earth on the entire mattress and let it sit for a few hours, then vacuumed it off. No problems after that.AND - I would caution that it would be better to have a second person during the unwrapping. I had no choice but to do it myself. The instruction sheet states that the mattress is eager to leave the confines of the plastic wrap. I like the tongue-in-cheek instructions (!) but ""eager"" is quite the understatement and I would instead describe it as ""desperate"" or even ""wantonly flings"" itself out of the packaging. And that it did! And it ended up being upside down since the mattress was rolled up with the top surface facing the outside of the roll. Thus, my bony old self was engaged with having to flip over a king-sized mattress (yup, you guessed it) by myself.And I have no idea which part of the mattress has ""organic cotton"" in it, as neither of the two tags sewn to the mattress reference the term, despite the term being printed on the top of the mattress.It\'s a five-star mattress in a four-star process.

The build quality and luxurious materials used are high grade. Overall, the Sapira is a class act.Day 1: The mattress arrives in a tall square-box, about 2x2x4. I attached a photo of what the mattress looks like compressed inside the box. Upon placing the mattress on my boxspring, I cut the plastic off and the bed immediately sprung to life, literally, as the coils decompressed. Yes, there is a noticeable off-gassing smell, but it\'s not offensive. I left my window open at night, and 90% of the smell was gone by the next morning.Day 2: At first, the mattress was a bit firm, but after about 24-36 hours the mattress had fully decompressed and was much more comfortable. It\'s probably a 6.5/7 out of 10 on the firmness scale, the way most online professional mattress websites suggest. The top Avena foam layer sleeps cool, so I don\'t overheat. The bounce the Avena foam + the pocketed coils provide makes moving around, and getting out of bed effortless. The off-gassing smell is just about gone now.Day 3: Decided to get rid of my old mattress and keep the Sapira. I sleep mostly on my back, but sometimes on my side and stomach throughout the night. The only sleep position I thought wasn\'t going to work out was the side position, because of the firmness, but the 3 inches of Avena + memory foam actually provide just enough sinkage, while keeping my spine aligned. The off-gassing smell is completely gone now. I bought a mattress protector, and then my bed sheet goes over that to complete the package.When I bought this mattress last Sunday, there were 20 left in stock with Amazon. As of this morning, only 9 Queen-size beds were left in stock, while some sizes other than Queen were already out of stock. So clearly word is getting out about this mattress. At $1,325, it\'s also a lot less expensive than every other hybrid mattress on the market, most of which will cost at least $2,000 more than this one, and will require you going to a showroom, and taking time off work to be home for delivery.In conclusion, I highly recommend this mattress. Please feel free to ask me any direct questions on here. Also, if you have time, I recommend reading the review on Sleepopolis, as it\'s the most comprehensive professional review that matches my own experience.Update: although I bought a Claritin mattress protector, and although when I called Sapira customer service they recommended having one too, I removed it on Day 4. It added a ""plastic"" feel to the surface of the bed that became unbearable. Once I removed it, that initial softness I experienced on Day 1 came back again. I only intend to use just my bedsheet from here on out. I recommend you do the same.((On a side note, I suggest ignoring the only other two reviews on here, both two stars. Unlike myself, neither one is a confirmed buyer of this product. The first review is too short to be real for a legitimate mattress evaluation by an actual customer. The fact that this mattress has the firmness rating it does shows the Sapira is designed for superior back support, so the reviewer\'s complaint is illogical. The second review is also partially off topic, as they discuss the manufacturers\'s website, which has nothing to do with how the mattress feels. Yes, they are correct the mattress is a little firm, but every other online review already confirms this. So to slam the product with only two stars for performing how it was designed is unfair.))', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 2, 2017', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars good quality and definitely med firm', 'author': 'KC', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I've slept on this mattress now for a week and am very pleased with its level of firmness.

Despite its many merits, I have deducted one star due to the size being slightly less than expected for a king-size bed.Pros:Soft Plush Feel: The mattress delivers on its promise of a soft plush feel. The memory foam provides a comfortable and supportive surface that conforms to the body, contributing to a restful and rejuvenating sleep experience.Quality Construction: The overall construction of the mattress is commendable. The memory foam layers are well-designed to offer the right balance of support and comfort, and the white/grey color scheme adds a touch of modern elegance to the bedroom.Minimal Motion Transfer: One notable advantage is the minimal motion transfer. This feature ensures that disturbances are minimized when there is movement on one side of the bed, making it an excellent choice for couples.Affordable Price: The Amazon Basics Memory Foam Mattress offers good value for money. It provides the comfort and quality associated with higher-priced mattresses at a more affordable cost.Cons:Size Discrepancy: The mattress size fell slightly short of expectations for a king-size bed. While the discrepancy is not significant, it may be noticeable to those accustomed to a more standard king-size mattress.Suggestions for Improvement:Ensure Accurate Sizing: Improving the accuracy of mattress sizing to align more closely with industry standards would enhance customer satisfaction and eliminate any size-related concerns.Conclusion:The Amazon Basics Memory Foam Mattress is a solid choice for those seeking a comfortable and budget-friendly sleep solution. Its soft plush feel, quality construction, minimal motion transfer, and affordable price make it a compelling option for various sleep preferences.While the slight size discrepancy is a consideration, it does not significantly detract from the overall positive experience with this mattress.

But you\'re supposed to spend a third of your life on. Well that\'s no good!Well let\'s make it simple. Foam mattresses are the best currently on the market. Period. The spine support they offer. They run significantly cooler, this one especially. Durability. Quite. Ease of use (no box springs). Let me make this very clear the foam mattresses win every way over other mattress types. The only con to one is they might smell for a day or 2 when you first get it but it quickly goes away.Okay great so foam it is. Now firmness what\'s the right one for me. Good question in fact this is the number one priority for a mattress. What happens too often you want to sleep on a cloud or a pillow. Absolutely not. What happens on the super soft mattresses is you\'re swallowed by it and your back isn\'t properly supported/decompressing. THIS IS MEGA SUPER IMPORTANT. What happens is when your back is arched like that the vertebrae of your spine touch and here comes the back pain. The only time a super soft mattress is recommended is for a super light child 60 lbs or less. I\'m 135 lbs 5\'9, scrawny and still too much for even me. Reason being is because the child being so light won\'t sink into the mattress which will give good spine support and gravity can do it\'s job. It\'s all about the spine.This mattress sits a medium firm. Going more towards firm and is absolutely wonderful. My first night I switched from the squishy cloud mattress to this. My back laid flat and gravity allowed it stretch out and decompress. I was literally gasping for air equivalent to a good massage over how much my back was compressed over the years.This mattress is perfect for the average consumer. I will say heavier folks go with a firmer option. This one runs cool. Easy to change sheets on. Priced unbelievable! Can\'t say enough good.

I purposely bought an extra firm Ikea mattress (8/10) because I had a super soft foam mattress (2/10) prior to that one, which I believe is where my back pain started. To be honest, I wasn’t a believer of the special engineering of these kinds of mattresses and thought the major reason for my pain were due to past injuries, work and personal related stress.As time went on, the pain got worse. I went to see a chiropractor and an acupuncture specialist and it wasn’t working. So I started to work out and do regularly back stretches. The pain got even worse, especially in the mornings. I’ve looked for numerous ways to cure myself and even wore a back brace for a year.I’ve researched for the past 9 months for a self-cure and one of the last things on my list was to change my newly bought super firm mattress. I read on health.com that people with back pain shouldn’t actually sleep on firmer mattresses, but should sleep on a softer foam/latex mattress at a firmness level of (6.5/10). So after reviewing multiple mattresses for months, I was about to get the Bear Hybrid Mattress as it seemed to me that athletes appreciated the recovery the Bear mattress provided them. I then found a review on tuck.com about the Casper original and how it’s best for light weight sleepers. Digging deeper, I found the Casper original hybrid, a 1/2 foam and 1/2 coils mattress with firmer zone support and longer lasting materials compared to the original. I found the Casper hybrid at an even cheaper price on Amazon then Casper’s official website and shipping would only take 2 days, rather than 2 weeks.2 days later, the Casper hybrid arrives outside my door in a well packed, tall large box. It was heavy but I was able to manage it myself. I wiped it down before opening it on my bed frame. It expanded within seconds and I was very surprised that there was no smell at all. I gave the new mattress a wipe down and let it sit for a few hours before trying it. (I read that we should let a new mattress sit for 24-48 hours but this Casper hybrid was ready to go out of the box.)2 hours later, I woke up realizing that I passed out while trying out the new mattress. I remember laughing with pure happiness before passing out. I felt like I was sleeping on bouncy clouds while gently being placed on top of it. The support for my shoulder and lower back dissolved the pain I had for years almost immediately. I thought to myself, I should have got this sooner.After sleeping on the Casper hybrid for the last couple days, the pain I use to wake up with every morning has disappeared 95%. Along with doing my daily stretches and massages, I wake up every morning 100% a brand new man. Thank you for curing my back pain!-Firmness Level 5.5-5.7/10.-No smell and ready to use out of the box.-Bouncy cloud feeling while gently being placed on top of it.-Great zone support and pressure relief.-Best for light weight and average weight sleepers.-Im a front sleeper, but I sleep on my back and sides very comfortably.-Edge support is not the best but very good considering the construction.-Mobilization transfer is not the best but good.-100 day free trail and 10 year basic warranty.-No home setup and no service to take old mattress away due to Covid.-Amazon is cheaper and has faster shipping options.I hope my honest review could help some of you out there.

I narrowed my searches and reviews from this 9"" and a Zinus 10"" I was also interested in. I decided on this one because it had the cooling gel and I remember having had a queen bed with the cooling gel foam and how nice it was..not so much as a sleeping cool for me but a very refreshing sleep I guess. Anyways I couldn\'t beat the price of this matress! It was right in the budget but I was worried it would be either too firm or too plush. A lot of the reviews gave my mixed emotions on it. I took my chances and bought it anyway. It arrived in a large box (think half size of a coffin) the matress was rolled up tight and compacted. I pulled it out and layed it on the floor. Took the main plastic off so I could unfold. Once I was able to unfold it it immediately started to retrieve air. SO COOL!! it\'s like magic watching it go from a freeking pillow case to a thick matress! Over all I\'m incredibly happy with this matress! It\'s not too firm and not too plush (at least in my preference).Some things to note:When I took the matress out and removed all the plastic it had reach about 7-8"" in a short amount of time (this is a 9"") . I gave it about 15-20 hours before really judging It but also to give it time to really expand as well. They say you should give a memory foam matress 24-48 hours to fully expand. I left and got home 3 hours later, lifted it up and put against the wall knowing I\'d be moving furniture the next day. When I lifted it it felt much denser. And I was a little shocked. Prior, I had laid on it and at first was worried cause it felt really plush to me. Like TOO plush. I told myself I should give it time to expand. And wow the base foam really must of or the whole thing cause it feels way more sturdy and supporting yet very comfortable. All in all. Big recommend. I will say that I will be buying a bunker board for an additional support/air circulation for under this mates aired to raise it just a few more inches. If you have a Murphy bed I recommend the same. If the bed is a foam bed and placed flat on the support board it can cause mold.

However, I was on a budget because I was moving away from home. I didn\'t want to spend $600+ for a mattress. So, with that in mind, I came to amazon looking for a ""Gel-memory foam mattress."" It got delivered in a box that was about 5 feet tall and a foot wide. I was even more skeptical because how could they fit such a large mattress in such a small box. Well, after unboxing the mattress, I plopped in on the floor and waited about 3 hours for it to puff up. I bought this over a year ago and I literally have not have one bad night of sleep since. I\'ve had friends come over and ask where I bought the mattress from because it is that comfortable. They are always shocked when I say I got it from amazon and are even more shocked when I tell them the price I got it at. Whenever I ask my friends how much they think I bought it for, they always say something in the ballpark of $500+ when actually the cost is almost 1/3 of that! I\'ve slept on many very expensive mattresses (including my parents tempur-pedic) but I have to tell the truth, this mattress beats all of them. It is literally like sleeping on a cloud, and I have never had any pain waking up. Actually I have a lot of trouble waking up because the mattress is just so comfortable that you don\'t really want to get up. The one drawback is that it is only 7 inches thick. But at this point in my life, I don\'t really need a 10 inch mattress which would be a pain to carry around when I move from place to place. I am not a bed connoisseur by any means and don\'t really know if the gel really does actually keep me cool at night but hey, I\'ve never had a bad night of sleep so I guess that answers my questions. And for the record, I cannot stand sleeping when its hot and I\'m sweaty, so it must mean it does a decent job of keeping me cool at night.If you are in the market for a very affordable, yet comfortable, mattress, look no further. You will not regret it. I\'ve referred many of my friends to this mattress and they also say that it is the best $180 that they have ever spent in their lives.

A key reason for choosing the 7 in gel memory foam was for the ‘stay cool’ affect. After sleeping on this for over a week in mid-summer weather, I was pleased to find that it lived up to that claim and I did not notice any hot spots. The mattress is comfortable and compares well to an expensive, name-brand pillow top I have had at home for about 10 years. It is several times more comfortable than the mattress that came with my RV new. After unpacking it following the clear instructions and allowing it to come to shape after shipping, I placed it on top of a plywood platform with only a 1.5 pad between it and the board. It did not take long to be ready for use, although the instructions say to allow 24-48 hours. If you are considering this for your own RV, remember that this is more of a true queen size mattress and will be longer than a ""camper"" queen. I found that it was not too heavy or awkward to lift with or to take off the platform as needed. Since this is memory foam, the mattress doesn’t sink or flatten down much and stays at its advertised 7 inches. This is true even for a plus-size person and an 80lb dog both sleeping on it. I would also recommend that you make sure you can climb up onto this mattress at that height, and that you have enough head room if you are putting this in an RV with cabinets over the bed.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States July 7, 2016', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Never slept better', 'author': 'Sierra', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'So I’ve had this mattress for about 2 months now and it’s the best decision I’ve made.

The only bad thing I can say about it is that I’m a hot sleeper and this is supposed to have cooling gel. I don’t feel the cooling gel whatsoever but you have to take into consideration I bought a waterproof mattress cover and have no ac in my home so maybe when it gets colder that will be more helpful through the night. The motion transfer isn’t too bad but it’s a hell of a lot better than my old spring mattress. I would give it a 7.

I switched to this from a very firm mattress hoping memory foam would be like sleeping on a cloud...it isnt. This mattress is not soft at all, it is soft to the touch but only the top inch and a half is memory foam. The next layer is a high density foam for support. So sleeping on this is not very soft at all. I do think it is better than the mattress than I had before as I had slept on it for 7 years and it was just done. This one is still in great condition even with the 3 years sleeping on it. It has also survived a very active toddler jumping on it all the time even still it is the same as when I got it.

For kids, a disposable waterproof pad(like the ones used for potty training dogs) could easily be slipped inside. Lots of pics in my review, here are thoughts:Came rolled up and compressed. Immediately began expanding upon opening, a good sign. I removed the foam to help the process go faster, so that the edges and corners weren’t slowed by the cover. The cover was easy to put back on, but is not loose or baggy at all.The foam inside has two layers. A higher density white foam on the bottom and a softer blue foam on the top. All in all, quite comfortable to lay on.The length and width are spot on to the advertised measurements. Part of my 4-star rating came from the thickness. This is advertised as a 4” thick pad, and it only is 3.5”. If you’re wondering if half an inch really would make much more of a difference, talk to any man you know ;-). Not enough to send it back, but really not accurate.The other reason for the 4-star is that it lacks any Velcro straps to hold it closed when folded. These would make it easier to store and carry. It didn’t advertise this, but they’re on all other tri-folds I’ve used and would make handling easier.All in all a very good pad. 4 stars, but the two things I mentioned are minor to most people.

After 2 years it started losing air every few hours and my guests would end up sleeping on the floor on top of the deflated mattress. These foldable mattresses ended up being my solution to that problem. They fold up quite nicely and I really like that they come with a zip up storage bag to keep them in. I ended up buying two of them as I felt it would be easier to store two twin size mattresses then one huge queen size mattress. I would like to note that the zip up storage bag is a little tricky to figure out how to use, but once you get the mattress in the right way it zips up very nicely.I found these extremely comfortable to sleep on, however I'm able to sleep on the floor with no problem.

AMAZING!!!', 'author': 'Emily', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'TLDR; Definitely buy this mattress if you want to sleep on a squishy cloud every night.First off I want to say, I read a ton of mixed reviews before clicking buy and was quite nervous! I researched for months!!!I haven\'t bought a new bed of my own before, let alone a bed that comes in a box. I really was so confused by the reviews. Some were raving and many hated this bed. I got tired of researching and going around in circles with every other good and bad review, so finally just decided to click buy on this one: 10"" Queen.It arrived in a box just shorter than me. (I\'m 5\'2"", extremely difficult for me to carry the box alone into the house, but I managed!) I was a bit skeptical that this sealed mattress in this box would expand to an actual queen size and 10"" thickness. I followed the instructions on how to open and get set up. Definitely follow these instructions and don\'t accidentally cut the plastic layer keeping the mattress compressed -until ready for it to expand- or the mattress itself. Cutter tool was included, which was very useful!!Once situated in the room, I cut the last layer of plastic off mattress and it immediately began to expand. I measured it for a few hours and by the end of the night it had expanded fully.I wasn\'t sure what the firmness or lack there of would be due to the reviews. I laid on it and it was extremely squishy, like very squishy -like a cloud. The first few nights my neck hurt from sinking in so much. However, I switched to a less fluffy pillow and now absolutely no back pain. I used to get out of bed and be so sore, no more with this mattress though! (Also purchased a 14"" metal platform frame off Amazon too, and that helped more with the comfort. I initially had the mattress on the floor the first week.)Only con is that, the corners aren\'t fully expanded to the usual corner shape; I don\'t think. But to me that is fine, because those 2 corners are against my wall and hidden by pillows.Now that you\'ve read this novel, just add it to your cart and get ready for a comfy, squishy bed that you just sink into like a cloud. :) A good investment at a reasonable price if you are budget shopping for a nice, convenient mattress. Also, great that there\'s no hauling required, ships right to your doorstep.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States November 5, 2021', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Good mattress , comfortable , but one important thing...', 'author': 'John Paul DeMaio', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'Its a good mattress , its comfortable, but very important i had to note for others it is bigger then a full size. I have a full size bed frame as you see , and it did not fit in the frame . It over hung about an inch and a half on each side. This was a NIGHTMARE for me cause i purchased the bed , set it up (heavy as heck) and all was ready to go and then this. I didnt know what to do. What i ended up doing was , instead of scraping the bed and losing all that money , time and work and buying another bed (because you are never in a billion years getting the mattress back in the box to return it) , i built this bed up above the frame and then just put the mattress on top of that. So im about 62 feet off the floor and need a parachute to get off the bed in the morning , but at least there was a solution. So just beware if you have a tight bed frame and you order this mattress you may be in for a rough time trying to figure out how to get it to fit. OR, it may be perfect. I of course ""googled"" the issue and it seems to be a common problem amongst many mattress and bed company\'s that they vary allot in sizes from what they consider ""full queen king etc"". Otherwise i love the mattress it\'s thick it\'s cozy it goes back to shape when you get off. I would definitely get the ""firm"" cause even the firm i sink into so the lighter ones are probably a marshmellow which to me is very uncomfortable.

Every couple weeks our sheets and blankets would come down with the same smell and I’d have to wash them in vinegar to get the smell out. But the smell always came back. About 2 months ago it became obvious that the smell was coming directly from this mattress. Any time I removed the mattress protector and sheets to wash, the smell would permeate our room. The final straw for me was a week ago when I linked significant breathing problems to sleeping on the mattress.I was suspicious from the beginning that this smell was mold. I have diagnosed CIRS and mold illness and this year our family had to get rid of our house and all our belongings due to off the charts findings of toxic mold that were making all 4 of us very sick.

With everything else we\'re trying to do we weren\'t ready to drop several thousand dollars on a super expensive bed yet. This mattress seem to fit our needs.It contours your body like a memory foam mattress should, but I feel like it is not very responsive. As such, when you switch positions or sleep next to someone I believe it may offset the mattress\'s ability to relieve pressure points. This is a mattress in which I feel you definitely sink into, rather than float above.The first night I slept on this mattress I still woke with a bit of a stiff back, but the second night was awful. I woke up the following morning more sore than I ever have from a mattress. Having read several reviews from people saying it takes a week or so to adjust to a new mattress I toughed it out for a few weeks. Unfortunately, we are still waking sore. Luckily, Amazon is allowing us to return it.My husband and I both have issues with our backs, me also with my hips, and we just may need a more firm mattress. This may be a good mattress for you if you are a side sleeper who likes a more plush mattress or if you sleep alone (my hubby works away from home quite a bit and I found I didn\'t wake quite as sore when he was gone or the kids didn\'t crawl into bed with me- still sore, but not as bad).

He didn\'t want to spend the money, and any time I would catch him stretching his back in pain he would play it off like it was nothing. FINALLY I convinced him to look at mattresses with me, and not only that, but I must have laid out a very persuasive proposal, for I talked him into upsizing to a King! So, we ventured out one weekend to a local Ashley Furniture store to begin getting a ballpark figure on how much this investment would run us, being that we had to now purchase a new bed frame as well. The sales lady, when I questioned her about the therapeutic and memory foam type mattresses, informed me that a King size purchase of that type would run us well over 2-grand for the mattress set alone. Well, needless to say I put that option out of my head, and we narrowed our search to only spring mattress sets. I found myself leaning toward a mattress set of either the Sealy or Serta brand, so the sales representative estimated a total that included the mattress, box springs, and a bed frame we were fond of, and the total was near two-grand. We told her we would think about it and we left the store.Thus began my search online to see if I could find one of the mattresses we had tested, and liked, at a cheaper price. I went to my trustworthy friend of Amazon, and so happened to run across the Sleep Innovations Memory Foam Mattress. I didn\'t understand how a King size memory foam mattress could be so cheap - It baffled me! As one could assume, I was very skeptic. ""There\'s no way this could be good quality"" I thought. So out of curiosity I looked at the number of reviews. At the time it had only about 60 reviews, and over 50 of them were 5/5 - and the reviews were of happy satisfied people who were extremely glad they took the chance on this mattress. Now I had a truly difficult decision to make. I originally didn\'t want to purchase a mattress online that we hadn\'t lain on in person - understandably I didn\'t want to waste our money on a mattress we hated - but this mattress was such a good price, and I had always wanted a memory foam mattress (I had a pillow of this brand and loved it).Finally, after reading probably almost every review on Amazon about this mattress, I decided to throw caution to the wind and purchase this mattress (the boyfriend had left picking out the mattress to me, as choosing between hundreds of mattresses turned out not to be `his thing\' to do on the weekends - and he claimed it to be something a woman would enjoy. HAH!) Besides, anything was an improvement to what were sleeping on at the time.The mattress arrived earlier than the initial estimated arrival date, and I had even chosen free super saver shipping (it arrived exactly 1 full week after I ordered it - I ordered it on a Friday, and it arrived the following Friday). I already expected a small box, in comparison to the size of the mattress, but when I opened the box and dragged the mattress out, despite my knowledge from previous customer reviews, I was still shocked. I knew it was compressed, but still it only looked like half of a king size mattress folded accordion style - It looked like a twin! ""Surely,"" I thought, ""I didn\'t make some mistake and I was supposed to have purchased two of these...maybe that is why it was so cheap."" But alas, my fears were proven unnecessary. After reading the instructions on how to properly remove it from the plastic in which it was sealed, I sliced it open and it grew rapidly before my eyes! Not only was it compressed accordion style, it had been folded in half like a sub sandwich as well! This is a mammoth of a mattress, so I recommend anyone who purchases it to open it up in the location you intend to leave it (the UPS tracking said it weight around 105lbs).It has almost been a full month since we purchased this mattress, and we are simply in love. I could almost swear that not even a few days have gone by without either my boyfriend or I remarking on how amazing it is. Some people complained about a lingering smell. It did in fact have a chemical-like smell upon opening, but after about 2-3 days it was fully gone. Even so, during those 3-days the smell was certainly not unbearable as some thought, but actually had very mild potency, and we slept on it the first night without any trouble.Also related to the first night, I was a bit worried we would have to sleep on the downstairs sofas the day it arrived, because we had a dinner date we couldn\'t miss, so I was unable to assemble the bed frame (which had arrived the same day) and unseal the mattress until 9:00pm. By the time I had finished assembling the bed and laying the box springs (two XL-Twins) in their place, it was 10:00pm. After we cut the seal, however, it was quickly apparent that it would take no time for it to expand. It was done in 30minutes or less! There may have been additional minor expansion that went on unnoticed to us, but for the most part it was finished (and the instructions actually say it will be ready to sleep on the first night, and that body warmth actually speeds up the process).I will never go back to a box-spring mattress again. Your body sinks right into this one as soon as you lay down. It has never been more comfortable to sit in bed and read a book before going to sleep. Also, on our old bed I used to wake up frequently through-out the night when the cats jumped on the bed, my back pained me, or when nature called. Now, however, I never even notice when the cats or my boyfriend move around in the bed, never wake up with back pains, and only wake up for bathroom calls if it is absolutely necessary. I find myself sleeping straight through the night until my alarm goes off for work, a blessing I haven\'t had in years.Some think foam mattresses are too firm, but they only appear to be at first. Once you sit/lay on them you begin to sink in. So it is firm, but it yields and molds to your body, something I find much more beneficial and comfortable than a soft mattress with no support. Also I can not attest to the mattress causing an increase or decrease in temperature caused by body heat or anything of that matter. I have noticed no difference.I am a thousand times grateful I took a chance on this mattress, and I would highly urge anyone who is debating on the matter to do so themselves!', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States March 14, 2011', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Sound, comfortable regenerative sleep, finally! No more springs here. 2 yrs. later... Great!', 'author': 'Uwohali', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Originally ordered on 3/23 and it never came, lost? I called 3/28 and spoke with supervisor Heather, she quickly resolved the problem on 3/28 and the following day my mattress arrived. Heather tracked the order and sent emails as it shipped, now that\'s outstanding customer service! Thsank you so much Heather. UPDATE : It\'s been a couple of months now and the mattress is very comfortable still. We have a steel raised frame with a smooth finished plywood 3/8"" top. There are additional support blocks at various points on the raised frame to make sure it is completely supported. Seems that a lot of reviews relate problems to improper frame and support of it. With the mattress supported as such we haven\'t had a problem with it at all. It does sleep warm, so we had to adjust the amount of covers we used to use with the Serta boxspring it replaced. I will update the review again at a later date. This mattress sleeps so much better than boxspring construction, just adjust your top sheets and covers accordingly since you\'ll get warmer than a boxspring.The mattress arrived in a large 2\' X 2\' box about 4\'tall, heavy but manageable, around 100lbs., so be ready :). Boy does it inflate fast too. It had a slight curve as some have pictured, but given time to properly expand it straightened out flat. Odor was very, very faint to where you had to lay on it to really notice it and even then it was faint, guess it depends on the individuals sensitivity. After a day or so it was not noticeable to us at all. It fit our elevated queen platform perfectly, so sized correctly. It\'s kind of weird after using conventional spring mattresses all my life, at first you\'re like ""man... It\'s like sleeping on a board lol"", but given several days and it\'s like ""I will never, ever have a box spring again lol""... it is actually like that... I suggest first timers like me... moving from springs to foam to give it several days for your body to adjust to something brand new to it. Compared to the Serta Fairmont Pillow Top it replaced it is simply superior, the bottom line is I sleep sound and comfortable now, I did not with two previous Sertas. I wish I had went this route earlier, solid, comfortable, all night sleeping now. The price isn\'t the issue, it comes down to what gives you this type of sound & comfortable regenerative sleep. Recommended.Update : 3 weeks later. Takes some getting used to because it forms to you quite nicely. It does sleep warmly, meaning it reflects your body heat into the covers. This is no problem to me, a simple covers adjustment... just wanted to note this. I have quite sound, solid rests now that the Serta Pillow Top wasn\'t producing. This alone to me is worth the money easily... I mean you buy a mattress for comfort and good sleep, this mattress performs that. Will update at later date.Update : 10/28/16 Well it\'s been quite some time and the mattress is still performing as it should. Did a rotation at six months too. We\'re both sleeping quite comfortably and one thing I\'ve noticed is I now get quite solid sleep, something I didn\'t get with box\'s prints. The mattress has softened very slightly but in a comfortable way to me. No imprinted patterns or irregular shapes either. Still very happy with this purchase, you could easily pay 2-3 times or more and not get the practical function you have here.6/09/17 Update : It\'s been a year and three months, no complaints and sleeping wonderful still. The one thing I have noticed is the mattress sleeps warm... Reflects body heat... so I\'ve learned to turn the quilt down and use the sheet on my upper half. My girlfriend loves it just as is and sleeps like a baby. Again, never ever again boxsrings.Update: 2/21/18 It\'s been two years now. The mattress has held up quite nicely with no sags, low spots, and still sleeps great. We rotate it every three to four months and haven\'t had a problem. It is heavy to rotate, but to me that\'s a sign that it is well made. Two years of great sleep VS years of springs... Never ever again. There are companies selling the equivalent to this mattress at over four to eight times as much, why pay that? I look at it like this... If it lasts five years I will be totally happy for the price paid. I will likely order another soon for a second room after this great two years performance we\'ve received.

Harmon', 'rating': 4, 'content': ""Matress came in a fairly large box with an outer sleeve and inner plastic cover. Instructions were easy to follow but you can also find Youtube videos on how to do the process. Basically amounts to cutting off the outer sleeve then placing the mattress on your box spring and then opening the plastic seal, it will quickly take on a lot of air as it expands. Per the directions once this is done you can use the bed normally but it may take some time to fully expand. We let ours expand for about 5 hours, I noticed a slight smell but turned on an aircleaner and that went away very quickly. Overall I dont know why so many review it as firm, the under foam is firm however the top layer is quite soft and easy to depresses with your hand. When you lay flat and your weight is distributed it does feel a little more firm but you do slowly sink into the same way your head does on a memory foam pillow. I still wouldn't classify it as firm, at best medium firm on top layer. Overall its very comfortable and is an excellent value. I found I was not hot and Im sensitive to heat. The only time I did notice it was a little uncomfortable was if I rolled on my belly which is not my normal sleeping position. I was just testing all the angles. If heat is a problem which in Houston heat is always a problem you could also add a Mattress topper, they make a number of styles and I ordered an encryption cotton one that hasn't come in yet due to the reviews that said this mattress could get hot. We havent gotten to the dead of summer yet so I will have to add an update for when we do, I will likely use the topper I ordered just to compare and to have a little extra protection for the Mattress. I like having a little airflow around my body. Im not sure why the manufacture couldn't put little Do-nut holes in top foam to improve this but it hasn't been a problem yet for me. They do include air vents in the cover over the foam, and the info that came with it says the top foam should vent well stay cool. I'm not sure how as it seems solid which is why I ordered the mattress cover that has good ventilation. So far it hasn't been needed and the mattress seems adequate, it passed the wife test too which is the most important test! I will update this review once we have slept on the mattress for a longer period but initial review is good.>> Update, we are now mostly through January and we both are enjoying this mattress. We do use an Egyptian cotton mattress topper which definitely improves the air flow around your body rather then just slowly sinking into the soft foam top. Honestly that makes it seem very similar to a traditional mattress, when sitting on a corner or side you do notice its not as firm as a traditional mattress such as when tying your shoes in the morning. Despite that minor quibble, the bed is very comfortable and is standing up to 100 degree weather and high humidity Houston Texas days. My kids even love it and constantly want to come in our room to watch TV. Essentially its passed the whole family test and we look forward to having this Mattress for years to come. I also feel it should help with Allergies as its not going to absorb dust like a traditional mattress. Given that we are using a topper that may need to be replaced every so often but it wasn't expensive and allows for us to have an additional comfort boost. I could have honestly used the mattress without it, but due to some of the heat complaints I figured best to get that to allow a touch more airflow. I like it cold and my wife likes it warm and with this setup we both have been pleased. All in All a solid 4, not quite as good as my old mattress however that was also 4X more expensive so this budget shopper is happy."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 31, 2013', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Truth, this mattress rocks!', 'author': 'Axel Foley', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Okay, so here was my situation. When my pillow top mattress arrived years ago the delivery guys said they could not get it upstairs into my bedroom because they would have to bend it in order to get it up the stairs. Well, the sales guy at the store said the mattress could bend in order to fit it up the stairs so we told the delivery guys to just ""get it up there!"" They did and everything was fine, for awhile. Recently we noticed a large valley in the middle of the king sized, pillow top mattress. At first it was no big deal but the last month or so, it was HORRIBLE! So, I was on the hunt for a new mattress. I knew I needed a memory foam mattress because it needed to fit up stairs. And mind you, I don\'t live in an elf house but the doorway to the upstairs is at a strange angle so no spring mattresses will work.What does everyone do when they start looking at memory foam mattresses? They look at that name brand memory foam mattress that costs thousands of dollars. I didn\'t really want to spend that much money, I mean, who does. But I would have if that was the only mattress that I felt was going to work for my wife and I. Now this part is important, I did a TON of research on the internet. No need to research folks, I did it for you! It came down to this mattress or the one available at Sam\'s Club. After doing more research and Amazon\'s great reputation, I decided to try this mattress. And I am SO GLAD that I did!I ordered the mattress and it took a week and half to get to me. No problem. The shipping was free, yes free! So how could I complain? That mattress came in a box about 4.5 feet tall and about 2 feet deep. It was heavy, about 100 lbs. I was able to get it into the house and up my stairs by myself. Any man, in any decent kind of physical shape, will be able to push, pull, carry or drag the box into their house and up stairs. Some women can do it too I am sure! Not trying to be sexist, just realistic.Anyway, I set up my new bed frame, the folding frame by Structure available and purchased from Amazon as well. This frame is great. SO EASY to put together! Just fold open and screw the two sides together done. Way easier and better for your memory foam mattress than a standard box spring. Once the frame was set up I opened the box and pulled out the mattress. The mattress will be FOLDED IN HALF and scrunched up so it looks like Z\'s from the side. It will also be in a plastic bag in which all the air has been sucked out. PUT THE MATTRESS ON THE FRAME BEFORE CUTTING OPEN THIS BAG. The down side of the mattress is blue. This is really the only part of the mattress that you will see in the bag since it is folded over. As long as the mattress is on the frame, you can turn it in the right direction after opening the bag. Carefully cut the bag open and you will start to hear the air being sucked in. The mattress will start to get bigger but no need to go super fast as you will have plenty of time to cut open the bag and pull it out from under the mattress.Once the bag is off the mattress starts to get bigger and bigger and bigger. Once it opens up you will feel bumps an dips in the mattress. Don\'t worry, after an hour or two these will no longer be there. There is a smell. The room will smell as if you recently painted the walls. This smell slowly goes away. It really is no big deal. In fact, after I made up the bed, I could barely smell it.The mattress does come with a protecter already over it but I would recommend putting your own on it as well. King size sheets went on perfectly. Hour after hour the mattress would feel better. I was really surprised how nice it felt.Okay, so I opened the mattress around 1pm. At about 10pm my wife and I went up to bed. The mattress felt like a dream! It is a bit firm but once you lay down, you will slowly melt into it. You will not sink down 6 inches or anything like that, but you will melt in an inch or so. And it will feel fantastic! The mattress did feel a bit warmer than my old one, but IT WAS NOT HOT! You really won\'t notice a big difference. I slept great last night! Way better than my last mattress! One I paid around 2 grand for!!!! What a rip!Here are some other things that I read in other reviews.It is hard to get out of the bed. Not so. You can sit on the side, move around, get in and out. No problem.""Non-sleeping activities"" are tough in this bed. Not at all. If their are problems, it ain\'t the bed!It stinks. Like I said before, like fresh paint in the room. But as of today, I smell nothing. No worries!It is too firm. I don\'t think so. I usually like soft beds. But this one has changed my mind.You must work for Amazon or Sleep Innovations. Haha. Nope. City employee who is hoping I have a pension in 20 years (fingers crossed).I had MAJOR reservations about purchasing a mattress without ever trying it. But what was I going to do? I was kinda stuck. But I pulled the trigger on this mattress and I DON\'T REGRET IT! Not one bit! If you are on the fence about purchasing this mattress, just DO IT! I have been looking at this mattress since Christmas! Yes, that long! I should have bought it then. I\'m glad I did and like one poster said, if it only lasts 5 years, so what! I can buy another one for a fraction of the cost of the ""name brand"" memory foam mattress. But I don\'t see that as being a problem because everything about this mattress is impressive.If you have any questions, I will check back and answer them for you.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 7, 2011', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars It may not be for everyone, but I love it!', 'author': 'JB', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I rarely, if ever, have the urge to write a review, but when I was considering this bed I found the reviews very helpful. I thought I should contribute my thoughts to people that were on the fence about buying this memory foam mattress.Prior to ordering this mattress, I did a lot of research online. I also thought it\'d be a great idea to go to a local Tempur Pedic store. While I was there, I tried several of the different mattresses. I wanted to really find out if I would like the comfort of the mattress. They felt firm, but very comfortable. I would recommend anyone that has not tried sleeping on a memory foam mattress to go to a local store and lay on them to see if they are your cup of tea or not. I wanted to make an informed decision about my purchase; I made sure to ask the Tempur Pedic employee any questions I had about the mattresses.Some questions asked:1) What is the biggest reason why people return their bed?-She told me that people generally returned the bed because they said it was too hard, firm, and/or not comfortable. She went on to tell me that a lot of people don\'t give the bed enough time. She stated that people should try to give the bed 8-12 weeks. Some people actually love the bed after the 8-12 week break in period.2) Do you own a memory foam mattress? If so, which one and why?-She did own one. She owned one of the higher end ""cloud"" models. She told me she selected her mattress based on the feel and comfort.3) Did you find that your sleep improved? Did the quantity and quality of sleep change significantly?-She told me that her sleep did improve. She told me she still sleeps about the same amount of time but that the quality of sleep is much better.4) Are there ""heat"" issues with the memory foam mattresses?-She states that the technology used allows very good heat dissipation. She then tells me that a lot of people that ""sleep hot"" will likely feel the same on a memory foam.5) How much do these mattresses run?-She tells me that the mattresses run several thousand dollars. She states there is financing and that it is an ""investment in your health"".6) Anything else you want to share with me regarding a new purchase?-She tells me that it would be a good idea to get a new pillow with the mattress. She states that some people find the bed uncomfortable, but once they purchase a new pillow to compliment the mattress, that it can improve the overall comfort.I knew that I wanted a memory foam mattress, but I also knew I didn\'t want to have to spend $3,000 or more. That brought me to Amazon. I read hundreds of reviews on this particular mattress and on others as well. I decided to go with this mattress mainly due to the amount of feedback and positive reviews. I figured the price was worth the risk, took the plunge (I ordered a queen size mattress).The mattress arrived 2 days after I placed my order on Amazon. The package was heavy (close to 100 lbs), but I was able to move the box and unpack the mattress by myself (I\'m not a gym rat/health nut, but I usually exercise 2-3 times per week). I live in a one story home. The mattress was relatively easy to maneuver into the bedroom. I was smart about how I lifted the box and made sure to use proper body mechanics.I carefully followed the directions to unpack the bed being particularly careful not to cut the mattress. After cutting the sleeve/plastic wrapping, the mattress expanded fairly rapidly. I have my mattress on a platform designed specifically for memory foam beds.My sense of smell is fairly sensitive. I notice the chemical smell right away, but after a few hours it seems to be dissipating and it is much less noticeable. After a few days it is completely gone.I was happy to see that I wouldn\'t have to wait 48 hours before being able to sleep on the bed. The brochure that came with the bed states that it is actually okay to sleep on the mattress the first night. It said that body heat could actually help the mattress expand into its proper form.It is difficult to rate/grade the firmness because there isn\'t a standard scale that everyone is familiar with. Not only that, but deciding what is ""firm"" is all subjective and will vary from person to person. For me the mattress is ""firm"", but not in a bad way. The foam conforms to your body and there is a sensation of pressure relief. I am getting great support and the bed feels very comfortable. Regarding heat, I have no issues whatsoever. Of course there is also the no motion transfer feature.I can honestly say this is the best sleep I\'ve gotten in a long time. I had minor back and body aches before, after sleeping on this mattress a few days I no longer have those aches. I also ended up buying a memory foam pillow. I feel that it has added comfort and quality to my sleep.Bottom line is the mattress does everything the major name brand does, but is more affordable. I don\'t regret this purchase at all. Of course it may not be for everyone... but with so many 4 and 5 star reviews, there\'s a high probability that you might find that this memory foam mattress works for you.**Update (over 2 weeks later): I still love my bed. It is very comfortable! I would make this purchase again. I have been getting improved quality of sleep. I toss and turn way less, get up less during the night, and wake up without aches or back pain.**Update (over 2 months later): The bed still feels comfortable.

So lets get these out of the way. Yes the mattress comes in a box. It\'s folded up, vacuum packed and wrapped in a band. The box a bit larger than a mini fridge. It weighs around 90 pounds. The foam does have a smell. Depending on how sensitive you are to it will depend on how you rate the product. It is just the smell of new foam. It will dissipate, how fast depends on room temp, ventilation and other environmental factors.So now that I have the simple, mostly unimportant things covered, I will give you some background. My ex-wife insisted on spending 2500$ on a Tempur-pedic mattress when we were together 3 years ago or so. I was NOT happy about the cost, especially when there were many lower priced products on the market similar to this mattress. So I slept on a Tempur brand for a year or so. It was built differently than this mattress. The top layer(s) were much softer and you really sunk in before you hit the ""support"" layer of foam. I found myself in a snuggled dip, making rolling over at night difficult and usually found that I was woken up by the struggle. The mattress was hot too. Let me tell you I was a sweat factory every night. It was nice in the winter time, however. But all in all I was comfortable and had little to no back or neck pain. This was the least I could expect, considering the fact that I spend a good sum of money on a premium mattress. One of the few things I will mention (probably just my own body issues) is that if I didn\'t pee before bed, you can bet your bottom dollar that I would wake up in the morning with a sore back and having to run to the bathroom. I just got used to going beforehand and never had any issues. Also something people don\'t touch on AT ALL is the subject of intimacy. We all pretty much participate in this activity on this particular household item exclusively, and no one really talks about the differences between springs vs. foam. On the Tempur mattress the fact that you sunk in quite a bit with no give made bedroom activities a constant game changer. If anyone had issues with joints, or needing to be at a certain level or position during this activity would have to pretty much find another surface to have these activities on.And with that background being covered I can move on. My new wife and I moved out to Maine from the Pacific Northwest, selling all our belongings and started fresh. We hit town and bought some furniture, and a mattress at the same time from the same dealer. It was a discount mattress and believe me after 2 months we knew we got what we paid for. Sagging center and broken springs. We spoke of our options and discussed foam. I had experience with it, however refused to pay 2,000$ for a mattress. We shopped around locally, even hitting the sleep number store in our local mall. Their memory foam was a bit firmer than what I had before, but the tilt/massage and air adjustability was very enticing, then I got the 5600$ price and walked out. We are both thrifty and big Amazon shoppers so we turned here. We shopped Sams Club and Costco also and decided on this mattress. Ordered it on Friday Oct 19th and it was at our door before noon the next day. Amazon will always have the best delivery and service. We unpacked the bed at noon and slept on it that night. The smell was already almost gone by our 9 o\'clock bedtime. We settled right in on the firmest bed either of us has ever slept on. It was a terribly uncomfortable frist night. Our pillows were not supportive enough either. We woke up Sunday, assessed the situation and went right out to Sams Club and dropped 80$ on a soft 1.5"" foam topper, installed it and have the mattress of our dreams. A nice shallow cushy layer that supports with the firmness we desire. We sleep cool, we are isolated from eachothers movements and let me tell you, the firmness and the fact that you don\'t ""sink"" into the mattress have opened our eyes to a whole new world in the romance department. Having a bed that does not move all over on bouncy springs really amplifies the energy you put into the pleasure.I will leave it at that. I will also be very critical of this purchase and will update this review as often as something comes to light worth mentioning. But for now, we got an amazing mattress. It may not be perfect out of the box, but with products available anywhere you can tailor this to your own sleep style with little investment. This is a great mattress with an AMAZING price. I love it more than the Tempur brand that was almost 5 times more expensive.Enjoy!!Update (3-4-13) We have been sleeping on this mattress for a tick over 4 months now. Every night my wife and I look forward to our sleep! We have ""rotated"" the mattress twice now (end to end, not flipping it over, as you can only sleep on the top surface) for no other reason than to just prevent us from possibly sinking the mattress (absolutely no sign of that). One evening I was washing the cover for our 2"" mattress topper and we lost power in the middle of it. We decided to sleep on just the mattress and without the topper. Same as the first night we woke up stiff and achey. This mattress alone is still just too firm without the 2"" soft layer that the extra topper provides. I would still recommend this mattress to anyone, since you can customize the sleep with a small investment in a topper.Update (3-8-14) It\'s been well over a year now, and this bed has become our favorite place in the house. About 5 months ago we decided to remove the foam topper and sleep directly on the bed, because I was, for some reason, tossing and turning which shifted the topper, causing me to have part of my body on the topper and then my shoulders would fall and contact the mattress. I can only think that after almost a year of sleeping on the mattress, it ""softened"" up enough to where we felt the bed was the same firmness without the topper. Picked up some 600 thread count luxury sheets and we could never imagine not sleeping on this bed. Still stand by my rating and recommend it.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 23, 2012', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Sleeps Like A Dream: Especially if you suffer from Back Problems or Restless Leg Syndrome', 'author': 'R. Douglas', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I have to say, I was wary of a mail order foam mattress, but the Sleep Innovations 12-in Shiloh mattress has exceeded all my expectations!!After injuring my back in 2005 and subsequently developing restless leg syndrome, sleeping the last 15 years had been a nightmare for both my wife and I. We had always slept on spring mattresses and found they quickly sagged and became lumpy and had to be replaced every couple of years...and mattresses aren\'t cheap. On the spring mattress, I\'d have a few months of great sleep which quickly deteriorated as the bed sagged, putting pressure on my spinal nerves causing all sorts of on-going pain and discomfort. The only way I could sleep was to prop pillows in front of me and behind me to keep me perfectly on my side. Plus, my night time muscle spasms and twitching from the restless leg syndrome amounted to interrupted sleep for my spouse. It was just an overall miserable experience for both of us.Of course, a well-known brand name memory foam mattress company claimed unrivaled sleep and comfort, especially with those of us with back problems and restless sleepers. However, we just could not afford the price tag.Introducing Sleep Innovations: February 2016, my wife and I just could not tolerate another night on our lumpy queen spring mattress. Now she was also in constant pain from back problems (probably due to the spring mattress). During hours of research, trying to find an affordable mattress, we kept running across favorable reviews of a memory foam mattress called Sleep Innovations. After more weeks of hesitancy over buying a mail order mattress, sight unseen, we decided to take, hold our breath, the plunge and order the Shiloh from Amazon. We debated the merits of the other models from Sleep Innovations and decided to place our bets on the model that had the most reviews - the Shiloh.The mattress arrived two days later by UPS in a box that seemed way too small to possibly hold a king sized mattress. My wife wondered if we had been sent the twin mattress by mistake. The box clearly indicated that it had been packed in September and held a king sized mattress. The box compact but fairly heavy so we laid down some towels and dragged the box from the back door into the bedroom where we removed the box. The mattress is vacuumed packed in plastic, wrapped in a nylon sleeve like a sausage, wrapped in cardboard, and placed in the box. We carefully followed the instructions to cut open the plastic bag and slowly let the mattress unfold. At the factory, the mattress is first folded in half and then in thirds. Although some reviewers and the brochure indicated an initial odor, ours was odorless. As we cut the plastic bag away, I half expected the mattress to spring open like a life raft, but instead it was a slow and deliberate process (it probably took less than a minute to unfold the mattress). Then, as recommended, we left the crumpled mattress sitting on the floor to continue its 72 hour process to re-size itself.Although the brochure indicates you can sleep on the mattress during this 72 hour period, other reviewers had cautioned us to wait the full 72 hour period before using the mattress. It has been an unseasonable warm winter here in North Carolina, and the mattress arrived during a week with temperatures in the 70\'s. By evening (less that 12 hours after receiving the mattress), it was almost completely flat (just the 4 corners were still sticking up off the floor), so we decided to sleep on it. (By the next morning, the mattress was perfectly flat, but we continued not to put anything on it during the day for the full 72 hours just to make sure we did not impeded its process to return to its initial size).The mattress is 2 layers of foam in a zippered cover (which you are cautioned not to open or it will void the warranty). However, you can easily see that the base 7.5 inches is a high density foam that holds the shape of the bed. The top 2.5 inches are a memory foam that conforms to your body shape within a few minutes of getting into the bed. Though some reviewers said the mattress was too firm, I have always preferred firm to extra-firm mattresses and found the Shiloh to be perfect. Even my wife, who prefers a less firm mattress, says the Sleep Innovations Shiloh is not too firm. We bought the 12 inch mattress figuring we could add an additional memory foam topper from Sleep Innovations in the event we found the bed too firm. However, both my wife and I agree that the bed is not too firm and does not need an additional topper.A memory foam mattress is a different sleeping experience if you are used to a spring mattress. I\'d say it took us both about a week to get used to it, but we found mattress to be comfortable immediately the first night. It\'s hard to describe, but it is just different sleeping on foam. When you first sit on the bed or get in it, the bed feels really firm. But as your body warms up the top layer of memory foam, you slowly settle into the foam for a really comfortable night\'s sleep. The next morning, when you get out of bed, the foam slowly cools to room temperature and returns to it\'s original shape, with no permanent indentations.One of best things about the foam mattress is that you remain completely isolated from your partner rolling over, or in my case, restless twitching legs. On a spring mattress, your partner\'s every toss, turn and twitch is transmitted across the mattress. So if either one of you is a restless sleeper, the other one knows it. Not so on a memory foam mattress. All motions are absorbed by the foam. (There used to be a commercial on TV showing a glass of water sitting on a mattress (one foam and one spring) and a bowling ball was dropped on to the mattress. The glass of water on the spring mattress went flying, but the glass on the foam mattress was undisturbed. I never believed the commercial, but after sleeping for a week on the Sleep Innovations memory foam mattress, it is absolutely true!) My wife reports that she no longer feels my legs twitch at night, and I certainly can not feel her roll over at any point. Also, the thing about memory foam mattresses, you really don\'t roll around as much at night because there aren\'t the pressure points that exist with a spring mattress.As far as the heat issue; we have found none. Both my wife and I like to sleep cool and often run the ceiling fan at night during the summer, even with central a/c. Both of us have been perfectly comfortable temperature-wise during the past week with temperatures in the 70\'s.Overall, I would wholeheartedly recommend this mattress. And, it for some reason, you did find it too firm, I would think that a an additional memory foam topper would take care of it. However, my wife and I have both found the mattress to be super comfortable so far. I\'ll be updating this post periodically to give continuing feedback of our experience.***1 month update: After about two weeks, my wife decided that the mattress felt too hard - that she didn\'t sink into the mattress at all. We are both lightweight people and she was correct in her assessment, it felt as though we were laying on top of the mattress slab. Although, as my body warmed the top foam layer, it did somewhat conform to me, it was lacking a difficult to describe ""cozy"" feeling. Now perhaps if our weights were closer to the average American weight, we would sink into the foam more. But my wife came up with the perfect solution to give the mattress the missing level of coziness...she purchased as fiber-filled mattress topper from a local national retailer. We put the mattress topped between the mattress and the mattress cover. My wife now says she sleeps better than she has ever slept in her life!***2 month update: Still loving the mattress with the ""after-market"" mattress topper. We have had some warm days and cold nights this spring so far. I would say the mattress does not seem any hotter than a traditional spring mattress, however, we do have central air. I have noticed, however, that the Sleep Innovations foam is warmer on the cool evenings than the spring mattress. I notice it the most if I get up at night to use the restroom, when I get back in bed, the foam is still warm and pliable where I had been sleeping - whereas the old spring mattress would have returned to sub-zero freezing temperatures in the span of the 90 seconds I was in the bathroom.We both are loving the mattress and can\'t imagine ever going back to a spring mattress after this experience!', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States March 14, 2016', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars and then we have those purchases that we are happy about. However occasionally there are those rare times ...', 'author': 'Jonathan', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Let me begin by saying that this was a terrifying purchase. Buying a bed online without being able to try it first? Are you crazy?We all have those purchases we regret, and then we have those purchases that we are happy about. However occasionally there are those rare times when the decision to buy something is just a home run of a purchase.For me and my wife this was a grand slam of a purchase! We LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this bed!!!!My wife and I started shopping around for a new bed because it was just time. We liked the innerspring mattress we had (I can now say it\'s because we didn\'t know any better) but dreaded a new mattress purchase. Will I like it? Will she? I need something firmer, but she prefers a softer bed. Throw sleep numbers in there and I felt even more confused. We took a different approach to shopping this time and simply Googled the highest rated mattresses of any kind. That led us to this gem on Amazon. I can be a skeptic when it comes to purchasing anything. I have to research it to the best of my ability which aside from looking up the manufacture specific information about a product means that I also tackle actual customer reviews. I spent three days reading 100s of the 2000+ reviews on this bed to try to get a good idea of what people thought and what their experiences were with this bed. I consistently found that the detailed reviews that were of the higher rating often addressed sleeping habits/issues that I found I dealt with myself. In those reviews this bed usually solved those problems. The problems people generally listed in the lower rated reviews I found were issues I personally didn\'t have a problem with, or simply seemed inconsistent with more of the higher rated reviews. I also read a lot of the Q/As for this product as well as one of my concerns was what happens if I don\'t like it. I read enough to also be comfortable with the return process if I had needed it (which I absolutely don\'t!!). I can advise everyone to just read, read, and then read some more to help make your decision. Now these are all just things that helped me make the decision to buy the bed, so let me begin actually reviewing it.The bed came squeezed in a big box, but much smaller than you\'d think a bed would be able to fit in. Removing it from the packaging was easy and straight forward, though it\'s certainly not a light mattress (over 100lbs). I did have to have someone help me lift it onto the platform, though it wasn\'t bad at all. I could have done it myself if I really wanted to try, but I had the help. A tip, place it wrapped up onto the platform/support that you will be using before you let the bed expand. This made the process easy for me. The bed comes with instructions to follow to properly unpack it as well as pictures. Essentially it\'s folded up into a W shape and when you cut off the packaging it unfolds. For me I placed the wrapped up bed onto my frame with the middle of the W in the center of my frame, so standing at the foot of the bed and looking at my headboard, I was literally looking at a W shape. Regarding the frame, while I was reading reviews I had hoped someone would mention specifically what they were using with this mattress as I was coming from a conventional mattress that had a box spring that was a size smaller so I couldn\'t reuse the box spring. I had to find something to use with this King. Not to sound like an ad, but I ended up going with the Sleep Master Platform Metal Bed Frame/Mattress Foundation and it works perfectly with this mattress (that\'s a separate review). Cutting it free it just popped free and unfolded perfectly onto the platform. I will point out that it doesn\'t spring open like a bear trap. My wife was afraid to do this alone assuming this thing would knock her over but it was the exact opposite experience, nice and slow. Once unfolded, it was easy to take the plastic out from under the now open bed. Yes it\'s a heavy bed, but that weight is evenly distributed. It\'s not a problem to lift a corner to slide something under it or out from under it. When our new bedding came in my wife was able to put the bed skirt under the bed all by herself. It took about an hour for the bed to come to ""sleepable"" shape. The corners were still a bit rounded, but it was flat. I did not experience any issues with the seams where the mattress was folded. I do live in Arizona, so it\'s a warmer environment. I know the ambient temp affects this process, though it is winter for us now (though that\'s laughable to most people) it\'s not like it\'s blisteringly hot right now. I have the ambient temp of my house around 75ish degrees. The instructions say to give it a full 72 hours to retain its proper shape but I would say for me that took just over 24 hours. It\'s now cut completely square just like the photo. As far as sleeping on it, we did so the first night. You are allowed to sleep on this bed the day you receive it. The instructions with mine encouraged it to help with the shaping process. We had no issues with any odor from the bed. I have memory foam pillows that were far worse. This bed had a very minor odor if I put my nose directly to it and breathed deeply, otherwise I had no need to open a window or anything like that.First night\'s sleep was great, though now I can say it\'s much better after a few days use (as I write this I\'ve had it for about 3 weeks). I did notice that first night that the bed does sleep warmer than our innerspring did, however it was not a furnace. I did not find myself sweating like crazy, and I\'m a person that generally sleeps hot anyways. I like feeling the weight of a sheet on me but don\'t\' like to be hot. I actually attribute it more to the stuffiness of the room at the time, which does seem to affect the heat of the bed. I simply adjusted how I use a fan in the room the first few nights and was perfect. In the third week of use, I don\'t know if I\'m simply used to the bed now or what changed, but I don\'t feel that it sleeps warm at all anymore. My wife feels the same. Comfort wise it\'s amazing. I have never experienced such restful sleep. The bed seems so soft if you sit on it, but lay down and it\'s perfectly firm/soft as you need it and I\'m 220 lbs. My wife, who\'s preferred softer conventional mattresses in the past, adores this bed. As firm as it is, it still perfectly conforms to her as she needs it, and she is a petit 5\'4"" 120 lbs. She also had constant back pain prior to this bed. She sees a chiropractor and goes regularly to be maintained and originally attributed her issues it to her footwear or the nights she didn\'t sleep on her back. She hasn\'t had any back injuries or accidents to attribute to her back problems. She has woken up completely back pain free since sleeping on this bed, and she no longer concerns herself with sleeping on her back anymore as she prefers her side. Thank you Sleep Innovations for making her a happier person! The sad thing for me is that I caught a cold just a few days after we got this bed so I feel like I haven\'t been able to experience its full potential yet. Even with a cold though, I sleep better on it than I ever did on my old mattress. I was constantly tossing and turning before, and that just isn\'t the case anymore. Regarding rolling over/moving, we have had no issues adjusting our sleeping position on this bed. I\'ve never felt like I was stuck in a ditch, nor have I felt like I\'m waiting for the bed to respond if I do move. Yes you can tell it responds to you, but that takes 10 seconds at most. I don\'t roll back into the divot I left in the bed. There is no divot. Even sitting on the bed propped up on the headboard, this bed is so much more comfortable. I\'m a gamer, so I do sit on the bed a lot, and I can now sit comfortably in one spot without feeling my legs or bottom fall asleep.I can\'t wait to continue to experience this bed. We slept in a hotel recently and had the worst night\'s sleep ever. We couldn\'t wait to get back home to our new mattress. If I could rate this more than 5 stars I would. I will attempt to keep adding to this review as time goes on with my experience with this bed.Minor update: Not that this has anything to do with sleep quality, but for those with little kids who like jumping on your bed (thanks grandpa!), we have found that our children no longer like to jump on this bed at all. It just doesn\'t bouce like a traditional mattress. Another random plus for this mattress!! :)', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 13, 2014', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Never Will I Go Back to Springs', 'author': 'Chris', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'The background: My wife and I bought our first king size bed in April 2005. Three years later the thing was already sagging down the middle. We lived with it for a year and then finally made a warranty claim. The company stripped the bed down to the springs and rebuilt a new mattress. It lasted 8 months before terrible again.So I read Consumer Reports and lo and behold, besides the fact that it states that mattresses are the number one inquired about review next to cars, they don\'t actually rate any mattresses. I guess it is b/c the companies give each store their own model so it is impossible to compare. Consumer Reports did, however, give satisfaction survey numbers on the different manufacturers. It was amazing. All but one were 50% or lower (the question, I believe, was would you buy another mattress of this brand). Most were much lower than 50% (Serta was 35%). I mean WOW. It is disheartening to think that the vast majority of people are unhappy with their beds. And yes, this includes those Sleep Number, outrageously priced people (I can buy an inflatable queen mattress at Wal-Mart for $15. Why does putting a case around it make it worth $3,000?)Well, the ONE COMPANY that had higher than 50% was Tempur Pedic (around 60%, not great, but better than the rest). Problem is, even though I could afford it, there is no way I am paying $3,300 for a 12"" king size mattress. My first thought is, ""China makes everything for 1/100th of the cost"", so I started Googling memory foam mattresses. To my pleasant surprise the good ol\' USA came through with Sleep Innovations.I read all, and I mean all the reviews. I initially thought the Amazon Vine reviews (which are a lot) were bogus, purposely placed customer reviews. I have since learned (from a negative comment) that just means the company gave a bunch of free beds to get Amazon Vine reviews. But even discounting the Vines\' reviews, you could see that nearly all people were happy with it. I was still concerned though because I read horror stories from customer reviews on another off-brand memory mattress at Amazon. Stuff like the corners not ever flattening out and the company saying it could only be returned in the original box (which is absolutely impossible - the thing is vacuum sealed in there).So I called the company. I am expecting terrible service and it was the complete opposite. I got someone right away. A very nice, non-outsourced woman said that the company had been in business for 12 years; yes I could return the mattress within the 20 year warranty and no I would not have to use the same box (which when I asked that question, she stated flatly, ""that would be impossible"").The product: I took the dive and bought it. The real test is how it will feel in 5 years, but I can\'t fast forward five years to give you a final verdict. And to that end, I figured I could get six of these for the price of a Tempur Pedic. But I can say that two weeks into it and I love this bed. A couple bullet points:1. No problem with the hotness issue you read about, but it is not summer. I figure worst case scenario, I will add an egg crate on top to have some separation from my body and the foam mattress if I have a heat issue. I should note that we had an 80 degree day recently and I had no heat issues that night.UPDATE: Have had 99 degree weather days and no problems (of course we use the A/C (keep it on 78), but I thought I should add that).2. Foam smell went away. Again, if it hadn\'t, I would have bought an egg crate so my nose wasn\'t right on it.3. It is a firm mattress. You would never believe it if you sat on the side but when your whole body is stretched out, it is firm. It is a good firm though. I always thought I was a soft mattress guy, but after sleeping 4 years on a pillow top and a bad back to show it, I am making the switch. I figured if I needed it softer, I could buy an egg crate (see a pattern here?).4. DO NOT TAKE OFF THE WHITE COTTON COVER. This is apparently the equivalent of the do not remove for penalty of jail tag. If you read the brochure that comes with the mattress it tells you that the warranty is void if you do that. So put some other cover over that if you must.5. My wife has a memory foam pillow and it contours big time to your head and if you move your head, it is like you are squishing down Mount Everest again. This mattress is not like that. Very mild contouring which I think is a real plus.6. As other reviews say, it is heavy as Hades. I got it upstairs with me pushing it up with my back and my wife getting it over each stair hump. I would NOT recommend this if you have a bad back, etc. Get a couple guys to do it.Anyway it is late, I am tired, and I have a fantastic bed to go sleep in.UPDATE: Unfortunately, we have had numerous 100+ degree weather days here in Georgia. Fortunately, however, I have not had any problems with feeling hot because of the bed.UPDATE: Year later, no sagging, still very happy.UPDATE: Two years later, no sagging, still very happy.UPDATE: Three years later, no sagging, still very happy.UPDATE: Well after four years, we noticed the memory foam top 2.5 inches was much softer than when we bought it. I guess it is to be expected, but we want a very firm mattress. Best option is flipping over and putting your own new memory foam topper on. That will make this a 14"" tall mattress, which makes me think maybe it would have been better to start with the 10"" model.So I pulled the warranty card and got a new mattress. But I hesitate in saying anyone could do the same. According to the website, you have to have a 1.5"" permanent indention to meet warranty requirements (by way of contrast, the exorbitantly priced TempurPedic only requires a .75"" permanent indention). I mentioned to the customer service rep that I have loved the bed and in fact authored this review. I cannot say whether that made a difference which is why I hesitate in saying anyone could do the same.Note, however, that the couple I gave my 4 y/o bed to LOVES the bed and has no problem with it. As I said, I think it would be perfectly fine for anyone who does not want a firm top.UPDATE 5/17/18: Still love it!', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 26, 2011', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '2.0 out of 5 stars Mattress is hard & hot, buy with caution', 'author': 'Melissa Kirsch', 'rating': 2, 'content': 'I\'m not a big Amazon reviewer, but I spent so much time reading mattress reviews before I bought the Sleep Innovations 12"" Queen mattress that I felt I should contribute to the discussion as there seems to be a disproportionate number of wholly positive reviews on here. I am trying, hope against hope, to fall in love with this mattress, but it\'s hard. It\'s hard as in difficult and it\'s hard as in I have nicknamed the mattress ""The Marble Slab"" because this thing is more a morgue table than it is a bed.BackgroundI had the same, crapsterella, full-size, basic spring mattress from Serta for 16 years. That\'s way too long to keep a bed. I know this. I purchased a $200 mattress topper from Bed, Bath & Beyond in order to ""extend the life of it"" (really, it should have been put out of its misery a decade ago). The topper did make the bed heavenly soft, but I also found myself sleeping at the bottom of a crevasse and having to claw my way out--the topper had no support. I threw my back out after a lifetime of not a single backache (It can happen to you! Stretch! I\'m young and active and one day it just went and oh my goodness). Climbing out of the mattress topper was horrible for my back and I decided it was time to buy a new bed. Since I hadn\'t bought a bed since the Clinton administration, I was delighted to find bed technology had made some technological strides for the better. I had stayed at a friend\'s home for a month and never slept better; he informed me that his bed was ""one of those memory foam ones"" and I went on my quest. I went to a midtown NYC Sleepy\'s and risked catching a social disease lying on their filthy Tempurpedics and latex/foam combos and foam/spring melanges and determined that yes I loved the foam and no I could not pay $2000+ for a new mattress. I turned to Amazon and the overwhelming number of great reviews for Sleep Innovations finally got me (I also explored Bobopedic, Angel Beds, etc.). I had the thing delivered to my NYC apartment.As others have said a million times, the box is small, the thing weighs about 100 lbs., there is no way on earth you are going to get this upstairs if you are a weak-limbed girl with a back problem. My gym-buffed 6\'3"" friend pushed it up the one flight with difficulty. Unpacking it was a breeze, there was really no smell, I was psyched to have invested in perhaps the World\'s Most Praised Mattress. Onward to sleeping.PROSIf you\'ve been sleeping on a busted old mattress with a busted old boxspring and a ridiculous memory foam topper that only makes things worse, things are looking up when you first lie on the Sleep Innovations mattress. It\'s flat. It\'s firm.-You are not going to roll around a lot. Which is a good thing, because you do sleep more soundly. So soundly you are going to maybe wake up in a little pool of your own drool because you haven\'t moved a muscle.-It\'s firm. If you need back support, which I do, you aren\'t going to worry that you\'re sleeping on too soft a pillow-top or you\'re doing bad things for your spine. This thing is supportive.-It\'s high. I like a high bed. I have it on a boxspring (that weird one people say to get on here that you put together yourself is really a decent boxspring, I\'ve clearly been listening to Amazon reviews) and so it\'s about 20"" high from the ground with a bed frame. This is good for getting up with your bad back, as there are no springs to launch you out of bed.-You can sit on the edge and put your shoes on. I\'ve heard there are foam mattresses that have no edge support. With a mattress this hard, that\'s no problem.-There are occasional nights of good, maybe great, sleep. You will go to your brother\'s house and sleep on a normal mattress, one you have slept on for years and used to think was a little hard, and think ""This is too soft! Beds are not supposed to be this soft and springy, this is not good for my back."" You are probably right, but it\'s a matter of degrees.CONSOK, listen to me. I\'m a picky sleeper, but not that picky. As in I sleep well in most hotel beds that pride themselves on comfort (W, Westin, etc.). I like a firm bed. I also thought, before I got this mattress, that I slept cold.-Listen to the people who say this mattress is hard. They are not kidding. They may be a tiny chorus that you\'re ignoring, as I did, needing to believe that this mattress is amazing and those people were a freakish minority, since every other review says this mattress is just right. I\'ve given it time to get used to, and I am still kind of shocked each night at how hard this thing is. There is no burrowing down into your bed. There is no ""oh my god my bed is so comfortable and cozy"". There\'s a lot of ""what the hell, I might as well be sleeping on the wood floor"".-You won\'t toss and turn, it\'s true, but if you TRY to turn, good luck. You can\'t roll around on this mattress. If you need to roll over, you\'re going to have to push yourself up on your arm and physically flip yourself over. There\'s no give. There\'s no help from the mattress to roll over. If you like to turn to get to the cool side of the pillow, you\'re better off turning the pillow. Or getting over your need to get to the cool side, because there is no such thing as a cool side in this bed. Which brings me to...-I am not menopausal, but I believe I have now experienced the discomfiting experience of hot flashes, thanks to the blazing oven that is the Sleep Innovations mattress. Imagine a pizza stone in a wood-burning oven. You are the pizza. HOT! Hot bed! I turn the heat off and still roast away in this bed. I did research to find what on earth was going on since, as mentioned earlier, I tend to be cold when I sleep. I read that a wool mattress cover is going to turn down the heat on a hot foam mattress. Not true. It does give a scratchy, horsehair sort of feel to the bed, which is not pleasant, but it\'s not cooling it down. People say to get the memory foam topper, but I\'m a little wary of the Amazon reviewers on here now, because I feel they\'ve led me astray once before. Listen to me. This bed is warm. I\'m a normal person and I\'m sleeping in a drafty New York apartment in December with a summer quilt and it\'s too much blanket. Farewell, down duvet. I won\'t be needing you now that I\'ve got a flaming mattress. How can we sleep while our beds are burning indeed.I am really trying to fall in love with this mattress. I so want it to be everything amazing that everyone else says on here. Anyone who lies on my bed or sleeps in it is shocked at how hard it is. I\'ve heard a lot of ""I could never sleep on that"" and ""That is not comfortable"" and I feebly cry that it is great (the power of positive protesting!) and great for my back (less pain, but the bar was looow) and really quite a bargain (the price tag is amazing, I\'ll admit it, but there needs to be a happy medium).I had given the bed 3 stars, as I do sleep okay sometimes, but then changed it to two after I realized I don\'t have many good things to say about it.

First, as others have noted. it is HEAVY. Unless you are pretty burly, two people will be needed to get it onto a bed. Any tiny bit of odor was gone in a day or two. I actually think the protector I used was responsible for most of the odor I noted. While everyone has a different opinion about firmness, I would rate this as medium firm or perhaps closer to medium than to firm. I would not rate this as a true pillow top, but that is fine with me as it should be a bit cooler in the summer. In any case, having a fluffy top on top of a rock has never made much sense to me. The best part of this mattress in my opinion is the firmness towards the edge. I inched over towards the edge while laying down, and I found that the edge was neither harder than the rest (which I often find and hate) nor did it create a tendency to have me slide off onto the floor. This makes the whole bed usable. I was afraid that the manufacturers hype would not actually be true, but here I think it is. Not sure how they did it, but it seems to work very well. I also tried sitting on the edge, which worked OK, but I didn't buy a mattress to sit on in any case. After only a week of use I can't comment on how it will hold up over time, but it certainly looks to be well made. I much prefer this design with springs as well as foam as it makes it much easier to move around. An all foam mattress does not spring back fast enough to help me roll over, making it more work to move about. My only possible negative comment is that the springs are pretty much at the bottom of the mattress such that I expect that this mattress would not work well if it were only supported by slats rather than a box spring or other flat surface. If I was using slats I would put a sheet of plywood under the mattress and on top of the slats. So, in conclusion, I will not write some over-the-top comments about this being the best mattress ever made, rather I conclude that it is apparently well made, very comfortable for me, and has just the right amount of support all the way to the edge."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States November 23, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic quality for the price!', 'author': 'K.

With its comfy, plush feel, in a box arrival, and motion isolation, this is a worthy consideration. Here are some of the things I’ve learned while owning it and things to consider before buying.I. Quality – This mattress looks and feels like a higher quality mattress with a thick knitted fabric outside, supportive coils on the bottom and a super comfy multi-layer foam top for cushion. I’d put this one in the lower side of the upper tier of the quality scale for mattresses and guess it’ll survive many night of great sleep.II. Performance – This section is very subjective, as so many of us require different levels of softness and support to achieve a high rating. I found this mattress to be very comfortable and inviting. It’s on the softer side fulfilling its billing as plush versus a firmer option. I think this one would be ideal for someone who is looking for a very soft and comfy surface, like ou’d envision sleeping on a cloud. They did a really good job of combining multiple layers of different types of foams to provide a softness barrier between you and the supportive coils. It comes conveniently in a box that is semi-easy to move and get into the needed location, but a bit heavy as you can imagine at 92.6 pounds for the full size. Make sure you have it in the final destination room before cutting open the bag its sealed in. It’s also worth noting that the knitted cover over the mattress, seems very well done and should provide great protection over the years.Overall – This a very nice mattress that effectively combines quality, comfort, and firmness. It does a great job of keep my back from getting sore, while still providing a super comfortable place to sleep. I’ll be sure to update this review, if I ever start to have problems with it.You can trust that this review is simply my honest opinion that is attempting to provide you with helpful insight that I wish I had before I picked this product.

Well, for anyone who doesn't know, a twin mattress is about 39 inches wide, by 75 inches long. And a twin XL mattress is about 39 inches wide by 80 inches long. So the only difference really, is that a twin XL mattress is 5 inches longer than a regular twin mattress.Anyway, I don't have any complaints about this mattress so far. it's actually even a lot more comfortable than I expected it to be. It's also more on the plush side than on the firm side. So I would say that it is more for people who are of average weight or perhaps below average weight. I just say that because I am below average weight, and as a result almost every mattress that I try is like concrete.

It was a decent match, serving me well through countless nights. Yet, as the years passed, the spark began to fade, and I found myself longing for something more—something that could rekindle the joy of jumping into bed at the end of a long day. That's when I discovered the DIGLANT King Mattress, and let me tell you, it was love at first sleep.Why I'm Head Over Heels for My DIGLANT Mattress:The Perfect Balance of Firmness: I've danced on both sides of the mattress firmness spectrum, and finding the middle ground has always been a challenge. The DIGLANT mattress, with its medium plush feel, is like the Goldilocks of beds—not too firm, not too soft, just right. It cradles my body with just enough give to feel luxurious yet offers the support my back needs to wake up feeling refreshed and pain-free.Support Where It Counts: The difference maker for me has been the 7-zone individual pocket springs. This isn't your average spring system; it's tailored to provide targeted support across different areas of your body. The result? A more personalized sleep experience that adapts to my needs, whether I'm curled up in a fetal position or lying flat on my back, staring at the ceiling and pondering life's mysteries.Staying Cool Under the Covers: I used to be that person who'd flip the pillow in search of the cool side throughout the night. But with the DIGLANT mattress, those days are behind me. Its ability to regulate temperature and keep heat at bay has been a game-changer, especially during those warm summer nights when even a whisper of warmth can be the difference between sweet dreams and a night of tossing and turning.Seamless Transition from Box to Bed: The unboxing experience was surprisingly satisfying. Watching the mattress expand and take shape was like witnessing a caterpillar transform into a butterfly—effortless and beautiful. It reached its full size without any weird dips or bumps, a testament to the quality and care put into its design and packaging.Edge Support That Defies Gravity: As someone who often finds themselves perched on the edge of the bed, either reading a book or simply contemplating the day ahead, the edge support on this mattress is a revelation. Gone are the days of slowly sliding off the bed or feeling unsupported. The DIGLANT mattress holds firm, providing a stable and comfortable perch no matter where I find myself.The Verdict:Reflecting on my sleep journey, the transition to the DIGLANT King Mattress feels like moving from a cramped apartment into a spacious, luxurious home. Every night, I look forward to the embrace of my mattress, knowing it will provide the perfect blend of comfort, support, and coolness. The thoughtful design, from the targeted spring support to the temperature regulation and robust edge support, shows a deep understanding of what makes a good night's sleep truly great."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 7, 2024', 'is_verified': False}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Meets or exceeds expectations', 'author': 'Jeff & Wendy S', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Shopping for a mattress online is about the hardest thing you can shop for. I\'m a car-but who has spent less time researching a car than a mail-order mattress. Pick any mattress and the reviews will be all over the place... and you can\'t really return them if you don\'t like them (I\'m not sure what they do.)Disclaimer: possibly as someone who has spent more hours than I can count researching mattresses on Amazon I was offered this one at a substantial discount through the Vine reviewer\'s program... but while I *do* factor in cost/value in my reviews, I do NOT let the discount influence my reviews... but it does get me to try products I might not have otherwise tried.That said, I took a chance on a brand I\'d never heard of before and ordered this. It arrived via freight truck surprisingly quickly. My first impression was that I was shocked how heavy it was (130 pounds!). It\'s also very tall! So make sure your bed situation can handle a 14"" tall mattrees. This is neither a good or bad thing, but something you should be aware of. It took two of us to lift it onto the platform.It expanded very quickly, but I resisted the urge to evaluate it too quickly. I didn\'t even get on it for 24 hours, and didn\'t sleep on it until the third night. (Although I don\'t think you would do any harm by using it immediately. The instructions do say it could take 7 days (!) to fully expand. The truth is, it\'s going to expand 90% in the first few minutes, 95% in the first few hours, and then take a couple of days to finish taking the tiny bit of bagginess out of the sides.) One thing to note: before you remove even the outer plastic sleeve, make sure you\'ve placed the mattress where you want it. I very carefully cut away the two outer sleeves and found there was a very small hole (nowhere near where I was cutting - it wasn\'t me) in the vacuum wrap so it slowly started expanding immediately... then, once I intentionally cut the vacuum wrap, it expanded much more quickly.)But you don\'t care about all that... you want to know how it works.Very well! So far, I love it!We just moved across the country, leaving behind 3 mattresses that all worked well. We temporarily moved into a furnished rental that has a well-known second-tier brand (starts with a ""Z"") and a VERY expensive brand name Te---Pe---. THIS is my favorite of the 6 mattresses I\'ve used in the last 2 months (The ""Z"" brand is a close second - also very good). I\'ve not tested in temperature extremes, but it seems very neutral. Also, some people ask about ""chemical"" smell... this has pretty much none. There was a little when I first opened it up, but it was a light, pleasant odor, like new furniture, and nothing you\'d walk into the room and notice.The Amazon page says this is a ""plush"", but I think it was the label on the box that said it was a ""medium plush"". I think ""medium plush"" is the more accurate. I love soft beds, but I\'m always afraid that if it\'s *too* soft it could hurt my bad back or could feel constricting. Had I tried this mattress blindly, I would have guessed it was a medium, so my fear of it being ""too"" soft is not a concern. I think this is a bed that could satisfy anyone who didn\'t need the most extreme ends of the scale. Heck, I might even put a thin (1 - 1.5"") memory foam topper on it for added luxury, but it\'s pretty nice as-is, soft and conforming, yet supportive. I\'m not sure if it\'s my ""dream"" mattress, (I haven\'t found that yet) but it\'s excellent and also better (to me) than the multi-thousand mattresses I tried in the furniture store recently... the purple one was pretty nice, but I don\'t think I\'d ever pay that much.Well done.

The 5 layered memory foam feels good on the back and the rest of my body, it conforms really well to my back and for my wife\'s. It doesn\'t sink at all in the middle nor is it uneven in pressure (like the edges compared to the center). The comfort level extends to the cooling factor on it, for I was afraid that it was going to create a lot of heat for me. Well, it is very breathable and allows air flow to work well on my body.

Comfort is aided by softness and firmness all at the same time. Did I mention how nice looking it is too?My first guest was VERY comfortable and had a pleasant nights sleep. I will say that I was very apprehensive about getting a mattress in a box with my first one thinking how could it possibly be good….so I am very happy I took a chance. The others I have all standing up well and holding their quality. I expect nothing less with this one.

I'm using a low profile box spring and a bed frame. I previously had a mattress topper which I no longer use because it's not needed and adds too much height. This mattress is tall! I wanted something delivered because I don't have a truck. As delievered, this was easy to maneuver and expanded quickly. Ultimately I have been sleeping incredibly well with this mattress. I will update the review at the one year mark if there are any problems with its quality or longevity but so far I am really happy with it."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States March 1, 2024', 'is_verified': False}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Sleeping much better, now.', 'author': 'sal', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'This mattress was replacing an older memory foam mattress. My wife and i are very satisfied with this one. There is much more flex than our previous one, but that makes the new one feel much softer, and exactly what we needed. Took about 2 days to fully expand. There was absolutely no odor, which was a serious concern with this type of mattress. It was actually a few inches larger in each direction than our previous one, which is great because it fills in the frame better and no more lost pillows.

Nonetheless prior to this I had a 100% memory foam queen mattress and the same mattress protector in queen size. Sleep was not nearly as comfortable as it is now with this hybrid mattress. The memory foam we had just proved to be too soft and was bad for our aging backs. This mattress is perfect and I'm never again going back to queen size!!

I’m almost 50 and have been dealing with lower back pain for about 3 years after an injury that caused this back pain and sciatica. I also experience hip pain during my sleep. Because of all of this, my bruxism (teeth grinding and clenching) worsened.I’ve been using two gel infused mattresses toppers on a traditional spring mattress that was considered a good quality mattress, but wake up every morning with a stiff back, sore hips, sore jaw and exhaustion. I wake multiple times a night with something hurting and find it hard to get back to sleep. My body almost never feels rested.I started researching mattresses, in hopes of finding a solution. Found out that based on the way you sleep, certain mattresses are better or worse for you. After researching further, I also discovered all the toxins that are in mattresses. Unbelievable!I looked at around 40 mattresses and narrowed my search to a handful. This one was one of them. I wanted something with the certipure certification because these beds have way less toxins and I couldn’t afford one made with cotton, and animal fur. I didn’t want a hybrid because all of them collapsed too far around the edges when you sit on them. I also wanted a 14 -inch because I have a platform foundation, and I wanted a matress made for side sleepers. I rolled the dice on this one, which at the time has zero reviews. Really made me nervous, but I hoped for the best.This mattress arrived 3 days early. Delivery took almost a week so not bad. Super heavy but well packaged. I rolled it out and cut the vacuum sealed bag with the tool that came in the package. The mattress instantly started puffing out. It was recommended to let it rest for 72 hours but it was fully puffed all around within 24 hours. There was absolutely no odor at all during this process. I was sleeping on my couch and that was killing my back so I tried the mattress out, since it looked and felt perfectly fine. Let me tell you, this mattress is an absolute dream!! You can feel it form around the curvature of your body without collapsing too far in. Everything on your body’s stays aligned but cushioned so there are no pressure points. I’ve never felt anything like it. After just an hour of laying on my back just letting my body relax, I felt so much better. It was like pain was melting away.I slept like I’ve never slept before. No back or hip pain while sleeping at all. I don’t even remember walking up through the entire night. Even my legs, which I didn’t realize were also uncomfortable, felt so relaxed all night. I even slept with just one pillow. Usually I have two body pillows and a spare one to adjust areas around my body. I didn’t need any of them, but the one under my head.Also, my jaw wasn’t hurting after waking up! I must not have ground or clenched my teeth much in my sleep. One added bonuses was I was anticipating having some overheating issues because these materials usually sleep hot, but I had absolutely none. I mean wow, I feel like I hit the jackpot here. I woke up with more energy and my body feeling so much better.I highly recommend you getting this mattress if you are a side sleeper. Your hips and back and health will thank you every night. Can’t beat this price, for everything you get plus a washable cover. Such a great product! I’ll update in 6 or so months on the durability of this mattress.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States March 3, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing', 'author': 'Aliaka Dorsey', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'This is the most comfortable mattress I’ve ever had it shapes to your body.

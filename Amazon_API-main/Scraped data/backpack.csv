The 1st one was a while back mainly for work travel, and the 2nd just a few days ago because of the incredible price! The zippers are sturdy and do not get caught up in the material (the material is not cheapy) when opening, and closing. The USB charger connector (on the outside) is shrouded, and facing down so debris, or moisture doesn't get into it. Quite a few zippered pockets inside for whatever you need to carry. The shoulder straps are very comfortable, durable, and not overly padded (just right). Also the stretchy luggage slip-on on the back is definitely well done, it's a snug fit, not lose at all. That's a plus when hustling to your next flight. Depending on its contents it sits upright on its own. It's rare that I brag about something from Amazon, but this would be one of them. I should buy a few more for gifts. I'm sure this will last a long time, I take care of my stuff, but if you're rough, and tough then you'll be satisfied, and happy with this purchase.

It fits my laptop, binder, notebook and miscellaneous stuff with room for more.I like that the backpack is not too big but still holds a lot.

I purchased one for my personal laptop the next day. This backpack has so many features that you could use for anything you need to do. It’s a laptop backpack/case but it can do so much more for you. There are two external drink holders. A usb hub to hook up to a brick that lets you charge your phone, laptop, or anything else that needs to be charged. The compartments are numerous and well thought out by the engineers who designed this bag. Padded shoulder straps, an inaccessible pocket to prevent thievery while wearing, and multiple d-ring-like attachments to hang stuff from will make your life easier and more organized. There is also a strap across the back that you can place over your luggage extendable arms so you don’t need to carry it on your back. This backpack is top quality at a much cheaper price than a lot of the “regular”backpacks out there.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 27, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Almost perfect!', 'author': 'Zach S.', 'rating': 4, 'content': ""Almost perfect! When I flew on one of Spirit's new airplanes with hard back seats my old Swissgear backpack wouldn't fit, It was also getting long in the tooth being 6 years old at this point. So went down the rabbit hole and found this backpack. Happy I did.First, love the yellow color of this backpack! It's tied with my favorite color (navy blue) and was happy to find a backpack in this color. The layout is GREAT too. Holds so much stuff in it. I didn't realize it from the pictures that there's actually a front side pocket that holds a lot there in addition to the smaller front pocket. Only layout change I'd make was putting a pocket on the other side of the laptop compartment, seems like a waste of space there. Love the hooks on the straps. With my old backpack I had a Caribeener Clip on the front I used to keep a travel day pack on so when I walked it'd be on the back. I was always nervous about it falling off (did once) I was happy to see these hooks on the straps. I put 2 Caribeener Hooks on them, and walking in Philly with the travel bag in the front was so nice. Layout wise, this backpack gets a 4.5/5 rating from me. If they add that pocket, it'd get a 5/5 haha.Now the cons of this backpack. I like how the top 2 zippers have the lock spots on the zipper if you want that. Wished on the 3rd zipper had it too, as I'm sure people would like to secure stuff there also. One thing I did notice was the zippers and straps are def weaker then my old backpack. They're def way easier to open, doesn't feel as secure to my old one. The straps seem easier to come loose too, one did when I was on my flight back home and I went to grab it to put it on getting off. It's possible I loosened it during the flight, so not totally blaming the company there.The next con is quality control with this company. The first backpack I got the USB charging port was completely blocked off by plastic (as shown in one of the pics). Back it went for a replacement. The second one I got the port did work, but was def finicky plugging in the cable to it. There was a sale so back this went and got a third one, and finally this one was perfect. If they improve that, I'd bring up my rating to a 4.5/5 for this backpack. As it stands, still a 4/5.While traveling I put down this backpack kinda hard on hardwood floors. The next time I turned on my MacBook Air M1 (2020) I had a bleeding blob screen defect on my laptop. I don't think that would have happened with my old backpack. Opened it a couple days later, and the blob def changed and is now for the most part gone. But I don't trust the padding in this backpack anymore, so bought a shock absorbent sleeve to travel with using this new backpack.On my return flight home I flew in one of those hard back seats I was talking about earlier. Didn't even realize it at first, so I was super happy to see the new backpack fit no problem (as shown in one of the pics)! My old backpack wouldn't have haha. I'm curious with my new thicker shock absorbent sleeve will work, so I'll report back if it it doesn't.This backpack could easily be a 5/5 rating. If they make the improvements I suggested (stronger zippers, straps, another set of locks on the 3rd zipper, another pocket, more padding it'd get that rating. But because of where it stands now with their QC issues, I stand by my 4/5 rating. Def keeping this backpack for my travels though."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 22, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing Backpack, So Much Space!', 'author': 'Sophie', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'This is a fantastic backpack! I bought it to replace an Ogio I had for around 6 years, so I was nervous about this one at first. But I have to say, I think I like this one more than my old one. I love all the nice organizational pockets this has, and there\'s even a slot in the laptop compartment that fits my charger and brick! I have an Alienware m17, and it fits perfectly in the padded laptop pocket. The backpack is made of what feels like a very durable canvas like material. The zippers are smooth, which is good and bad, especially on the laptop part, which could flop open if you\'re not careful. The straps are comfy and the bonus ""secret"" pocket on the bottom of the bag is a nice bonus. In fact, there\'s a few hidden pockets on this thing!

(please read the review it will cover whatever is needed)', 'author': 'Miranda K. Greenlee', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""Originally got this backpack for my eldest son's senior year and used it on a daily now second semester of freshman in college still in amazing shape. there are multiple sections to the bag letting you divide your stuff easier. I put 4 stars for security because trying to unzip and take it would not be a hard task. A definite 5 starts for commuting because it has a very comfortable back and keeps stuff in place well. Lastly, the only reason I put 4 stars on traveling is because it's hard to store stuff since there are so many different slots most stuff doesn't fit but would be a great carry-on.

Everything is easily accessible and nicely organized. My MacBook Air literally lives in this bag and has never been scratched or damaged. Comfortable straps with no signs of tearing or separating at the shoulder. My last backpack had the strap start to fall off in a year which is why I bought this one.

A boy rough and tumble teenager carried it through Middle School with 20 pounds of weight and a stainless steel water bottle it survived three years of being tossed around. He refuses to have any other book bag I bought him a namebrand and he will not use it because of how many pockets and the secret pocket That’s in the back to protect his phone. So we recently upgraded by buying the same exact thing but it seems to be better than the one that we had he said the zippers are different longer whatever that maybe he is on the spectrum so he notices small differences. And he was willing to change colors instead of gray we got black. When the bag came in I was sick and he made his book bag switch over which is a really big deal that’s how much he wanted to use it the only problem we had with his old book back is he got the mesh part caught on something and ripped it where his stainless steel water bottle went and that hole grew bigger. It never completely bottomed out but I didn’t want my son walking around with a beat up book bag that was three years old as a freshman in high school after purchasing a namebrand he doesn’t care about brands I just wanted him to fit in. I wasted my money on name that namebrand did not have all the features this one did especially that pocket which now I believe every book bag should have because my daughter does not have one and we’ve had issues with phones being stolen at school. They cannot put it in the outer pockets somebody will steal it or steal something out of their bag so important things need to be put in that hidden pocket that is up against the users back. It holds my son‘s laptop/Chromebook and every there are no lockers so everything he has for school is in that bag. Considering the last one was still usable it still is it’s just I would prefer a nicer cleaner look the gray I could’ve cleaned it yes but the black looks sleeker and they have seemed to have made improvement or the black it’s just different than the gray I don’t know. I am just this is a 10 out of a 10 recommendation. When you’ve got very very picky children where you have to buy multiples of everything if they like something he wears the same pair of pants to school every day they don’t care that it’s the same pair so you buy multiples. So I’m going to probably buy more of these book bags to get him through high school college and he wants an emergency book bag. Bag. As a family emergency plan every human has a book bag/bag it’s tactical to carry lifesaving emergency items.And we’re ahead of the game because his old book bag is still usable besides one mesh pocket the newer version that I’m reviewing right now I will say the pocket seems to be deeper than mesh pocket that is on the side that his water bottle goes in it seems to be larger than the last one it’s the same water bottle that he’s had For two school years in a row and it fits much tighter snugger and deeper.I used to feel like his water bottle was going to fall out it never did but the way it looked it made me feel that way as a neurodivergent person I hope other neurodivergent person can appreciate this review and the type of detailing I’m giving. And I am happy to come back with a video comparing the two. We did go with the larger size I wasn’t sure what I ordered a couple years ago size wise. I went to my orders I clicked on the book bag and there is options and I’m like what size did I order took the measuring tape and it said it was at least 17 inches so I knew he needed the 17 inch one. at pictures when trying to purchase is confusing when you click sizes if you click on the 15 inch some of the pictures are still the same as the 17 inch. So that is difficult to understand we do have the 17 inch I recommend that over the 15 inch. Yes it does cost more money but you get so much more with the few extra dollars. The shoulder straps are comfortable. They have never broken. At one point when we first got his original bag the doctor had to write a note due to his traumatic brain injury he has some health or physical conditions with his lungs and his book bag could not weigh more than 17 pounds. He was starting to have a hunch back bad posture and pain . Because there are no more lockers that’s not a thing where we live. But since then he’s grown seven in the year of 2023. I still feel like he shouldn’t be caring 20 pounds but it is helping build strength and his posture is much better with this book bag keeping his shoulders back . I do these reviews because that’s how I purchase items how I make decisions are based on reviews. My son is almost the same height as me I’m 5 foot 11. He is high-level now so I would say he’s 59 to 510 he’s about 100 pounds This book bag suits him wonderfully it is a book bag that I will be purchasing for myself. I don’t know the specs in terms of waterproof or anything like that. He does like the ability to put a charger in it a power bank. Each pocket has a specific purpose. And it didn’t change too much The outside pockets that are exposed are still well placed and in a way hidden. Still not a place to put a phone. Phones his does not go in his pocket most children I know use them in their pockets. Their school allows them to have phones. My son feels that he could be pickpocketed . So that zipper is a game changer. I have seen dupes of this book bag and they do not have that zipper it looks like it in the picture but it’s a mesh airflow there is no zipper there do not fall for the dupes I almost dead I almost purchased the wrong bag that’s why I always go back to my original order to re-order from. I favorite things. Unfortunately sometimes those things are no longer there we got lucky with this book bag. Now we have a namebrand from when I was in school that sort of useless it does not have the features nowhere near the features this book has for computer/tablet or laptop. Don’t waste your money on Jan sports. But again my kid does not care about brands I order the same shoe and the next size and have been for years I ordered the same pants and a different size and he wears them every single day he has the same pair of pants. with a genius IQ 4.925 GPA going for engineering a believes this is the best book bag well-made book bag there is. I am not as smart as my child just super neurodivergent spicy uses talk to text this review is for other neurodivergent people. I know I make very long posts or reviews. Too much to read. Details matter. For the people that will not read it this review is not for them for the people that need to know little details this is for you. And I will be back with pictures and videos highlighting the features that we like the most. I mean the user of the book bag. I will be the one highlighting them as he does not consent to being on camera. I will do my best to reinterpret his explanations of the features.

I liked the OGIO but it was impractical with four divided sections making each section too tight for actual stuffing. I bought a larger 40L Matien travel bag and thought this would make a great daily commuting bag, but it looks like this bag is all that I need. This bag has 1 large pouch that has two mesh pouches inside and a battery bank pocket. That puts nothing in your way of actually carrying a ton of stuff. On the front is a gear pouch for stuffing all of your accessory cables and an organization pouch. The two side zip up pockets are a bonus with water bottle holders. The back pocket holds your laptop and files and the anti-theft pouch in the back with the luggage strap. Perfect for traveling. The handle is soft and cushy so we will see how it holds up over time. The bag stands up by itself without falling over. This thing is awesome!In the pictures there are 2 pairs of jeans, 4 underwear and socks, three shirts and a set of pajamas. 7 USBC cords, 4 port USB charger, 1 mac charger, and a SSD drive. One Emirates travel bag full of supplies. One battery power bank. One 15"" Macbook pro. One Boox Max3. The 2 side pockets are Empty.The one thing I didn\'t like was the power bank pouch. You can see in the picture that it has no elastic whereas the 40L does and just adds that smidge of reassurance that it\'s not going to be flopping around. Other than that I have no complaints about this bag.This is a TSA travel bag which means that the laptop part is supposed to open and you\'re supposed to sail through the checkpoint. I\'ve never experienced where this works, if you can tell me how to do this great, the agents always tell me to remove my laptops and place them in their own bin so to me this is a wasted feature. If you know how to do this in according to how it\'s supposed to work let me know.Update: 7.17Just returned from my trip to Tanzania and this bag was literally all I needed. I would only need something else if I was going to buy massive amounts of souvenirs. I even over packed by a pair of jeans and shirts.

With all this weight the handle is holding up well; don\'t yank lol but to just pick it up and walk, normal use it handles the weight do problems. Not stretching, the seems aren\'t stressed.My only wish......I would have liked to have seen more inside zipper pickets in all the main areas. It has the space for it and it would give the owner plenty of ways to stay organized and he/she can choose as to how full to pack it.

When I flew on one of Spirit's new airplanes with hard back seats my old Swissgear backpack wouldn't fit, It was also getting long in the tooth being 6 years old at this point. So went down the rabbit hole and found this backpack. Happy I did.First, love the yellow color of this backpack! It's tied with my favorite color (navy blue) and was happy to find a backpack in this color. The layout is GREAT too. Holds so much stuff in it. I didn't realize it from the pictures that there's actually a front side pocket that holds a lot there in addition to the smaller front pocket. Only layout change I'd make was putting a pocket on the other side of the laptop compartment, seems like a waste of space there. Love the hooks on the straps. With my old backpack I had a Caribeener Clip on the front I used to keep a travel day pack on so when I walked it'd be on the back. I was always nervous about it falling off (did once) I was happy to see these hooks on the straps. I put 2 Caribeener Hooks on them, and walking in Philly with the travel bag in the front was so nice. Layout wise, this backpack gets a 4.5/5 rating from me. If they add that pocket, it'd get a 5/5 haha.Now the cons of this backpack. I like how the top 2 zippers have the lock spots on the zipper if you want that. Wished on the 3rd zipper had it too, as I'm sure people would like to secure stuff there also. One thing I did notice was the zippers and straps are def weaker then my old backpack. They're def way easier to open, doesn't feel as secure to my old one. The straps seem easier to come loose too, one did when I was on my flight back home and I went to grab it to put it on getting off. It's possible I loosened it during the flight, so not totally blaming the company there.The next con is quality control with this company. The first backpack I got the USB charging port was completely blocked off by plastic (as shown in one of the pics). Back it went for a replacement. The second one I got the port did work, but was def finicky plugging in the cable to it. There was a sale so back this went and got a third one, and finally this one was perfect. If they improve that, I'd bring up my rating to a 4.5/5 for this backpack. As it stands, still a 4/5.While traveling I put down this backpack kinda hard on hardwood floors. The next time I turned on my MacBook Air M1 (2020) I had a bleeding blob screen defect on my laptop. I don't think that would have happened with my old backpack. Opened it a couple days later, and the blob def changed and is now for the most part gone. But I don't trust the padding in this backpack anymore, so bought a shock absorbent sleeve to travel with using this new backpack.On my return flight home I flew in one of those hard back seats I was talking about earlier. Didn't even realize it at first, so I was super happy to see the new backpack fit no problem (as shown in one of the pics)! My old backpack wouldn't have haha. I'm curious with my new thicker shock absorbent sleeve will work, so I'll report back if it it doesn't.This backpack could easily be a 5/5 rating. If they make the improvements I suggested (stronger zippers, straps, another set of locks on the 3rd zipper, another pocket, more padding it'd get that rating. But because of where it stands now with their QC issues, I stand by my 4/5 rating.

A boy rough and tumble teenager carried it through Middle School with 20 pounds of weight and a stainless steel water bottle it survived three years of being tossed around. He refuses to have any other book bag I bought him a namebrand and he will not use it because of how many pockets and the secret pocket That’s in the back to protect his phone. So we recently upgraded by buying the same exact thing but it seems to be better than the one that we had he said the zippers are different longer whatever that maybe he is on the spectrum so he notices small differences. And he was willing to change colors instead of gray we got black. When the bag came in I was sick and he made his book bag switch over which is a really big deal that’s how much he wanted to use it the only problem we had with his old book back is he got the mesh part caught on something and ripped it where his stainless steel water bottle went and that hole grew bigger. It never completely bottomed out but I didn’t want my son walking around with a beat up book bag that was three years old as a freshman in high school after purchasing a namebrand he doesn’t care about brands I just wanted him to fit in. I wasted my money on name that namebrand did not have all the features this one did especially that pocket which now I believe every book bag should have because my daughter does not have one and we’ve had issues with phones being stolen at school. They cannot put it in the outer pockets somebody will steal it or steal something out of their bag so important things need to be put in that hidden pocket that is up against the users back. It holds my son‘s laptop/Chromebook and every there are no lockers so everything he has for school is in that bag. Considering the last one was still usable it still is it’s just I would prefer a nicer cleaner look the gray I could’ve cleaned it yes but the black looks sleeker and they have seemed to have made improvement or the black it’s just different than the gray I don’t know. I am just this is a 10 out of a 10 recommendation. When you’ve got very very picky children where you have to buy multiples of everything if they like something he wears the same pair of pants to school every day they don’t care that it’s the same pair so you buy multiples. So I’m going to probably buy more of these book bags to get him through high school college and he wants an emergency book bag. Bag. As a family emergency plan every human has a book bag/bag it’s tactical to carry lifesaving emergency items.And we’re ahead of the game because his old book bag is still usable besides one mesh pocket the newer version that I’m reviewing right now I will say the pocket seems to be deeper than mesh pocket that is on the side that his water bottle goes in it seems to be larger than the last one it’s the same water bottle that he’s had For two school years in a row and it fits much tighter snugger and deeper.I used to feel like his water bottle was going to fall out it never did but the way it looked it made me feel that way as a neurodivergent person I hope other neurodivergent person can appreciate this review and the type of detailing I’m giving. And I am happy to come back with a video comparing the two. We did go with the larger size I wasn’t sure what I ordered a couple years ago size wise. I went to my orders I clicked on the book bag and there is options and I’m like what size did I order took the measuring tape and it said it was at least 17 inches so I knew he needed the 17 inch one. at pictures when trying to purchase is confusing when you click sizes if you click on the 15 inch some of the pictures are still the same as the 17 inch. So that is difficult to understand we do have the 17 inch I recommend that over the 15 inch. Yes it does cost more money but you get so much more with the few extra dollars. The shoulder straps are comfortable. They have never broken. At one point when we first got his original bag the doctor had to write a note due to his traumatic brain injury he has some health or physical conditions with his lungs and his book bag could not weigh more than 17 pounds. He was starting to have a hunch back bad posture and pain . Because there are no more lockers that’s not a thing where we live. But since then he’s grown seven in the year of 2023. I still feel like he shouldn’t be caring 20 pounds but it is helping build strength and his posture is much better with this book bag keeping his shoulders back . I do these reviews because that’s how I purchase items how I make decisions are based on reviews. My son is almost the same height as me I’m 5 foot 11. He is high-level now so I would say he’s 59 to 510 he’s about 100 pounds This book bag suits him wonderfully it is a book bag that I will be purchasing for myself. I don’t know the specs in terms of waterproof or anything like that. He does like the ability to put a charger in it a power bank. Each pocket has a specific purpose. And it didn’t change too much The outside pockets that are exposed are still well placed and in a way hidden. Still not a place to put a phone. Phones his does not go in his pocket most children I know use them in their pockets. Their school allows them to have phones. My son feels that he could be pickpocketed . So that zipper is a game changer. I have seen dupes of this book bag and they do not have that zipper it looks like it in the picture but it’s a mesh airflow there is no zipper there do not fall for the dupes I almost dead I almost purchased the wrong bag that’s why I always go back to my original order to re-order from. I favorite things. Unfortunately sometimes those things are no longer there we got lucky with this book bag. Now we have a namebrand from when I was in school that sort of useless it does not have the features nowhere near the features this book has for computer/tablet or laptop. Don’t waste your money on Jan sports. But again my kid does not care about brands I order the same shoe and the next size and have been for years I ordered the same pants and a different size and he wears them every single day he has the same pair of pants. with a genius IQ 4.925 GPA going for engineering a believes this is the best book bag well-made book bag there is.

The first time I ordered it, the zippers immediately broke so I was sent a replacement, but I haven\'t had any issues since. The zippers, mesh, pockets, etc. all are running very smoothly, even though I\'m a chronic over-stuffer.In the beginning of 2019, I packed this backpack and took it to Europe for about three months. It was my only luggage as I traveled cross-country via bus and plane, hostels and hotel rooms. Conclusion? This thing is HEFTY and can fit a lot of stuff.Over the years, I\'ve used it as my carry-on luggage for what amounts to maybe 30-40 trips now, and I also use it for short local weeklong trips, too. When it\'s overstuffed, it\'s too big to fit below the seat, so I mostly used it as an upper bin bag. It\'s slammed along the bottom of over a dozen bus carriages, trekked through wet, humid, and dry conditions, and it still looks great. I\'d say it\'s even stretched out a few inches over the years.Here are a few things you should know:- I wore this as I walked the misty, rainy streets of Edinburgh and the clothes inside remained dry.- I\'ve had to run to catch planes in-between quick layovers, sweating as I raced to catch my plane, and the straps have excellent wicking capabilities, because it\'s never smelled.There is a clamshell backing compartment that opens completely flat which is great for electronics. For me, it fits all of this:-12.5"" Dell laptop-11"" MacBook with padded holder-A paperback book or 1-2 magazines- 8"" tablet readerI can also sometimes cram my laptop fan, but sometimes not, if I pack too many clothes.That compartment is about 2.5"" W x 17""H closed. Frankly, it doesn\'t have a lot of give, so I try not to add additional items to that side.-There are two pockets in the side that have zippers, usually I add water bottles here, but you could also add shoes or dirty socks inside the zippered areas.-The largest compartment measures around 6.5"" W x 16"" H, though it has stretched out over the years.Here\'s a sample of clothes I can pack here when rolled them; rolled and wrapped a measuring tape around each piece of clothing to get the diameter, then measured the height (before I squish it all together):-1 pair of sweat pants 10"" x 4""-1 sweater 9"" x 3.5""-2 pairs of pants, one at 11"" x 4"" and 10"" x 3.5""-1 sweater dress at 10"" x 6""-1 pair of tights at 5"" x 3""-1 sweater at 11"" x 6""Then a packing cube with various undergarments (3 pairs of socks, 3 pairs of underwear) and two long-sleeved shirts at 11"" x 4.5""-And that leaves an empty space for more at 7"" x 5"" I put a few pairs of socks and a Google Nest in, but it\'s still not packed snuggly.-Then there\'s an additional flap, where I usually add a small toiletry bag with soap, shampoo, toothbrush/toothpaste, etc.-There\'s another small clamshell pocket where you can put pens, and there\'s a key ring so your keys don\'t get lost inside your bag.-There\'s an additional zippered pocket where I put my passport and extra TSA locks.There are straps on each side that I\'ve pre-measured out so that if I want, I can fit the bag under a domestic airline seat. With all of the above mentioned, there\'s room to spare for a few more things.Instead of adding toiletries to the end pockets, they would fit at the top of the pack and make it nice and snug. Enough clothes for 3-7 days, easily, depending on what you pack.-And to the handle, I\'ll usually wrap a scarf and neck pillow, or a jacket for the flight.And here are your caveats:-The more you pack those two deep pockets (clothes and electronics), the less space you\'ll have to pack anything else in the extra pockets.-If packing for underneath a seat, you can\'t have much in any of the other pockets or side mesh holders.-The bag is designed so you have to put some things in each of the two large compartments, you can\'t just fill up the larger one with clothes. It will gap and you\'ll find you\'re wasting space.-The straps are very thick and not particularly comfortable, especially when the bag is full, for a smaller frame like mine (5\'3"").Recently, I\'m entertaining the idea of switching out this backpack because of my own back lol. I need to downgrade to a rolling checked bag and get a smaller, lightweight backpack for my electronics since I WFH now and need to bring a bit more gear than I used to. But I continue to take this pack when I\'m spending the night somewhere for a few days, and I would definitely consider taking it on a short trip if I didn\'t need to bring my work equipment.Maybe I\'ll come back in a couple of years and let you know how I\'m using it at that time!', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 23, 2021', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Large Durable Backpack', 'author': 'Bubba Kahana', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'This backpack is oversized and durable.

Has pass-through slots for cables from your battery to your device. Decent enough padding for your electronics. Multiple pockets of varying sizes for different needs. Bottle holders work great & have straps to clip taller bottles in. Side straps can be used to buckle in hoodies or jackets/wind breakers. carry handle is very stiff & solid - hung loaded bag from it on a hook with no issues.Con\'s: TOO many pockets - easy to lose track of WHERE you put stuff! Lots of zippers - would be nice if they were colored (the black zippers blend in w the black backpack making it hard to find in low light). The 2 vertical pockets on either side near the bottle holders are narrow - if you have large hands, it\'s hard to get down to the bottom for small items. Would be really nice if it had a chest strap to connect the 2 shoulder harnesses - have that on my old backpack & really like that feature, especially for heavier loads.

I bought it bc I am not capable of packing lightly and wanted a big backpack w many pockets that I can shove full as a carry on- and it works perfectly for that.However I decided to write this review bc I recently moved to Bergen Norway. It rains every single day. This has also become my university backpack, although it’s a bit big to just carry my laptop and water bottle and snacks.. but I don’t have another one. Anyway, it holds up so well in the rain. Granted I haven’t had it long, but my laptops and books and everything else stay dry inside even when the rain soaks through my jacket and sweater..There’s no signs of wear yet and I’ve used it daily for months. When I shove it full for travel, I REALLY shove it full, and no signs of wear from that either. When it’s only carrying a few things, I like that I can cinch it up with side straps / clips so the empty pockets don’t gape out and it makes the whole thing slimmer.Overall I’m very impressed w the quality considering it’s from Amazon and not some name brand, which would be much more expensive.

I have back problems but even with all these things packed in with how it distributes the weight with the different sized pockets and the great shoulder straps, I had very little issues carrying this thing.

I used to use a Nordace backpack that was supposed to have 2 laptop pockets, but one of them was very much not meant for laptops, and was disappointed so I looked elsewhere. I am so glad I found this one. It is far more lightweight than my Nordace one, plenty of pockets and zippers for organization, inner pockets and a back pocket for security (I personally keep my wallet in an inner zipper pocket since the back pocket is a wee bit small). It also looks exactly like the picture (which is very exciting to me). Here\'s a bit of a breakdown:Pros: - Large laptop pocket (fits my 16"" laptop) - Lots of pockets - Against-the-back security pocket - Very breathable - Very light - Feels high quality and durable - 3 bottle-holder pockets (2 outside, 1 inside) - USB charging for portable batteries - Strap for attaching to luggage - WaterproofCons: - Likely won\'t hold larger items like textbooks (at least, it doesn\'t hold my large ones) - Security pocket is small - Doesn\'t have 2 laptop pockets - VERY tight outer bottle holder pocketsI, personally, got this for both work and school so I can carry both laptops together. It doesn\'t have 2 laptop pockets, but the one that it does is MASSIVE. The strap is actually loose even after putting both laptops into it so it can easily fit larger laptops. I went on a work trip and it was perfect. Half the time, I forget how much stuff I have in my backpack because of how light it is and how well it disperses the weight. I also appreciate that it\'s slim. My previous backpacks have always been bulky and I always felt awkward while trying to squeeze down the aisles of a plane to get to my seat, but it wasn\'t a problem this time. I do wish the outer bottle holder pockets were a little looser and larger so that I can fit my larger water bottle into them, but it isn\'t too big of a deal for me since I like to carry my bottle for the most part.Overall, this backpack is AMAZING for the price that it\'s set at and I hope more people find this. This has honestly been life-changing after having so many poor backpacks. My back thanks you for your product, Volher.

That is mine..... I like all the comforts of home with me during the day.I was looking for something compactful without looking like I was going trekking for 5 days.The material is sturdy. Exactly what I'd expect from such a pack.The Zippers to the two main compartments may not hold up well over time if you like to over stuff your pack.I've noted it and will be careful with them and try not to over pack the bag.My main disappointment is with the length of the shoulder straps and the waist strap.I am a big barrel chested guy. The shoulder straps are a struggle to get over my shoulders.If I have to wear an overcoat in really cold weather, the bag won't fit over my shoulders.Likewise, the waist straps won't fit around my size 48 belly....I will have to find some extenders to attach to the straps to make use of the straps on this bag.Once I am at work, I don't have to wear the bag.I can set it down on my workspace and have it handy when I need it.But I still need to carry a second but smaller ditty bagMy reason for the 3 stars for comfort are due to the shorted length of the straps.This was my only disappointment.Finally, I was attracted to the price of this item and thought to give it a try.Maybe I was a bit harsh in my review for such an inexpensive item, but as a recreational bag, this bag is better than okay. If you need to pack for a light weighted walk in the woods, this bag will accommodate you nicely.____________________________________________________Updated Review: Feb 29th.One week into using this bag, the only thing I find a problem for me is the length of the shoulder straps and thw waist belt. I am a bulky guy and the strap lengths are much too short for comfort. I am choking from the combined weight and shortness of the shoulder straps and the chest straps, forget about them. No use to me.The waist belt causes the bag to hang on me causing me more choking.Finding strap accessories wasn't easy at first.I searched YouTube and got lucky finding a solution for the shoulder straps buying a kit from Liberty Mountain Products; they sell lots of climbing gear.Then I searched Amazon for Liberty Mountain and found plenty of strap accessories.Now I have a complete solution for the shortness of shoulder and waist straps.Why put out a product with these kinds of issues in the first place ?At least produce some accessory straps to buy...Why make me search for a solution.I have plenty of other things on my mind....But now I have a pack that will serve me well for my limited needs from this pack.As a piece of luggage for everyday use or a gentle day walk in the woods... this pack is fine.Were in my 20's again winter camping in extreme conditions..... nope... I would not bet my life on a $35 bag.___________________________________________________________It's now September and I am still using this molle bag.By now I have tricked out the bag with accessory pouches and storage attachments.I am reasonably satisfied with this pack after having tricked it out with useful attachments.If I were to buy this system all over again, and I might for my motorcycle riding, a pack with a more supportive waist belt would be a priority for me. The entire weight of this pack fully loaded hangs on your shoulders instead of the weight being distribution around your waist allowing your chest to expand and breathe with you._______________________Sept 12th, 2020I only carry this bag from my car to my building to my work vehicle.I've got it tricked out with extra attachments to separate out my gear and lunch for easy access.I always pack more than what I need for the day, but during the week, I will access all compartments.Because I need to carry this bag short distances, it works for this purpose.And once inside my work vehicle, this bag is perfect; it suits the purpose for my 8 hour shift. (or double shift)If I were doing overnight in the woods on the ground camping, this bag is NOT for that purpose.You would be better off with a bag with a waist belt that centers the load over your hips and OFF your shoulders.At minimum, a rucksack with a decent hip padded waist belt.This bag is okay for lightweight day hiking;But I'd still opt for a bag with a padded waist belt that can center your load over your hips."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 22, 2020', 'is_verified': True}]"

And I think this + a Fanny pack or size bag is ideal for any weekend / short trip.And I fit things like makeup, medicine, extra tote bags, an extra outfit, protein bars & a wig for a themed night in this puppy.Only thing is the shoe bag takes up precious space in the middle so it’s not the ideal to really fit a pair of shoes in here if you plan on using this as your only bag while tracking for a few days. I wish there was an option for the shoe bag to like hang out the bottom since some airlines have a little wiggle room when it comes to the length of this bag.If you are between the standard size and the slightly larger one… I would go with the standard one if you want a personal item that can be used on most airlines.The only thing is just make sure you have big pockets if you plan of using the two front pockets, since I had to empty mine most of the way to fit the bag size restrictions. It just try not to use the front pockets at all/sparingly. By front pockets I mean the vertical zipper on the top front of the backpack & the pouch on the bottom front of the backpack.As for comfort, it felt fine carrying this around. The little chest belt in the front actually can make a big difference in comfort as well!!When it comes to sturdiness, this bag was packed beyond the brim and help up. Seams appeared to be on the verge of popping but it held itself together gracefully. (This is bc I packed too many clothes lol).All the compartments were fabulous!! And the padding in the laptop sleeve is better then most cases so you can save space by just putting your laptop in there with out additional protection.It would be 6/5 stars if the bag had a water bottle sleeve on the side. But the bag is truly perfect for maximizing the space of your personal item.Overall it’s a must have for airline travel :)Disclaimer 1: I did have the straps and everything fit in flight on frontier, I just forgot to take the photo after I did that.Disclaimer 2: I have photos of it fitting both horizontally and vertically in the frontier flight under the seat. Tbh is recommend putting the bag vertically so you can slip your foot in for more leg room… but to each their ownDisclaimer 3: When I flew frontier (leaving the Miami airport) I was told at the self check in screen to speak to somebody since I did not purchase a bag… but I simply just used the digital boarding pass on my phone with out speaking to somebody & I had no issues with any personnel. So on frontier the people working had no issue or raised any questions using this bag as my personal item, however the system was trying to prompt me to buy a carry on item or check bag.P.S. for frequent sprit flyers the larger size of this bag may work since there is extra space in the length restrictions in that airline :)', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States March 7, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars I love this bag', 'author': 'Avery Malone', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'It cones folded so it takes a little while to get it to keep its shape buf other than that a lovely product.

Many of the pockets were hidden which is great for theft prevention.My one complaint, or rather suggested improvements to this backpack are:1. the size of the non-laptop and laptop compartments need to be reversed. The laptop compartment is about 5 inches wide. The non laptop pocket is envelope width. That is a pocket where I would typically put a sweater, or a book, or purse type items. I ended up putting those items in the same pocket as my laptop. Not many things you can put in an envelope width pocket.2. I wish it had a couple of key leashes. There were none.3.

Travel wise....', 'author': 'Natayla', 'rating': 4, 'content': ""I bring my laptop, books, folders, iPad, etc. to school every day and spend most of my time on campus to finish homework or study before going home. My previous backpack gave me back pain because it was small, so this was a game changer. There are multiple pockets, enough room for extra items, and amazing padding on the back. The design is trendy and I bought the 17.3 inch BEIGE backpack during a sale.Is it waterproof? Yes! I walked through campus without an umbrella (didn't check the weather app) and none of my papers or electronics had a drop of waterIs it great for travel? Depends. The pockets allow you to store more items. However, I'd recommend buying a tiny lock if you're going to places with high stealing activity. The zippers are nice and smooth so it'll be easy to access your items within 5 seconds. This also means going through security checkpoints will be a breeze with how fluid the zipper is. If you're worried about someone having access to your items in crowded places, then I recommend looking for products with discreet zippers.If you're planning to use this to travel and will be bringing this everywhere when you're walking, I'd recommend finding ways to protect your items via locks or only using one compartment.Again, I mainly use this as a college student on a campus with not so much crime rate (that I know of). It's wonderful with its many compartments. My back doesn't hurt anymore and I can even fit my lunchbag in it. This also works for students in other grades (elementary, middle, or high school) with many textbooks or notebooks. Keep in mind the different sizes. It's not necessarily a rule but I think about how the backpack would look on my size. For example, you wouldn't buy the 18-inch backpack for a 1st-grade student."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 9, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great travel backpack', 'author': 'RM', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""This is a classy backpack that can replace your old briefcase.

I love that it has 6 pockets. And I love the water bottle holder on the outside. And I love how it attaches to a suitcase handle (sits on my carryon). It is very light when empty and will hold a lot. The zippers also seem to be good quality. And my 16"" macbook pro fits well.However, I\'m not sure how long it\'s going to last. The inside liner material is so thin it\'s like tissue paper. It offers almost no protection for a laptop because there is very little padding. If you have something soft in the same section as a computer it\'d probably be ok. I was a little nervous when my backpack fell at the airport but nothing was broken.I hope it lasts because it\'s great for travel and I really like it. I just wish the inside was of higher quality like the Jansport pack it replaced. The Jansport is almost 20 years old and still going strong (the blue color faded into purple so it\'s not my favorite no more).Update: Just completed a trip to Paris with this backpack. I had two 16"" macbook pro\'s in it, and I still had a ton of room for my other stuff. I had it so full it wouldn\'t fit under the seat in front me easily due to the budget airline\'s limited space. I like how it has so many pockets, I was well organized. My money and documents is in one of the pockets so I don\'t worry about money falling out while I\'m getting food or headphones. The strap that allows placing on a carryon wheeled baggage is super useful. Overall I\'m really impressed.

The water does bead-up when it gets on the fabric and you can simply shake it off once you're indoors. It's kept my MacBook and other paper documents dry on rainy days. I think the fabric can also be treated with waterproof sprays (that you would use for technical waterproof jackets) to retain its water repellency.I also love how there are adjustable straps to adjust the thickness of the backpack, which is great for packed trains/buses. There's also a velcro strap in the main compartment to adjust the fit for your laptop as well. I keep my 13 in. MacBook in a case and even with the case, it fits snugly with room to expand if-need-be. 15 in. laptops should fit with no problems, even with its own cases as well.The charging port works great as well. There's an inner pocket as well as a zippered pocket designed near the cable port/outlet that's inside the main compartment which can hold your power bank and any cables you might have, so it won't get tangled up with the other stuff you have in the backpack.The side pocket is also big enough to hold a water bottle snugly and can expand to hold tumblers as well.The second main compartment is a great stationary organizer, with multiple pockets and pen holders.I bought this color in black and it came as more of a dark, dark, heather-gray black, as some of the other reviews mentioned. This actually looks better in my opinion as it doesn't contrast with the zippers as much and gives it a more distinguished high-quality look.The bookback is also very comfortable with a padded back and padded shoulder straps.

I also had one for general university things like books, laptop, and miscellaneous items.Pros:- it fits a lot of things in it. I’ve managed to fit 3 packs of caprisun, 2 big bottles of lemonade, plates, silverware, and napkins into this thing, on top of very normal small things to have in a bag. It can handle very large loads.- A lot of pockets. GREAT for organizing.- Spilled some shampoo in it before, and it didn’t leak into the other pockets. Though, I would imagine the pockets would not guard against something like water.- speaking of water, the inside stays pretty dry when it rains, but if it pours then it gets a little damp, but not bad.Cons:- quality. The first bag I ordered had the rubber handle at the top of the bag tear. I don’t even know how this could happen. Besides this, it’s held up well.- Zippers zip wayyyy far down. When I first started using this bag, I had to be very careful and conscious of how I zipped the bag closed, because the zippers go all the way down to the bottom of the bag. So, one time I zipped it closed pretty normally, but as I was walking to class it slowly zipped itself open, because the weight of the bag was pulling on itself, unzipping the bag. This almost costed me a lot of money. Thankfully someone noticed before my laptop fell and shattered on the pavement. The bag has clips on the side as a safeguard from this happening, though it’s not perfect. You have to make sure both zippers are at the very top middle of the bag. This design might be intentional, but it’s still something that I don’t like.- The very back pocket, where the laptop goes, has several smaller pockets inside it. If you’re in a rush, you’ll stuff your laptop against the elastic and it won’t go in- it will bounce back up like a trampoline. Why is there a pocket there? Why is it so far down? Who actually uses this?? I just have stuff that gets stuck in there…- the zipper lock just isn’t … feasible. You can only lock one pocket, but even if you do, there is nothing stopping a thief from slashing your bag open with a pocket knife. I get that it’s an extra safeguard, but college students do not have the time to lock and unlock their BACKPACKS with a pin.

I later took it to the UK for two weeks and it again proved to be the best travel backpack I've ever used. Plenty of room for my iPad, a full change of clothes, jackets, snacks and room to spare. It's surprising how much expansion this backpack has. The stitching is strong, the material is thick and hardy. Not thin and easy to rip like the vinyl ones. There's plenty of pockets and chambers for all your needs. It even has a charging port. This does make it a little heavier but not enough to justify using the cheaper made packs. I liked it so much, I ordered two more for family members for our next trip this coming year. If you travel or if you need need a good, sturdy, everyday backpack for work or school, this is it.

The USB charger connector (on the outside) is shrouded, and facing down so debris, or moisture doesn't get into it. Quite a few zippered pockets inside for whatever you need to carry. The shoulder straps are very comfortable, durable, and not overly padded (just right). Also the stretchy luggage slip-on on the back is definitely well done, it's a snug fit, not lose at all. That's a plus when hustling to your next flight. Depending on its contents it sits upright on its own. It's rare that I brag about something from Amazon, but this would be one of them.

When I flew on one of Spirit's new airplanes with hard back seats my old Swissgear backpack wouldn't fit, It was also getting long in the tooth being 6 years old at this point. So went down the rabbit hole and found this backpack. Happy I did.First, love the yellow color of this backpack! It's tied with my favorite color (navy blue) and was happy to find a backpack in this color. The layout is GREAT too. Holds so much stuff in it. I didn't realize it from the pictures that there's actually a front side pocket that holds a lot there in addition to the smaller front pocket. Only layout change I'd make was putting a pocket on the other side of the laptop compartment, seems like a waste of space there. Love the hooks on the straps. With my old backpack I had a Caribeener Clip on the front I used to keep a travel day pack on so when I walked it'd be on the back. I was always nervous about it falling off (did once) I was happy to see these hooks on the straps. I put 2 Caribeener Hooks on them, and walking in Philly with the travel bag in the front was so nice. Layout wise, this backpack gets a 4.5/5 rating from me. If they add that pocket, it'd get a 5/5 haha.Now the cons of this backpack. I like how the top 2 zippers have the lock spots on the zipper if you want that. Wished on the 3rd zipper had it too, as I'm sure people would like to secure stuff there also. One thing I did notice was the zippers and straps are def weaker then my old backpack. They're def way easier to open, doesn't feel as secure to my old one. The straps seem easier to come loose too, one did when I was on my flight back home and I went to grab it to put it on getting off. It's possible I loosened it during the flight, so not totally blaming the company there.The next con is quality control with this company. The first backpack I got the USB charging port was completely blocked off by plastic (as shown in one of the pics). Back it went for a replacement. The second one I got the port did work, but was def finicky plugging in the cable to it. There was a sale so back this went and got a third one, and finally this one was perfect. If they improve that, I'd bring up my rating to a 4.5/5 for this backpack. As it stands, still a 4/5.While traveling I put down this backpack kinda hard on hardwood floors. The next time I turned on my MacBook Air M1 (2020) I had a bleeding blob screen defect on my laptop. I don't think that would have happened with my old backpack. Opened it a couple days later, and the blob def changed and is now for the most part gone. But I don't trust the padding in this backpack anymore, so bought a shock absorbent sleeve to travel with using this new backpack.On my return flight home I flew in one of those hard back seats I was talking about earlier. Didn't even realize it at first, so I was super happy to see the new backpack fit no problem (as shown in one of the pics)! My old backpack wouldn't have haha. I'm curious with my new thicker shock absorbent sleeve will work, so I'll report back if it it doesn't.This backpack could easily be a 5/5 rating. If they make the improvements I suggested (stronger zippers, straps, another set of locks on the 3rd zipper, another pocket, more padding it'd get that rating. But because of where it stands now with their QC issues, I stand by my 4/5 rating.

A boy rough and tumble teenager carried it through Middle School with 20 pounds of weight and a stainless steel water bottle it survived three years of being tossed around. He refuses to have any other book bag I bought him a namebrand and he will not use it because of how many pockets and the secret pocket That’s in the back to protect his phone. So we recently upgraded by buying the same exact thing but it seems to be better than the one that we had he said the zippers are different longer whatever that maybe he is on the spectrum so he notices small differences. And he was willing to change colors instead of gray we got black. When the bag came in I was sick and he made his book bag switch over which is a really big deal that’s how much he wanted to use it the only problem we had with his old book back is he got the mesh part caught on something and ripped it where his stainless steel water bottle went and that hole grew bigger. It never completely bottomed out but I didn’t want my son walking around with a beat up book bag that was three years old as a freshman in high school after purchasing a namebrand he doesn’t care about brands I just wanted him to fit in. I wasted my money on name that namebrand did not have all the features this one did especially that pocket which now I believe every book bag should have because my daughter does not have one and we’ve had issues with phones being stolen at school. They cannot put it in the outer pockets somebody will steal it or steal something out of their bag so important things need to be put in that hidden pocket that is up against the users back. It holds my son‘s laptop/Chromebook and every there are no lockers so everything he has for school is in that bag. Considering the last one was still usable it still is it’s just I would prefer a nicer cleaner look the gray I could’ve cleaned it yes but the black looks sleeker and they have seemed to have made improvement or the black it’s just different than the gray I don’t know. I am just this is a 10 out of a 10 recommendation. When you’ve got very very picky children where you have to buy multiples of everything if they like something he wears the same pair of pants to school every day they don’t care that it’s the same pair so you buy multiples. So I’m going to probably buy more of these book bags to get him through high school college and he wants an emergency book bag. Bag. As a family emergency plan every human has a book bag/bag it’s tactical to carry lifesaving emergency items.And we’re ahead of the game because his old book bag is still usable besides one mesh pocket the newer version that I’m reviewing right now I will say the pocket seems to be deeper than mesh pocket that is on the side that his water bottle goes in it seems to be larger than the last one it’s the same water bottle that he’s had For two school years in a row and it fits much tighter snugger and deeper.I used to feel like his water bottle was going to fall out it never did but the way it looked it made me feel that way as a neurodivergent person I hope other neurodivergent person can appreciate this review and the type of detailing I’m giving. And I am happy to come back with a video comparing the two. We did go with the larger size I wasn’t sure what I ordered a couple years ago size wise. I went to my orders I clicked on the book bag and there is options and I’m like what size did I order took the measuring tape and it said it was at least 17 inches so I knew he needed the 17 inch one. at pictures when trying to purchase is confusing when you click sizes if you click on the 15 inch some of the pictures are still the same as the 17 inch. So that is difficult to understand we do have the 17 inch I recommend that over the 15 inch. Yes it does cost more money but you get so much more with the few extra dollars. The shoulder straps are comfortable. They have never broken. At one point when we first got his original bag the doctor had to write a note due to his traumatic brain injury he has some health or physical conditions with his lungs and his book bag could not weigh more than 17 pounds. He was starting to have a hunch back bad posture and pain . Because there are no more lockers that’s not a thing where we live. But since then he’s grown seven in the year of 2023. I still feel like he shouldn’t be caring 20 pounds but it is helping build strength and his posture is much better with this book bag keeping his shoulders back . I do these reviews because that’s how I purchase items how I make decisions are based on reviews. My son is almost the same height as me I’m 5 foot 11. He is high-level now so I would say he’s 59 to 510 he’s about 100 pounds This book bag suits him wonderfully it is a book bag that I will be purchasing for myself. I don’t know the specs in terms of waterproof or anything like that. He does like the ability to put a charger in it a power bank. Each pocket has a specific purpose. And it didn’t change too much The outside pockets that are exposed are still well placed and in a way hidden. Still not a place to put a phone. Phones his does not go in his pocket most children I know use them in their pockets. Their school allows them to have phones. My son feels that he could be pickpocketed . So that zipper is a game changer. I have seen dupes of this book bag and they do not have that zipper it looks like it in the picture but it’s a mesh airflow there is no zipper there do not fall for the dupes I almost dead I almost purchased the wrong bag that’s why I always go back to my original order to re-order from. I favorite things. Unfortunately sometimes those things are no longer there we got lucky with this book bag. Now we have a namebrand from when I was in school that sort of useless it does not have the features nowhere near the features this book has for computer/tablet or laptop. Don’t waste your money on Jan sports. But again my kid does not care about brands I order the same shoe and the next size and have been for years I ordered the same pants and a different size and he wears them every single day he has the same pair of pants. with a genius IQ 4.925 GPA going for engineering a believes this is the best book bag well-made book bag there is. I am not as smart as my child just super neurodivergent spicy uses talk to text this review is for other neurodivergent people. I know I make very long posts or reviews. Too much to read. Details matter. For the people that will not read it this review is not for them for the people that need to know little details this is for you. And I will be back with pictures and videos highlighting the features that we like the most. I mean the user of the book bag. I will be the one highlighting them as he does not consent to being on camera. I will do my best to reinterpret his explanations of the features.

I liked the OGIO but it was impractical with four divided sections making each section too tight for actual stuffing. I bought a larger 40L Matien travel bag and thought this would make a great daily commuting bag, but it looks like this bag is all that I need. This bag has 1 large pouch that has two mesh pouches inside and a battery bank pocket. That puts nothing in your way of actually carrying a ton of stuff. On the front is a gear pouch for stuffing all of your accessory cables and an organization pouch. The two side zip up pockets are a bonus with water bottle holders. The back pocket holds your laptop and files and the anti-theft pouch in the back with the luggage strap. Perfect for traveling. The handle is soft and cushy so we will see how it holds up over time. The bag stands up by itself without falling over. This thing is awesome!In the pictures there are 2 pairs of jeans, 4 underwear and socks, three shirts and a set of pajamas. 7 USBC cords, 4 port USB charger, 1 mac charger, and a SSD drive. One Emirates travel bag full of supplies. One battery power bank. One 15"" Macbook pro. One Boox Max3. The 2 side pockets are Empty.The one thing I didn\'t like was the power bank pouch. You can see in the picture that it has no elastic whereas the 40L does and just adds that smidge of reassurance that it\'s not going to be flopping around. Other than that I have no complaints about this bag.This is a TSA travel bag which means that the laptop part is supposed to open and you\'re supposed to sail through the checkpoint. I\'ve never experienced where this works, if you can tell me how to do this great, the agents always tell me to remove my laptops and place them in their own bin so to me this is a wasted feature. If you know how to do this in according to how it\'s supposed to work let me know.Update: 7.17Just returned from my trip to Tanzania and this bag was literally all I needed. I would only need something else if I was going to buy massive amounts of souvenirs. I even over packed by a pair of jeans and shirts.

I pack a 17"" laptop, a 15.6 laptop and an iPad. Each are kept in a sleeve with their chargers. I also daily pack files that when stacked are about 3"" thick, the front pocket are packed with pens, mouse, portable charger etc....and more. All this and I can tell you I still have space for more stuff. The small pocket on top works well for keys, wallet, loose change , gate opener and works well. With all this weight the handle is holding up well; don\'t yank lol but to just pick it up and walk, normal use it handles the weight do problems. Not stretching, the seems aren\'t stressed.My only wish......I would have liked to have seen more inside zipper pickets in all the main areas. It has the space for it and it would give the owner plenty of ways to stay organized and he/she can choose as to how full to pack it. Just having the option would go along way, it wouldn\'t take up much more material and would give the consumer a feeling that someone really thought it through.

Travel wise....', 'author': 'Natayla', 'rating': 4, 'content': ""I bring my laptop, books, folders, iPad, etc. to school every day and spend most of my time on campus to finish homework or study before going home. My previous backpack gave me back pain because it was small, so this was a game changer. There are multiple pockets, enough room for extra items, and amazing padding on the back. The design is trendy and I bought the 17.3 inch BEIGE backpack during a sale.Is it waterproof? Yes! I walked through campus without an umbrella (didn't check the weather app) and none of my papers or electronics had a drop of waterIs it great for travel? Depends. The pockets allow you to store more items. However, I'd recommend buying a tiny lock if you're going to places with high stealing activity. The zippers are nice and smooth so it'll be easy to access your items within 5 seconds. This also means going through security checkpoints will be a breeze with how fluid the zipper is. If you're worried about someone having access to your items in crowded places, then I recommend looking for products with discreet zippers.If you're planning to use this to travel and will be bringing this everywhere when you're walking, I'd recommend finding ways to protect your items via locks or only using one compartment.Again, I mainly use this as a college student on a campus with not so much crime rate (that I know of). It's wonderful with its many compartments. My back doesn't hurt anymore and I can even fit my lunchbag in it. This also works for students in other grades (elementary, middle, or high school) with many textbooks or notebooks. Keep in mind the different sizes. It's not necessarily a rule but I think about how the backpack would look on my size. For example, you wouldn't buy the 18-inch backpack for a 1st-grade student."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 9, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great travel backpack', 'author': 'RM', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""This is a classy backpack that can replace your old briefcase.

I love that it has 6 pockets. And I love the water bottle holder on the outside. And I love how it attaches to a suitcase handle (sits on my carryon). It is very light when empty and will hold a lot. The zippers also seem to be good quality. And my 16"" macbook pro fits well.However, I\'m not sure how long it\'s going to last. The inside liner material is so thin it\'s like tissue paper. It offers almost no protection for a laptop because there is very little padding. If you have something soft in the same section as a computer it\'d probably be ok. I was a little nervous when my backpack fell at the airport but nothing was broken.I hope it lasts because it\'s great for travel and I really like it. I just wish the inside was of higher quality like the Jansport pack it replaced. The Jansport is almost 20 years old and still going strong (the blue color faded into purple so it\'s not my favorite no more).Update: Just completed a trip to Paris with this backpack. I had two 16"" macbook pro\'s in it, and I still had a ton of room for my other stuff. I had it so full it wouldn\'t fit under the seat in front me easily due to the budget airline\'s limited space. I like how it has so many pockets, I was well organized. My money and documents is in one of the pockets so I don\'t worry about money falling out while I\'m getting food or headphones. The strap that allows placing on a carryon wheeled baggage is super useful. Overall I\'m really impressed.

The Molle system allows for additional customization and attachment of extra pouches or gear. Plus, the numerous compartments and pockets help keep everything organized and easily accessible. However, I did find the shoulder straps to be a bit uncomfortable during extended wear, lacking sufficient padding for heavier loads.

Good space, waterproof, super lightweigth.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States March 1, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Great basic, simple, no-frills bag.', 'author': 'JLM', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'This is better than you would expect for an $18 backpack, but you aren\'t going to get $80 worth of features. I\'ve been using this bag about a month now on daily subway travel, and while I\'m happy with it, I know it probably won\'t be a have-it-forever bag, which is fine by me. I\'ve never had a subway commute before, so I just wanted to get a sense of whether I liked using a backpack or whether I needed to invest in a better shoulder bag, and for that, this fits the bill.I\'m a woman of fairly small stature, 5\'2 and petite all around, so I didn\'t want to feel like I was back in my middle school days with a backpack that made me look like an ersatz turtle clomping down the street. I wanted something fairly professional, slim, and with a little bit of something, not just another black backpack. And obviously, for a trial run, I didn\'t want to spend a lot.This bag in the blue color fit the bill. It\'s a very nice neutral blue, like a pair of jeans, so it goes with nearly everything. It doesn\'t appear to be showing dirt or grime yet, which is nice. The zippers are fairly high quality considering; I haven\'t had any issues with them sticking or getting jammed. The fabric appears to be a decent quality nylon and is fairly water resistant. I wouldn\'t call it waterproof, nor would I trust my computer in there in a heavy rainstorm without an umbrella or putting it under a jacket, but for a drizzle or minor shower everything inside has stayed dry.The lining is cheap nylon. Full stop. It will tear in time. But it\'s nicely designed, with an integrated front pocket big enough for a large-ish smart phone, car keys, metro card, chapstick, and a few other sundries without a problem. It\'s a deep pocket with a shallower ""shelf"" pocket, which is nice to keep the smaller things accessible. The main compartment is roomier than you\'d think, even with a 15 inch laptop inside. The laptop compartment is not very well padded, kind of not padded at all almost, but it\'s roomy. There are also two smaller pockets along the front of the main compartment, big enough for a cell phone, pens, that sort of stuff. And then the deep well easily fits a small umbrella, a Tupperware for lunch, a large-ish water bottle, and a large wallet, even with a laptop inside. I can also cram a packable rain jacket in there without trouble, though it starts to look kind of stuffed at that point.Don\'t labor under any delusions that this thing is going to magically distribute weight or anything like that. It won\'t. You are carrying your load on your shoulders. It\'s not super well padded, it\'s not super breathable. If you\'re looking for a bag that\'s going to be at your side 24/7 around the country or around the world, and be waterproof and super protective of all your stuff and be near weightless on your back and have 7000 pockets for all your little odds and ends, this ain\'t it. My husband is appalled at this bag, because his backpack has those 7000 dedicated pockets for odds and ends and he can\'t fathom life without that level of organization. And maybe my ""forever bag"" will have that. But for a cheap backpack for once in a while use, or the casual commuter, or someone who just wants to feel out using a backpack as a work bag rather than a more traditional shoulder bag, this is a great buy.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States November 18, 2019', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Second Purchase', 'author': 'Adolph Dixon', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I purchase this backpack almost two years ago.

Dragu', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""Alright folks, buckle up 'cause I've got to tell you all about this fantastic backpack I bought last year. Honestly, it's been my trusty sidekick ever since, and I can't imagine life without it now! Let me give you the lowdown on why this backpack is the real MVP.First things first, I love how slim this backpack is. I mean, I'm always guilty of overstuffing my bags with random stuff I don't need (guilty as charged!). But this backpack has been like my personal Marie Kondo, helping me declutter and carry only the essentials. And you know what? It's been a game-changer.Now, I've been taking this backpack with me on all my travels, and it's been an absolute dream. Flying with it is a walk in the park 'cause it's small enough that TSA never gives me any grief, and it fits snugly under the seat in front of me. No more awkwardly trying to shove an oversized bag into the overhead compartment, thank goodness!One thing I really appreciate about this backpack is how comfy it is to carry around all day. I've had my fair share of bags that left my shoulders and back aching by the end of the day, but not this one! It's like the backpack equivalent of a cozy hug, I'm telling ya!Now let's talk pockets. You know how some bags have a gazillion compartments and you can never find what you're looking for? Well, not with this backpack! It's got just the right amount of pockets, making it super easy to find everything I need. No more endless searching for that one pen or my headphones. It's like the backpack gods finally heard my prayers!There is just one teeny-tiny downside to this otherwise perfect bag. If you're like me and sometimes can't help but cram too much stuff in there, you might risk tearing the threads in the main compartment at the top. But I've learned my lesson and started being more mindful about what I pack. So really, it's more on me than the bag itself, right?In conclusion, considering the price, this backpack is hands down the best one I've ever had the pleasure of owning. It's stylish, slim, comfy, and easy to use – everything I could ask for in a backpack! So if you're on the hunt for the perfect backpack for your daily grind or your globetrotting adventures, look no further. This is the one, my friends! Trust me, you won't regret it!Here's a poem I wrote just for this:There once was a backpack, so slim and so fine,It changed how I traveled and made my days shine,I bought it last year, and it's now my best friend,Helping me carry my stuff 'round the bend.Its slimness, a blessing, I've come to embrace,No longer weighed down by stuff, I feel grace,It's been on my back on adventures afar,And breezing through TSA, we've raised the bar!This backpack of mine, it's a snug little hug,Comfort all day, no more shoulders to shrug,It's got just the pockets I need, oh so nifty,Finding my things now, so easy and swift-y!But listen up, folks, there's a lesson I've learned,From stuffing it full, some threads I have churned,So be mindful, dear friends, of what you pack in,Too much and you'll find, that it's quite a sin.For the price, it's a steal, this bag oh so grand,The best backpack ever, in all of the land,So if you need something slim, comfy, and fun,Look no further, my friend, this bag's the home run!Humor and rhyme, in this tale of my sack,Trust me, you'll love it, it's got your back!"", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States April 17, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect, Compact, Inconspicuous looking backpack', 'author': 'Burvy', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'This backpack fits all of my stuff in it perfectly, and no space looks wasted.

The backpacks themselves are durable and just the right size for the kids. I would say they are comparable to other canvas type backpacks out there that are 2-3 times the cost. The backpacks can easily hold a binder, a notebook, a pencil case, a lunch, a few books, and a sweater with room to spare - keeping in mind that this is for elementary school kids again...our kids are young so they don\'t carry much at all. If you\'re planning on carrying a High School load of text books, you may want to consider getting the larger sized backpack. The stitching at the seams is durable and we\'ve had no issues with torn seams or canvas. The zipper also runs very smoothly.Because the backpacks are solid in color, we ended up decorating the backpacks with acrylic paint to spice things up. The paint dries well on the canvas, looks vibrant, and give the backpack an extra protective coat. If you\'re considering drawing on the backpack with Sharpie, keep in mind that Sharpie on canvas tends to bleed a bit, and won\'t look quite as vibrant. You can also remove the ""Everest"" label very easily if you don\'t want the tab there and clean the material underneath with a toothbrush and stain stick - the coloring under the label will come right off. If you want a good glossy finish, you can also finish the painting with a clear acrylic coat.

It was a little smaller than I thought, but medium will fit regular size school books. If your child has big school books or has a lot of them you might want to get a bigger size. The outside pocket is big enough to hold pencils or pencil sharpeners. The inside fits all my elementary school students binders, winter hoodie, and library books.

My only complaint so far is that when I have my lunch in my bag, it becomes slightly unbalanced and my binder falls forward or back when walking. There isn't really any stiff structure to the bag so the laptop sleeve it's relatively flimsy. Between the stain, lack of structure, and my water having fallen out of the side pocket (to be fair it was a quite large cup and I bent forward) that's why one star was removed.

I have a few minor pet peeves related to the ergonomics of this bag though. It may help with its resistance to rain, but the flap that covers the zipper overlaps quite a bit and is not very flexible so sometimes it’s hard to unzip it in one smooth movement.

It is very sturdy and does not stretch the stitches apart at the shoulder straps like another brand of laptop backpack I once had. The back of the outermost laptop compartment is well padded, which protects the laptop and also makes the backpack more comfortable to wear. I have not had the opportunity to use the USB charging port, but I'm glad it's there, just in case.I really like the mesh outer pockets on both sides of the backpack for my keys and smartphone when I'm walking (I walk in a low crime area). The pockets would be good for a water bottle or small thermos, too. The red and white tabs on the backpack are highly reflective for safety after dark.

Free Shipping (Amazon Prime). Received in two days.Easily holds MBP 15"" with a protective sleeve, plus several notebooks (paper or digital) and/or binders, charger(s), a light-weight jacket or sweater, miscellaneous small personal stuff, orthe computer/notebook, charger(s), overnight change of clothes, a small makeup bag,Good for day-to-day commuter use, or as personal item or carry-on for air travel.Worth the price (so far).OVERALL:i wouldnʻt ask this to protect a laptop from a 5-6ʻ fall off your shoulder onto a hard surface, like just dropping the backpack onto a hard floor - if the computer survived more than a couple of times, iʻd consider the aluminum-silicon gods being extra generous. However, if you fell off your bike while wearing it, and you absorbed part of the fall, i think your laptop and backpack might come out ok. (yeah, iʻve gone through that before, donʻt want to test this back pack with that, though.) Good capacity and access. Construction should stand up to light-moderate use (up to 8-10 lb).DETAILS:Outer shell:medium duty polyester knit fabric: the manufacturer/vendor answering a question says it is 900 denier; not outback trekking material, but good enough for around-town commuter use. reported as water resistant, feels like it, but i donʻt plan to deliberately test it just yet. The front, bottom, and back outer shell is lined with a thin padding that feels like maybe 1/8"" poly-something, the kind of material used for wrapping light-weight things for packing, The back of the pack has an additional foam padding, not super thick, adds a bit of protection for contents, but possibly more for providing wearer comfort. Construction feels adequate for carrying a computer and a few light things (notebooks, jacket, etc.) up to about 8-10 lbs to me.Interior lining:medium-light weight polyester. The entire backpack is lined and divided with this material. Feels as though it too might be water resistant, although, again, iʻm not testing it.zippers: medium duty(?) nylon. one very light-duty combination padlock included.shoulder straps: 2 1/4"" wide seam-to-seam, padding 2"" wide.hand strap (top): 7 1ʻ2"" long, 1"" wide, 3/8"" thick (thick medium dense material core, like urethane foam?)luggage cart strap: on the back surface of the backpack, allows it to be plunked onto the top of rolling luggage by the rolling luggage handle, and prevented from falling off.reflector tabs: 1/2"" x 3/4"" (4x), 1"" x 3/4"" (1x)Side Pockets: 6"" deep, 4 3/4"" wide, 3/8"" wide elastic cuff expands from 5"" to ~7"". Synthetic (Poly or Nylon?) mesh, 3/8"" elastic opening cuff. Holds a 3 1/4"" wide water bottleMain cargo section:interior dimensions:5 3/4"" deep at base, tapering to 3 1/12"" at top.12"" wide at base, a mild taper to 11 3/4"" at the top of the laptop pocket, and the last 1 1/4"" of height tapers from 10 1/2"" to 7"" width.17 3/4ʻ tall.Lots of room for laptop, and a two inch 3-ring binder, or one or two textbooks, notebooks, etc. Someone in the questions section of the reviews said this can hold a 5"" binder: it probably could hold a laptop and that,, but i suspect not much else. Maybe the 17"" or the 18.4"" models have deeper capacity.laptop pocket is a 1"" deep bellows- or safari style pocket, so it isnʻt stretched to accomodate even my MacBook Pro 15ʻ Unibody in padded sleeve. The pocket is 12"" tall, so the entire laptop fits in the pocket. The inner-facing side of the pocket is lightly padded, so it will last longer, and protect the computer somewhat from scratching or denting by any hard objects you might have in the main cargo section of the backpack.Pass through for USB and headphone cables. Pass-through is NOT watertight! rubber strain relief around the holes in the fabric, but no rain deflector like on the larger model of backpack. moisture can get in, depending on how heavy the rain or spill is.Secondary section:interior dimensions1 7/8"" deep at base, tapering to 1 1/4"" at top11"" wide at base, tapering to 9"" near the top15"" tall at the zipperpatch pockets, main one is 5"" deep, 9"" height to zipper, sewn onto divider wall between secondary compartment and main cargo compartment.Organizer compartment11"" at base, tapering to 9"" at top15"" tallzipper opening reaches to 10"" height.flat profileEssentially, a patch pocket with a zipper opening, the front surface is the padded/lined shell, the inner side the same interior lining as everything else.three patch-style credit card-sized RFID pockets. not tested for effectiveness yet.Should be able to tuck a notebook in this space, but probably not anything wider than a 3/4"" 3-ring binder, unless you donʻt mind swiping volume from the other compartments.WHAT I LIKE:PROTECTION:MOST of the the outer shell is padded (albeit lightly). It should protect from casual bumps agains desks, shelves, etc.CAPACITY:The shell feels like it will stand up to day-to-day light-to medium duty use. Construction is adequate for carrying about 10-12 pounds. More than that would probably start to strain seams, handles, and zippers.LOTS of capacity for a 15"" laptop (even the MacBook Pro Unibody) in a foam sleeve, plus charger, note pads (paper or digital), one or two medium to large books, a light jacket.For air travel, I can probably squeeze my purse inside and use the back pack as my ""personal item"". Even stuffed to capacity, this probably will fit under most airline seats.ACCESSIBILITY:The Main and Secondary compartments have wide openings: the Main compartment opens 12"" from the top on both sides (double zipper), the Secondary opens 8"" from the top, also double zipper. The front organizer pocket easily holds my iPad 2021 in its sleeve, so pulling it out at airport security is no problem. Depending on how much stuff i have packed, the laptop should easily come out and go back into its pocket as well.ORGANIZATION:Each of the compartments (Main, Secondary, Organizer) is large enough to accommodate a notebook/notepad. Organizing paper documents is much easier with this rather than a single compartment or with small compartments.oh yeah, the PURPLE is awesome.WHAT I WISH:MORE PADDING:The sides and top of the backpack are not padded - just the outer shell and inner lining. I wish these were padded, to help cushion falls/drops/bumps. iʻm kind of klutzy at times, and so every bit of protection helps.The separations between compartments are made of the interior lining fabric only; i wish these were also padded, as they would add protection and also give more body to the Secondary and Organizer compartments.The shoulder straps have thin padding (1/8""?): because they are 2"" wide, it should mitigate the cutting into my shoulders, but i tend to overload my backpack, so extra padding is always welcome.STRONGER ZIPPERS: the bane of my existence. i hope these zippers last the two years i want to get out of this backpack. not super confident, but if i donʻt overload it, i might make it.BIGGER/DEEPER SIDE POCKET with drawstring closure: i carry 3 1/4"" dia. 1 liter bottles with insulation; the side pockets just fit them, without insulating pouch, while they do fit, the 6"" depth and elastic cuff seem a bit limited for larger water bottles. I guess itʻs a trade-off, since the pockets are just deep enough so that they donʻt interfere with the main compartment zippers.Cord Passthrough unnecessary: for me, putting holes in a backpack doesnʻt make sense - itʻs just somewhere for moisture to get in. Headsets are going Bluetooth, and if you need to charge your handheld device, itʻs probably at the point where you shouldnʻt be using it anyway, and can just put it in the backpack to charge with whatever portable recharger you carry with you.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 16, 2022', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great', 'author': 'Justin A Jones', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I use this for work and can fit everything I need in it.

I got it for its dimensions for an international travel carryon to maximize cubic inches (AerLingus, to be exact).I stuffed it full, and along with my medium sized Lug bag, I could’ve gone full carryon/no checked baggage if I’d been just a bit more disciplined because they’re really is a TON of room in this backpack.My only complaints are:1. There are only about two internal pockets that have zippers. I expected more of those.2. The laptop storage area, while ample and well-designed in that it has a wide elastic strap with Velcro at the end, has ZERO padding between the laptop and the exterior or bottom of the backpack. Not a problem while you’re wearing it, but *very* concerning if you’re stowing this in overhead bins on airplanes or public transit with your precious laptop inside. **So you’ll want to get a very protective laptop sleeve to use inside this backpack.**3. No anti-theft technology other than double zippers that have holes large enough to accept luggage locks. I did get TSA-approved combination locks elsewhere on Amazon, and they’ve been great.4. The chest strap is bizarre because it’s not long enough to go across an adult human’s chest. It’s only about seven inches long. That’s confusing. Maybe I’m misunderstanding something there.The clamshell feature for the electronics area *might* be pointless because the backpack is so tall. I say “might” because perhaps you’ll have a more favorable experience than mine, below:AerLingus, as of July 2023, does not have a contract with TSA 🤔, so I couldn’t use my KTN to get through security faster. 🤯 🤷\u200d♀️ Thus, I had to put this backpack in a security bin and remove my laptop, portable monitor, and Kindle.I asked if I could just unzip it all the way and lie it flat Like a clamshell, but the security agent kindly pointed out that when opened all the way, this backpack extends beyond the boundaries of the (quite large) security bin, so he said I indeed had to remove all my electronics.I don’t know if every agent would've said that, but that was my experience this time.I do understand that to include the upgrades listed here that I’d like to see, it would cost a lot more for this backpack. So, for the money, I’m pretty satisfied with this purchase, especially because it has a TON of room and double zippers that accept luggage locks for all the outer compartments. (My Lug bag, while much more stylish, has zippers that do not accept luggage locks; the holes in the zipper pulls are way too small! 😥)Given that this backpack has no other anti-theft technology, I’ll probably be investing in a PacSafe bag next. HOWEVER, this backpack has worked out very well for functionality.I got it just a couple of days before my trip, so it really helped me out in a pinch. If you’re on a budget and/or need it super fast, then this is a great choice!Btw, my weight limit was 10kg, and this could’ve held a lot more than that. However, I’m not strong enough to carry around that much weight all day. So bigger isn’t always better.After arriving at my destination and unpacking, I used this backpack for grocery shopping in areas that have public transit and we didn’t rent a car. This backpack was perfect for that! Just make sure to still put most food items, such as dairy, sugary items, sauces, powders/flour, and anything else that would be difficult to clean into plastic grocery bags before putting them into your backpack. This way, in case anything leaks, your investment will be protected and you won’t smell gross for the rest of your trip!I really do recommend this backpack if you need something fast, need a 10 kg bag for travel to the UK and want to maximize your cubic inches of space, after winning to purchase a separate, very cushioning laptop sleeve, want to make it fast and easy to remove your electronics at security if needed, and/or you’re on a budget.If you can afford to spend $50+ more, you might want to look elsewhere."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States July 10, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Good quality', 'author': 'Karen M.', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I absolutely love this back pack.

Most other sling bags I looked at were either too large (fit full frame or too many lenses) or too small and would not fit a Sony a6700 with a lens attached. This bag can fit the a6700 with a lens attached and several accessories. Note that it will not fit a full frame camera with a lens attached in any orientation, though one will fit without a lens attached and the lens stored next to it.Shown in the pictures are my primary kit of the a6700 with the 24mm f2.8G attached and the 50mm f1.8 OSS. Beneath the divider shelf is a Peak Design Slide strap. It will even fit the camera with the 70-350 G attached. Not shown are the microfiber cloth, UV filter, and spare SD card in the interior zippered pocket. Closing the bag was difficult at first, but the material stretched slightly after leaving everything in the bag overnight and now it is a perfect fit.My only minor complaint is that the strap was not removable and also not easily adjustable. Since my use case was to have a bag I could grab and throw in the car or carry as a sling bag, I decided to cut off the strap and add the Peak Design anchors. This way I can use the Slide strap to either carry the bag and quickly adjust it to fit, or use the strap on the camera based on my needs at the moment.Materials are pretty good and fit and finish is good.

So the depth of where you will put your camera and lenses could be deeper if it wasn't split into 2 compartments but you actually don't have that much as you would think. I am using small/medium lenses in my photos. Something like a 24-105 would not be flush with the main compartment.

I wish there was at least another hard cover on the other front pouch to take the damage and force , but since there isn't I can see the front bottom pouch getting shredded over time.Also the fact you have to open the main compartment with the front down mean you have to keep zipping it up to then flip back around to get to the front pockets. This bag slowed me down on a recent shoot a lotlIf you swing the backpack around to the front to grab the camera on one of the side zippers that go to the main compartment the camera will be upside down because of that reason that it has to open face down.I love the included waist strap that you can attach or take off.

So, last year I decided to get the North Face Vault backpack for my son in middle school. He liked that it was black and that it had sturdy straps. I'm going to point out the pros and cons:Pros: very sturdy and can put 1 Chromebook (has it's own pocket for laptops/chromebooks), 3 books, and about 3-5 folders/notebooks. Yes, that's a lot for a middle school, but we tested the backpack out putting in as much stuff as possible when we first got it. There are 2 front pockets. One is larger than the other. My son put his pens/pencils, etc. in the smaller pocket. The bigger pocket had his earbud case, calculator, and other small items for his classes. There are 2 side pockets for water bottles. The zippers are easy to grasp all around with 2 separate zipper pulls. The straps are thick and there is a strap you can tie around your waist area for more security and support.Cons: the mesh-style water bottle holders aren't very well sewn. One of them broke after a month. Granted, you are going to constantly take out and put back your water bottles so I thought the holders should have held up for at least one school year, right? The backpack itself is pretty heavy with nothing in it. So, be prepared to carry a very heavy backpack if your child's school doesn't have lockers for them to put their stuff in and they have to carry their books and laptops all day.Overall, this backpack held up well enough for about one year and a half. I did notice some of the seams on the front pockets become looser but that could just be a user issue. The ripped water bottle holders on the side being ripped so easily could have been made with higher quality material or stitching.I think it's a nice looking backpack. It's not flashy and it has a small North Face logo."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 17, 2022', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars A present for my Wife', 'author': 'Jack CPA', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I have a black North Face Recon.

As it stands now, good solid bag for the price and it does fit larger laptops.Update Feb 16, 2015:Been using this backpack on a daily basis while traveling to work and while traveling on business trips. Works great still! It has been the perfect companion bag and fits under the seat in front of you on an airplane so that it is easily accessible. If you are doing a one day trip or longer it has been very versatile on all occasions. I can have a couple days change of clothes with me and only have to carry on with me a suit, everything else is in the backpack. I may consider buying another for a B.O.B., still debating on something a bit more tactical otherwise. One last note, the grab handle on the top of the pack is extremely strong and can manage being yanked on regularly.If there are any major issues with the backpack I will note it later. You can buy this product with confidence.September 2015There are two recent flaws with the pack and not over excessive use either. The stitching for the water bottle holders are a bit weak and will eventually lose their attachment to the pack. Also, I was surprised to have one of the retention straps to fall off. The stitching is not as good as expected. I did not overload my bag, just nice and snug and one day if found the strap hanging on only by the clip. Still a nice design overall, but just a few discrepancies to be noted over time and general use. I don\'t want to speculate, but I will, this bag will have a good life expectancy in general use, but not if you think about a short B.O.B.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States July 8, 2014', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': ""5.0 out of 5 stars The unabatingly impressive backpack that I didn't even realize I wanted"", 'author': 'Adam', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I travel a lot for business and I used a laptop case to carry my files, receipts, laptop, chargers, etc. As an airline carry-on option, the laptop case was convenient because of its size, but it had one strap, and I was finding that my tendency to put it on my right shoulder over the years was causing my back to go a little out of whack, and switching sides constantly was not the solution I needed.This backpack was discounted a bit for Black Friday, and having seen the quality of AmazonBasics products before, I knew that $30 was a fair price and I expected a decent product based on the reviews. When it arrived, I was able to take everything from my laptop case - passport, flash drive, files, chargers and more - and transfer it into this backpack with ease. There are dedicated pockets that are intelligently sized (there is one small pocket that is flash-drive-shaped, which was amazing). And, because of the way it\'s constructed, it\'s smaller and lighter than my laptop case. From the beginning, I was impressed, but that was only the beginning.The backpack itself complies with my airline\'s (and, let\'s be reasonable, most airlines\') definition of a ""personal item"" rather than ""carry-on luggage,"" whereas my laptop case was too wide to be considered a personal item (though most airlines wouldn\'t bug you, still, it\'s always better to be able to point to the regulation and say you\'re in the right!). This bag maximizes economy of space brilliantly, and fits under the seat in front of you on the plane, so no rummaging through the overhead compartments looking for your bag. I thought the bag couldn\'t get any better, but it didn\'t stop there.I was initially concerned about whether having a backpack rather than a laptop case would appear ""unprofessional,"" but as a traveling salesperson, it didn\'t appear that anyone judged me for having a backpack rather than a case. The zippers are strong and large, so no cheap metal or plastic breaking on you as you try to open a zipper that got stuck on cloth. Everything is laid out very well. Having all my chargers, cables and files handy was useful during my presentations, when I was able to pull out hotspots, folders and other things with ease, and even keep my coins together for easy reach while paying tolls.I\'m excited to use this backpack for personal 1-2 day trips also, because I can definitely fit a bit of clothing in the other pocket I didn\'t use (there was so much space, I didn\'t need to!) and be able to travel in a plane, train or automobile without having to worry about lugging around...well, luggage. The side compartment is perfect for the average bottle of water, for people that want to use this backpack in the outdoors or for long trips, and just about any laptop will fit inside the slit in the back.If the events of Amazon\'s history as a company in the last two decades had only culminated in the design of this backpack, that would honestly be enough to justify its existence. Of course, I\'m exaggerating, but this backpack is yet another example among the many reasons more and more of my purchases are being made through Amazon. Their reputation for quality and economy of design understates the achievements of this backpack, which sets standards beyond all those previously achieved by Amazon.Thank you again, Amazon, and I look forward to seeing what the next item is that you decide to improve in ways I didn\'t even realize I wanted.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 14, 2015', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent budget-friendly backpack', 'author': 'Trevor', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Pros: Cheap, budget friendly A LOT of storage options Does not sag downwards like some other bags Still holding up very well after months of use Large laptop section fits multiple sizes of laptops comfortably, even my 15.5""Cons: Zips seem to be of not-so-good quality, prone to getting caught on inside seams and is sometimes difficult to operate Water bottle pouches are small, and require some shoehorning Laptop pouch offers nominal protection, not too bad, but could be betterAs you can see, the cons really aren\'t cons that one can\'t live with. I have had this backpack for months now, and I use it to transport books, computers, even clothes for a long weekend. It has held up well so far. I am especially appreciative of the fact that the base is well supported, meaning that if I had nothing really in the main compartments and a bunch of stuff in the outermost compartment, the backpack still maintains its shape and doesn\'t sag down too much, if at all, unlike certain cloth-bottomed backpacks.There are more storage compartments on this than a person will require, including 5 zippered compartments, (2 large, 1 sort of large, 1 medium and 1 small) the largest of which is internally divided into 3. It should be noted that the upper compartment on the front (as seen in the main product picture) actually extends all the way to the bottom. There are also 2 water bottle holders and a pen / iPod nano / earphone holder on the left strap.The straps are padded somewhat, and relatively comfortable, and I truly have no idea what functional purpose the clips have just above the water bottle holders on either side. They look good though, so I\'m not complaining. The water bottle holders are, however, a little small, so some fenangling may be required to stuff in a larger bottle. It is, however, very nice that there are two holders instead of the usual one.My only gripe with this bag are the zippers, which seem to be of relatively low quality. They do not zip or unzip smoothly, and are prone to getting caught on the inside seams. I am quite afraid that they will eventually split or break off, they truly do not inspire confidence.Overall, I absolutely enjoy this backpack and would recommend it to anyone looking for a budget-friendly backpack that can easily leave its more expensive cousins with a bloody nose. It also doesn\'t hurt that I much prefer the simpler design and I think it looks great.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 7, 2015', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars [Update1 06/27] Fits my 17.3"" Dell Precision M6600 (Sort Of)', 'author': 'Farhan K', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'The media could not be loaded. Update 1 - 06/27 - Approximately one week after my purchase of this Backpack, I got an email from Amazon ""Your purchase of the AmazonBasics Backpack for Laptops Up To 17-Inch comes with 6 months of FREE Unlimited Online Storage from Amazon Cloud Drive (a $29.99 value) "" . Wow this was unexpected and a pleasant surprise as I did not read of this promotion anywhere in the description and it basically pays itself of the entire cost of the Backpack. I am not sure if this is a temporary or permanent promotion.Original Review : I purchased the AmazonBasics Backpack half expecting to return it as I was not entirely sure if it could fit my huge 17.3"" Dell Precision M6600 Mobile workstation that I use for work . I mean this laptop is big, thick and heavy - It weighs in excess of 8 pounds and is measures 19.5"" inches diagonal externally. But as you can see in my video that it has no issues swallowing my laptop with the least amount of shoehorning or protrusion - So I would declare this a fit , granted that the laptop will only fit in the main compartment outside the laptop sleeve. (see my video) Space, Build Quality & Comfort ------------------------------------------- The backpack has tons of space and compartments (almost too many for my requirements) to carry anything you can think of. I carry mainly my office laptop, powerbank, stationery , towels, lunchbox, headphones, documents and the occasional tablet in it daily with plenty of room to spare- The material of the backpack is fairly good for its price but its certainly not Jansport good.- With all the stuff I carry around my backpack weighs in excess of 12 pounds. Even with this heavy weight I find it comfortable to wear on my shoulders with no unnecessary stress or fatigue points on my body- The shoulder straps seem to be holding up to the 12 pound weight fairly well so far. I will update if that changes in the long run- As you can see it has no issues fitting my 17.3"" Dell Precision M6600The Good------------------ Had loads of space and compartments to swallow anything you throw at it and is expandable further- Build quality is surprisingly good at this price point- Zippers glide smoothly- Good looking- Comfortable - Even weighing at 12 pounds after I put my stuff into it, I found it comfortable to wear on my shoulders. Its padded in the right placesThe Not So Good-------------------------- The only minor issue I found so far was an aesthetic one - Because its designed to be expandable and carry so much stuff - If you dont put a lot of things in it , the front part collapses and looks weird and squishy (see my video) . I wish that Amazon would have provided it a more rigid structure- Laptops greater than 17 inches will not fit in the laptop sleeve - They will only fit outside it in the main compartment.Overall I am very satisfied with my purchase and it is really a great value for money option which fulfills my need of fitting my large laptop ,have sufficient space to carry other stuff like my lunchbox, chargers and still be comfortable to wear', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States June 25, 2016', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars So pleased with this bag!', 'author': 'Jeffrey', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I bought this laptop backpack because I have been spending 3 days of my week in Coffee Shoppe’s while my husband is working. He doesn’t work well at home so each day I have been packing up a cloth grocery bag with snacks, bottled water, my laptop, my kindle ect and going with him to spend the day in different coffee shops around my city.Lugging all my stuff around on the bus in a cloth grocery back was so difficult and I had been looking for a good back pack that wasn’t too expensive, but still good quality and that had plenty of room for all the stuff I need and bring with me. After searching for a while and seeing that even normal Jansport backpacks that aren’t designed to carry laptops were $50 or more I was getting discouraged until I came across this Gem!This Bag carries 2 large laptops with a special area for both, has a holder for my water bottle, several individual pockets for things like my keys, medications, and snacks. It has a built in wallet type area that will fit cell phones, pens, pencils, small notebooks.Plus 2 or 3 outer pockets on the bag itself for smaller items.One of my biggest worries when looking to buy was that the laptop would be slamming against my back while I wore it. But this bag has plenty of cushioning between the back and where the laptop is stored.This bag would work for Students in place of a laptop case, or could easily be used for hikers or campers. It is versatile and has cushioning on the shoulder/arm pads and a handle for comfortable holding and wearing.The material seems strong and put together well.For the price on this product it is so worth it in my opinion. Normal Backpacks with way less storage can go for so much money and I was able to get this for $25.29!My only real disappointment was that there were no options to personalize it to my taste. I didn’t get a color choice like you do with most back packs or laptop cases. This is a black back pack with small areas of orange threads. While Orange is not my favorite it is subtle enough that I was okay with not having an option on color. Overall the bag appears like a normal back pack would, with an affordable price and a variety of pockets and holders on the bag that make up for the lack of color options!I am so pleased with this purchase and so glad I decided to get it!', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States June 17, 2016', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '3.0 out of 5 stars Sturdy bag, cheap mesh pockets', 'author': 'NkW', 'rating': 3, 'content': 'The bag itself works well.

Prior to this back ive used a couple JanSport bags, and a Hiking bag.Ill try to get back with edits if anything changes.Pockets:Inside the main bag compartment there is a nice pocket that perfectly fits my 13 in Razer Blade Stealth inside a neoprene sleeve. This compartment is well padded, making me confident that my laptop will be protected from the contents in the main compartment.Right above that is a smaller zipper pocket that fits my laptop charger perfectly, This pocket is not padded.The main compartment has two more small open pockets, these are unpadded and have no zipper. This means that any of your items in this pocket can potentially fall out if you toss your bag around. I personally don't keep much in these pockets that can be damaged.The smaller compartment is nice and wide, usually i keep some small flash drives and my mouse in here. Again this is not padded so i don't put anything that can be damaged in here.Finally, on the outside of the bag you will get two side pockets with some velcro to keep them shut need be. I usually just throw an energy drink or bottled water on the go.Comfort:This bag has some pretty thin bag straps. This is fine for short durations, however for longer durations or with more things in my bag, it can start to get pretty uncomfortable quickly. I would have liked this bag to have slightly wider and softer straps. However for the price, this is not a bad trade-off.Aesthetic:This bag is plain. That is in no way an understatement. Its an all black bag with no accents or logo tags. When you open the bag, the inside has some light grey, which actually helps me find things on the bottom with less light.Price:If you need a bag that will do its job on the cheap then this is an amazing product. I personally have no issue saving some money and dealing with the shoulder straps. For the $12, this is the best price to performance bag i've personally used.Final Thoughts/Summary:The straps are a bit uncomfortable, however i would still get this over a JanSport for one main reason, this bag has some of the most useful pockets for in the main compartment for my needs. I would easily feel comfortable paying another $8 for this same bag and feel like i got a great deal. If you carry a good amount of heavy books then i would look for something with more padded shoulder straps, however if you are just moving from class to class, or in my case office to car to apartment, then i would wholeheartedly recommend this.Edit 1: I was wrong. There is a tag on the strap, its very discreet however i just cut mine off."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 9, 2016', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Absolutely Worth The Price', 'author': 'EJ', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I spent a lot of time looking for a very simple back pack to throw some spare work clothes in and eventually settled on this one. There isn't much to be said other than it is a simple backpack with a large front pocket and a more than reasonably sized main compartment.

I am extremely particular about my backpack. My favorite backpack died a few months ago and I have been desperately seeking a good replacement. I cycle to and from work every day for 18 mi and have gone through about 6 amazon backpacks in the last 3 months. Like Goldilocks, I\'m 4\' 11"" woman and size matters. 1 was too big (30 L), one was too small (15L barely carried my sneakers), some were too heavy (waterproof wet bag), some had too many stupid pockets (freeknight, who needs a helmet net??), one was super lightweight and a decent 20L but the straps aren\'t padded enough and cut into my shoulders when I had too much stuff in it (New Outlander). But this Amazon Basics one is just right. It\'s so simple really. Roomy, good depth and width, carries all of my gym clothes, shoes, laptop and room to spare, padded inside pocket, small zippered internal pocket for important stuff, huge front pocket for random stuff, 2 sizeable side pockets for easy access to key/cards/cell phone with velcro to close (genius)! So few backpacks have velcro on the side pockets. It\'s either wide open and easy for stuff to fall out, or zippered which makes it not-so-easy to access. The color is SOOOO pretty! I love this vibrant baby blue!! It\'s so comfortable to bike with it!! I put it on and it felt just right!!! Seriously, for $15, I want to get 10 of them in every color and store them in the basement, just in case they get discontinued in 2020. I want to buy one for all my friends and family members. I want to wear it out on a hot date. I want to... oh you get the picture. Construction looks great and hopefully it lasts a year. I sprayed the entire backpack with Granger\'s waterproofing spray and tested it in the shower and water rolls right off of it. Now it\'s an even awesomer water-resistant backpack. Couldn\'t be happier. Wish I didn\'t spend over $100 on all the other backpacks that I will now be giving away.

Free Shipping (Amazon Prime). Received in two days.Easily holds MBP 15"" with a protective sleeve, plus several notebooks (paper or digital) and/or binders, charger(s), a light-weight jacket or sweater, miscellaneous small personal stuff, orthe computer/notebook, charger(s), overnight change of clothes, a small makeup bag,Good for day-to-day commuter use, or as personal item or carry-on for air travel.Worth the price (so far).OVERALL:i wouldnʻt ask this to protect a laptop from a 5-6ʻ fall off your shoulder onto a hard surface, like just dropping the backpack onto a hard floor - if the computer survived more than a couple of times, iʻd consider the aluminum-silicon gods being extra generous. However, if you fell off your bike while wearing it, and you absorbed part of the fall, i think your laptop and backpack might come out ok. (yeah, iʻve gone through that before, donʻt want to test this back pack with that, though.) Good capacity and access. Construction should stand up to light-moderate use (up to 8-10 lb).DETAILS:Outer shell:medium duty polyester knit fabric: the manufacturer/vendor answering a question says it is 900 denier; not outback trekking material, but good enough for around-town commuter use. reported as water resistant, feels like it, but i donʻt plan to deliberately test it just yet. The front, bottom, and back outer shell is lined with a thin padding that feels like maybe 1/8"" poly-something, the kind of material used for wrapping light-weight things for packing, The back of the pack has an additional foam padding, not super thick, adds a bit of protection for contents, but possibly more for providing wearer comfort. Construction feels adequate for carrying a computer and a few light things (notebooks, jacket, etc.) up to about 8-10 lbs to me.Interior lining:medium-light weight polyester. The entire backpack is lined and divided with this material. Feels as though it too might be water resistant, although, again, iʻm not testing it.zippers: medium duty(?) nylon. one very light-duty combination padlock included.shoulder straps: 2 1/4"" wide seam-to-seam, padding 2"" wide.hand strap (top): 7 1ʻ2"" long, 1"" wide, 3/8"" thick (thick medium dense material core, like urethane foam?)luggage cart strap: on the back surface of the backpack, allows it to be plunked onto the top of rolling luggage by the rolling luggage handle, and prevented from falling off.reflector tabs: 1/2"" x 3/4"" (4x), 1"" x 3/4"" (1x)Side Pockets: 6"" deep, 4 3/4"" wide, 3/8"" wide elastic cuff expands from 5"" to ~7"". Synthetic (Poly or Nylon?) mesh, 3/8"" elastic opening cuff. Holds a 3 1/4"" wide water bottleMain cargo section:interior dimensions:5 3/4"" deep at base, tapering to 3 1/12"" at top.12"" wide at base, a mild taper to 11 3/4"" at the top of the laptop pocket, and the last 1 1/4"" of height tapers from 10 1/2"" to 7"" width.17 3/4ʻ tall.Lots of room for laptop, and a two inch 3-ring binder, or one or two textbooks, notebooks, etc. Someone in the questions section of the reviews said this can hold a 5"" binder: it probably could hold a laptop and that,, but i suspect not much else. Maybe the 17"" or the 18.4"" models have deeper capacity.laptop pocket is a 1"" deep bellows- or safari style pocket, so it isnʻt stretched to accomodate even my MacBook Pro 15ʻ Unibody in padded sleeve. The pocket is 12"" tall, so the entire laptop fits in the pocket. The inner-facing side of the pocket is lightly padded, so it will last longer, and protect the computer somewhat from scratching or denting by any hard objects you might have in the main cargo section of the backpack.Pass through for USB and headphone cables. Pass-through is NOT watertight! rubber strain relief around the holes in the fabric, but no rain deflector like on the larger model of backpack. moisture can get in, depending on how heavy the rain or spill is.Secondary section:interior dimensions1 7/8"" deep at base, tapering to 1 1/4"" at top11"" wide at base, tapering to 9"" near the top15"" tall at the zipperpatch pockets, main one is 5"" deep, 9"" height to zipper, sewn onto divider wall between secondary compartment and main cargo compartment.Organizer compartment11"" at base, tapering to 9"" at top15"" tallzipper opening reaches to 10"" height.flat profileEssentially, a patch pocket with a zipper opening, the front surface is the padded/lined shell, the inner side the same interior lining as everything else.three patch-style credit card-sized RFID pockets. not tested for effectiveness yet.Should be able to tuck a notebook in this space, but probably not anything wider than a 3/4"" 3-ring binder, unless you donʻt mind swiping volume from the other compartments.WHAT I LIKE:PROTECTION:MOST of the the outer shell is padded (albeit lightly). It should protect from casual bumps agains desks, shelves, etc.CAPACITY:The shell feels like it will stand up to day-to-day light-to medium duty use. Construction is adequate for carrying about 10-12 pounds. More than that would probably start to strain seams, handles, and zippers.LOTS of capacity for a 15"" laptop (even the MacBook Pro Unibody) in a foam sleeve, plus charger, note pads (paper or digital), one or two medium to large books, a light jacket.For air travel, I can probably squeeze my purse inside and use the back pack as my ""personal item"". Even stuffed to capacity, this probably will fit under most airline seats.ACCESSIBILITY:The Main and Secondary compartments have wide openings: the Main compartment opens 12"" from the top on both sides (double zipper), the Secondary opens 8"" from the top, also double zipper. The front organizer pocket easily holds my iPad 2021 in its sleeve, so pulling it out at airport security is no problem. Depending on how much stuff i have packed, the laptop should easily come out and go back into its pocket as well.ORGANIZATION:Each of the compartments (Main, Secondary, Organizer) is large enough to accommodate a notebook/notepad. Organizing paper documents is much easier with this rather than a single compartment or with small compartments.oh yeah, the PURPLE is awesome.WHAT I WISH:MORE PADDING:The sides and top of the backpack are not padded - just the outer shell and inner lining. I wish these were padded, to help cushion falls/drops/bumps. iʻm kind of klutzy at times, and so every bit of protection helps.The separations between compartments are made of the interior lining fabric only; i wish these were also padded, as they would add protection and also give more body to the Secondary and Organizer compartments.The shoulder straps have thin padding (1/8""?): because they are 2"" wide, it should mitigate the cutting into my shoulders, but i tend to overload my backpack, so extra padding is always welcome.STRONGER ZIPPERS: the bane of my existence. i hope these zippers last the two years i want to get out of this backpack. not super confident, but if i donʻt overload it, i might make it.BIGGER/DEEPER SIDE POCKET with drawstring closure: i carry 3 1/4"" dia. 1 liter bottles with insulation; the side pockets just fit them, without insulating pouch, while they do fit, the 6"" depth and elastic cuff seem a bit limited for larger water bottles. I guess itʻs a trade-off, since the pockets are just deep enough so that they donʻt interfere with the main compartment zippers.Cord Passthrough unnecessary: for me, putting holes in a backpack doesnʻt make sense - itʻs just somewhere for moisture to get in. Headsets are going Bluetooth, and if you need to charge your handheld device, itʻs probably at the point where you shouldnʻt be using it anyway, and can just put it in the backpack to charge with whatever portable recharger you carry with you.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 16, 2022', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great', 'author': 'Justin A Jones', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I use this for work and can fit everything I need in it.

I got it for its dimensions for an international travel carryon to maximize cubic inches (AerLingus, to be exact).I stuffed it full, and along with my medium sized Lug bag, I could’ve gone full carryon/no checked baggage if I’d been just a bit more disciplined because they’re really is a TON of room in this backpack.My only complaints are:1. There are only about two internal pockets that have zippers. I expected more of those.2. The laptop storage area, while ample and well-designed in that it has a wide elastic strap with Velcro at the end, has ZERO padding between the laptop and the exterior or bottom of the backpack. Not a problem while you’re wearing it, but *very* concerning if you’re stowing this in overhead bins on airplanes or public transit with your precious laptop inside. **So you’ll want to get a very protective laptop sleeve to use inside this backpack.**3. No anti-theft technology other than double zippers that have holes large enough to accept luggage locks. I did get TSA-approved combination locks elsewhere on Amazon, and they’ve been great.4. The chest strap is bizarre because it’s not long enough to go across an adult human’s chest. It’s only about seven inches long. That’s confusing. Maybe I’m misunderstanding something there.The clamshell feature for the electronics area *might* be pointless because the backpack is so tall. I say “might” because perhaps you’ll have a more favorable experience than mine, below:AerLingus, as of July 2023, does not have a contract with TSA 🤔, so I couldn’t use my KTN to get through security faster. 🤯 🤷\u200d♀️ Thus, I had to put this backpack in a security bin and remove my laptop, portable monitor, and Kindle.I asked if I could just unzip it all the way and lie it flat Like a clamshell, but the security agent kindly pointed out that when opened all the way, this backpack extends beyond the boundaries of the (quite large) security bin, so he said I indeed had to remove all my electronics.I don’t know if every agent would've said that, but that was my experience this time.I do understand that to include the upgrades listed here that I’d like to see, it would cost a lot more for this backpack. So, for the money, I’m pretty satisfied with this purchase, especially because it has a TON of room and double zippers that accept luggage locks for all the outer compartments. (My Lug bag, while much more stylish, has zippers that do not accept luggage locks; the holes in the zipper pulls are way too small! 😥)Given that this backpack has no other anti-theft technology, I’ll probably be investing in a PacSafe bag next. HOWEVER, this backpack has worked out very well for functionality.I got it just a couple of days before my trip, so it really helped me out in a pinch. If you’re on a budget and/or need it super fast, then this is a great choice!Btw, my weight limit was 10kg, and this could’ve held a lot more than that. However, I’m not strong enough to carry around that much weight all day. So bigger isn’t always better.After arriving at my destination and unpacking, I used this backpack for grocery shopping in areas that have public transit and we didn’t rent a car. This backpack was perfect for that! Just make sure to still put most food items, such as dairy, sugary items, sauces, powders/flour, and anything else that would be difficult to clean into plastic grocery bags before putting them into your backpack. This way, in case anything leaks, your investment will be protected and you won’t smell gross for the rest of your trip!I really do recommend this backpack if you need something fast, need a 10 kg bag for travel to the UK and want to maximize your cubic inches of space, after winning to purchase a separate, very cushioning laptop sleeve, want to make it fast and easy to remove your electronics at security if needed, and/or you’re on a budget.If you can afford to spend $50+ more, you might want to look elsewhere."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States July 10, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Good quality', 'author': 'Karen M.', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I absolutely love this back pack.

I\'ve been using this bag about a month now on daily subway travel, and while I\'m happy with it, I know it probably won\'t be a have-it-forever bag, which is fine by me. I\'ve never had a subway commute before, so I just wanted to get a sense of whether I liked using a backpack or whether I needed to invest in a better shoulder bag, and for that, this fits the bill.I\'m a woman of fairly small stature, 5\'2 and petite all around, so I didn\'t want to feel like I was back in my middle school days with a backpack that made me look like an ersatz turtle clomping down the street. I wanted something fairly professional, slim, and with a little bit of something, not just another black backpack. And obviously, for a trial run, I didn\'t want to spend a lot.This bag in the blue color fit the bill. It\'s a very nice neutral blue, like a pair of jeans, so it goes with nearly everything. It doesn\'t appear to be showing dirt or grime yet, which is nice. The zippers are fairly high quality considering; I haven\'t had any issues with them sticking or getting jammed. The fabric appears to be a decent quality nylon and is fairly water resistant. I wouldn\'t call it waterproof, nor would I trust my computer in there in a heavy rainstorm without an umbrella or putting it under a jacket, but for a drizzle or minor shower everything inside has stayed dry.The lining is cheap nylon. Full stop. It will tear in time. But it\'s nicely designed, with an integrated front pocket big enough for a large-ish smart phone, car keys, metro card, chapstick, and a few other sundries without a problem. It\'s a deep pocket with a shallower ""shelf"" pocket, which is nice to keep the smaller things accessible. The main compartment is roomier than you\'d think, even with a 15 inch laptop inside. The laptop compartment is not very well padded, kind of not padded at all almost, but it\'s roomy. There are also two smaller pockets along the front of the main compartment, big enough for a cell phone, pens, that sort of stuff. And then the deep well easily fits a small umbrella, a Tupperware for lunch, a large-ish water bottle, and a large wallet, even with a laptop inside. I can also cram a packable rain jacket in there without trouble, though it starts to look kind of stuffed at that point.Don\'t labor under any delusions that this thing is going to magically distribute weight or anything like that. It won\'t. You are carrying your load on your shoulders. It\'s not super well padded, it\'s not super breathable. If you\'re looking for a bag that\'s going to be at your side 24/7 around the country or around the world, and be waterproof and super protective of all your stuff and be near weightless on your back and have 7000 pockets for all your little odds and ends, this ain\'t it. My husband is appalled at this bag, because his backpack has those 7000 dedicated pockets for odds and ends and he can\'t fathom life without that level of organization. And maybe my ""forever bag"" will have that. But for a cheap backpack for once in a while use, or the casual commuter, or someone who just wants to feel out using a backpack as a work bag rather than a more traditional shoulder bag, this is a great buy.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States November 18, 2019', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Second Purchase', 'author': 'Adolph Dixon', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I purchase this backpack almost two years ago.

Dragu', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""Alright folks, buckle up 'cause I've got to tell you all about this fantastic backpack I bought last year. Honestly, it's been my trusty sidekick ever since, and I can't imagine life without it now! Let me give you the lowdown on why this backpack is the real MVP.First things first, I love how slim this backpack is. I mean, I'm always guilty of overstuffing my bags with random stuff I don't need (guilty as charged!). But this backpack has been like my personal Marie Kondo, helping me declutter and carry only the essentials. And you know what? It's been a game-changer.Now, I've been taking this backpack with me on all my travels, and it's been an absolute dream. Flying with it is a walk in the park 'cause it's small enough that TSA never gives me any grief, and it fits snugly under the seat in front of me. No more awkwardly trying to shove an oversized bag into the overhead compartment, thank goodness!One thing I really appreciate about this backpack is how comfy it is to carry around all day. I've had my fair share of bags that left my shoulders and back aching by the end of the day, but not this one! It's like the backpack equivalent of a cozy hug, I'm telling ya!Now let's talk pockets. You know how some bags have a gazillion compartments and you can never find what you're looking for? Well, not with this backpack! It's got just the right amount of pockets, making it super easy to find everything I need. No more endless searching for that one pen or my headphones. It's like the backpack gods finally heard my prayers!There is just one teeny-tiny downside to this otherwise perfect bag. If you're like me and sometimes can't help but cram too much stuff in there, you might risk tearing the threads in the main compartment at the top. But I've learned my lesson and started being more mindful about what I pack. So really, it's more on me than the bag itself, right?In conclusion, considering the price, this backpack is hands down the best one I've ever had the pleasure of owning. It's stylish, slim, comfy, and easy to use – everything I could ask for in a backpack! So if you're on the hunt for the perfect backpack for your daily grind or your globetrotting adventures, look no further. This is the one, my friends! Trust me, you won't regret it!Here's a poem I wrote just for this:There once was a backpack, so slim and so fine,It changed how I traveled and made my days shine,I bought it last year, and it's now my best friend,Helping me carry my stuff 'round the bend.Its slimness, a blessing, I've come to embrace,No longer weighed down by stuff, I feel grace,It's been on my back on adventures afar,And breezing through TSA, we've raised the bar!This backpack of mine, it's a snug little hug,Comfort all day, no more shoulders to shrug,It's got just the pockets I need, oh so nifty,Finding my things now, so easy and swift-y!But listen up, folks, there's a lesson I've learned,From stuffing it full, some threads I have churned,So be mindful, dear friends, of what you pack in,Too much and you'll find, that it's quite a sin.For the price, it's a steal, this bag oh so grand,The best backpack ever, in all of the land,So if you need something slim, comfy, and fun,Look no further, my friend, this bag's the home run!Humor and rhyme, in this tale of my sack,Trust me, you'll love it, it's got your back!"", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States April 17, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect, Compact, Inconspicuous looking backpack', 'author': 'Burvy', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'This backpack fits all of my stuff in it perfectly, and no space looks wasted.

This bag can fit the a6700 with a lens attached and several accessories. Note that it will not fit a full frame camera with a lens attached in any orientation, though one will fit without a lens attached and the lens stored next to it.Shown in the pictures are my primary kit of the a6700 with the 24mm f2.8G attached and the 50mm f1.8 OSS. Beneath the divider shelf is a Peak Design Slide strap. It will even fit the camera with the 70-350 G attached. Not shown are the microfiber cloth, UV filter, and spare SD card in the interior zippered pocket. Closing the bag was difficult at first, but the material stretched slightly after leaving everything in the bag overnight and now it is a perfect fit.My only minor complaint is that the strap was not removable and also not easily adjustable. Since my use case was to have a bag I could grab and throw in the car or carry as a sling bag, I decided to cut off the strap and add the Peak Design anchors. This way I can use the Slide strap to either carry the bag and quickly adjust it to fit, or use the strap on the camera based on my needs at the moment.Materials are pretty good and fit and finish is good.

The belt attachment that comes with the bag fits me, even though I\'m a big guy (6\'4"" and 365lbs).I don\'t often travel with this much gear, but I have an out of state wedding I\'m going to be photographing in April and I needed a bag that fits extra gear, and can be taken as a carry on. Overall, VERY impressed with this new bag. This is also my first purchase of a Ulanzi product, so I\'ll have to check some of their other stuff out now as well.

So the depth of where you will put your camera and lenses could be deeper if it wasn't split into 2 compartments but you actually don't have that much as you would think. I am using small/medium lenses in my photos. Something like a 24-105 would not be flush with the main compartment. (But you could still zip it up)I thought I could live with the PU leather, but if you are like me and throw your bag around then I do not think the material will last.What I hate the most about this bag is that you have to open it face down backup so that means the front is on whatever the ground surface is. I wish there was at least another hard cover on the other front pouch to take the damage and force , but since there isn't I can see the front bottom pouch getting shredded over time.Also the fact you have to open the main compartment with the front down mean you have to keep zipping it up to then flip back around to get to the front pockets. This bag slowed me down on a recent shoot a lotlIf you swing the backpack around to the front to grab the camera on one of the side zippers that go to the main compartment the camera will be upside down because of that reason that it has to open face down.I love the included waist strap that you can attach or take off. I had to tuck the clip straps underneath the pockets since I did not want it dangling and honestly it works great. Not sure if it was designed for that.I can recommend this if you don't think you will abuse your backpack, but I am so run and gun the backpack will get pushed to it's limits though I think $150 is a bit high."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 20, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': 'se ve muy bien', 'author': 'javier', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'apenas la usare pero se ve de muy buena calidad, estaba buscanbdo una mochila asi desde hace tiempo y otras de 2500 o menos se rompian facil por el peso que cargo en la mochila pero esta s eve que resistira mucho y es muy amplia', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in Mexico January 5, 2024', 'is_verified': True}]"

I never right a review on a product/purchase until I've used it or have have it for at least a month. Obviously if it's awful or cheap, I write one sooner. Everything is typically great when its new. I want to know how a product holds up over time and such. I think its a more honest review that way. So here we go:I'm thrilled that I found this back pack! I had been looking around for a while. I even returned two prior to finding this one. I carry a back pack every where with me, that's why I'm so anal when it comes to selection. This one arches back a bit which allows it to actually open up when it's unzipped. I think that's also why it hasnt bent a single notebook, file, binder, etc.The front zipper pocket is amazingly deep and surprisingly it doesn't look bulky when I'm in a hurry and just shove 50 things inside of it.The zippers haven't given me a single issue, which is impressive.My son accidentally knocked a cup of juice off the table and all over it... I carry my Samsung tablet inside one of the pockets in the main pouch.. well I kid you not when i say that the inside of this bag never got wet. Yes it was zipped up but the juice was all over the bag! The front, top, sides, down the back and the straps. Cleaning juice off this bag was a fricken breeze y'all! I didnt have to run it through the washer, nor dryer. Just a quick wipe down with a wet rag and dabbed it with a dry one... still looks and feels brand new. The quality alone is worth the money. Soft, silky material. Again, no issues with any zipper and the bag itself is surprisingly much larger then i had expected.The only con with this bag is in the name. This is suppose to be a laptop back pack but I would not carry mine around in this bag. Nit unless i wrap it in bubble wrap first.. there's not enough padding or protection. It only provides half the protection and support for a laptop compared to others that I've come across.Over all this bag is definitely worth the price. Great quality and material. Very durable and stable. Water proof and super easy to clean. Large inside. Many pockets, all which are nice and deep. Zippers are superb, mine have never jammed or snagged.

Prior to this back ive used a couple JanSport bags, and a Hiking bag.Ill try to get back with edits if anything changes.Pockets:Inside the main bag compartment there is a nice pocket that perfectly fits my 13 in Razer Blade Stealth inside a neoprene sleeve. This compartment is well padded, making me confident that my laptop will be protected from the contents in the main compartment.Right above that is a smaller zipper pocket that fits my laptop charger perfectly, This pocket is not padded.The main compartment has two more small open pockets, these are unpadded and have no zipper. This means that any of your items in this pocket can potentially fall out if you toss your bag around. I personally don't keep much in these pockets that can be damaged.The smaller compartment is nice and wide, usually i keep some small flash drives and my mouse in here. Again this is not padded so i don't put anything that can be damaged in here.Finally, on the outside of the bag you will get two side pockets with some velcro to keep them shut need be. I usually just throw an energy drink or bottled water on the go.Comfort:This bag has some pretty thin bag straps. This is fine for short durations, however for longer durations or with more things in my bag, it can start to get pretty uncomfortable quickly. I would have liked this bag to have slightly wider and softer straps. However for the price, this is not a bad trade-off.Aesthetic:This bag is plain. That is in no way an understatement. Its an all black bag with no accents or logo tags. When you open the bag, the inside has some light grey, which actually helps me find things on the bottom with less light.Price:If you need a bag that will do its job on the cheap then this is an amazing product. I personally have no issue saving some money and dealing with the shoulder straps. For the $12, this is the best price to performance bag i've personally used.Final Thoughts/Summary:The straps are a bit uncomfortable, however i would still get this over a JanSport for one main reason, this bag has some of the most useful pockets for in the main compartment for my needs. I would easily feel comfortable paying another $8 for this same bag and feel like i got a great deal. If you carry a good amount of heavy books then i would look for something with more padded shoulder straps, however if you are just moving from class to class, or in my case office to car to apartment, then i would wholeheartedly recommend this.Edit 1: I was wrong.

I am extremely particular about my backpack. My favorite backpack died a few months ago and I have been desperately seeking a good replacement. I cycle to and from work every day for 18 mi and have gone through about 6 amazon backpacks in the last 3 months. Like Goldilocks, I\'m 4\' 11"" woman and size matters. 1 was too big (30 L), one was too small (15L barely carried my sneakers), some were too heavy (waterproof wet bag), some had too many stupid pockets (freeknight, who needs a helmet net??), one was super lightweight and a decent 20L but the straps aren\'t padded enough and cut into my shoulders when I had too much stuff in it (New Outlander). But this Amazon Basics one is just right. It\'s so simple really. Roomy, good depth and width, carries all of my gym clothes, shoes, laptop and room to spare, padded inside pocket, small zippered internal pocket for important stuff, huge front pocket for random stuff, 2 sizeable side pockets for easy access to key/cards/cell phone with velcro to close (genius)! So few backpacks have velcro on the side pockets. It\'s either wide open and easy for stuff to fall out, or zippered which makes it not-so-easy to access. The color is SOOOO pretty! I love this vibrant baby blue!! It\'s so comfortable to bike with it!! I put it on and it felt just right!!! Seriously, for $15, I want to get 10 of them in every color and store them in the basement, just in case they get discontinued in 2020. I want to buy one for all my friends and family members. I want to wear it out on a hot date. I want to... oh you get the picture. Construction looks great and hopefully it lasts a year. I sprayed the entire backpack with Granger\'s waterproofing spray and tested it in the shower and water rolls right off of it. Now it\'s an even awesomer water-resistant backpack.

This fits both of those requirements. Fully stuffed with a week's worth of clothes is as big as a carry-on suitcase. Keep it about 3/4th full, and it will slide under your seat.It appears to be decent manufacturing quality with decent materials. There is a good amount of thickness and padding. The Stitching seems good. I don't think it's up for daily heavy use, but it seems durable for someone like me who's only gonna dust this off for the short trips 8-10 times a year.There's no unsightly logo on the one I received, and it looks pretty slick. I'll definitely feel cooler walking around an airport with this than my dirty, 20 year-old Jansport that I've bee using since college.The design is excellent and practical. I like that it has 1 very large compartment with a small slot in it that you can slide a laptop or tablet into if you want, or not, and it doesn't waste space if you don't use it. The large compartment has some bands to help keep different clothes separate. Nice feature. I really like that the main focus was for clothes.The other compartment for pens and non-clothing items is a good space saving size. The only thing I'll ding it on the design is that the zipper of the large compartment is kinda awkward being on the back, and not the side. This means you'll have to set the backpack on it's face, and if it's not lying flat, it might be a little annoying, but I think the trade off for the price of this for what you get it's not a big enough deal to matter much.Obviously if you're fine with spending like $100 on a backpack for more durability, go for it. This is probably not the right choice if you're gonna be using it all the time.

I question how long the plastic buckles will last, but no issues yet.- No top pocket for sunglasses like the Rush.- The conceal carry pocket has an elastic strap to attach a holster as desired, whereas the Rush is soft loop Velcro lines, so the Rush gives a lot more flexibility on how to mount a holster.- The straps would be more comfortable if they were set wider apart, but the Rush is pretty similar in this regard.- Upper small pocket has no internal dividers to help organize what you put in there.- This does not have a buckles to mount an optional waist belt strap like the Rush."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 22, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Folded for shipping - ruins it', 'author': 'Jesus is returning soon!', 'rating': 4, 'content': ""The backpack itself is great.

This bag can fit the a6700 with a lens attached and several accessories. Note that it will not fit a full frame camera with a lens attached in any orientation, though one will fit without a lens attached and the lens stored next to it.Shown in the pictures are my primary kit of the a6700 with the 24mm f2.8G attached and the 50mm f1.8 OSS. Beneath the divider shelf is a Peak Design Slide strap. It will even fit the camera with the 70-350 G attached. Not shown are the microfiber cloth, UV filter, and spare SD card in the interior zippered pocket. Closing the bag was difficult at first, but the material stretched slightly after leaving everything in the bag overnight and now it is a perfect fit.My only minor complaint is that the strap was not removable and also not easily adjustable. Since my use case was to have a bag I could grab and throw in the car or carry as a sling bag, I decided to cut off the strap and add the Peak Design anchors. This way I can use the Slide strap to either carry the bag and quickly adjust it to fit, or use the strap on the camera based on my needs at the moment.Materials are pretty good and fit and finish is good.

Highly Recommended!Pros:- High Quality Material and sturdy construction, bottom has an extra strong rubber like material.- Side Pocket holds my large 32 oz Water bottle- Other Side Pocket provides immediate access to camera.- Plenty of little pockets to fit basically everything you need- Lots of space and customizable dividers for equipment- Very comfortable to wear, for hours, even if packed to the brim.- PriceCons:- There isn't really much bad to say about this backpack, other than the fact, that the front Pocket could be a little bigger and hold more volume for a Tech pouch etc. But it works great for a Lightweight Jacket and iPad."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 13, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great all in one backpack for $100?!', 'author': 'Bam3vO', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""Again, tried many camera backpacks, this is the only one that had everything I need and more.

Good padding and protection and great use of space and accessibility. Zippers work smooth with little snagging. Main backpack compartment is nicely padded and organized for you, I didn't have to rearrange anything. My only issue is that the backpack main compartment has an anti falling velcro strap, Ulanzi should've added a way to cover Velcro on strap when not inuse. I found that when your close the bag, it will find Velcro on to something when trying to reopen the compartment. I used a double sided loop Velcro on the each end of the strap to keep it from flopping around and accidentally sticking to the inner lining.

The interior dividers should be more adjustable and also have more padding where it counts. Oh, the exterior also came pre-scuffed. Most of it wiped off, but the bit of the scuff that remained and the quality of the material seems like it will get scuffed and dirty more easily than the high dollar competition.

So the depth of where you will put your camera and lenses could be deeper if it wasn't split into 2 compartments but you actually don't have that much as you would think. I am using small/medium lenses in my photos. Something like a 24-105 would not be flush with the main compartment. (But you could still zip it up)I thought I could live with the PU leather, but if you are like me and throw your bag around then I do not think the material will last.What I hate the most about this bag is that you have to open it face down backup so that means the front is on whatever the ground surface is. I wish there was at least another hard cover on the other front pouch to take the damage and force , but since there isn't I can see the front bottom pouch getting shredded over time.Also the fact you have to open the main compartment with the front down mean you have to keep zipping it up to then flip back around to get to the front pockets. This bag slowed me down on a recent shoot a lotlIf you swing the backpack around to the front to grab the camera on one of the side zippers that go to the main compartment the camera will be upside down because of that reason that it has to open face down.I love the included waist strap that you can attach or take off. I had to tuck the clip straps underneath the pockets since I did not want it dangling and honestly it works great.

I’m also disabled and chronically ill. Ergo, my bag has to carry a LOT of stuff — spare masks, medication, powdered electrolytes, camera lenses, water bottles, snacks, textbooks, art supplies, noise canceling headphones, spare film, DnD stuff, and other items. Sometimes my folding cane as well. So I wanted a school bag that didn’t feel like a freshman backpack that could store the kitchen sink.I ended up ordering two bags, one of these and one from a different brand. Despite being a little cheaper than the other brand, the quality is MUCH higher on this bag. I love it. It’s incredibly sturdy and stain resistant (getting it in navy blue didn’t hurt in that regard). There’s a gazillion pockets so everything has a home. I use the little zipper bag for little odds and ends I need easy access to like Liquid IV, emergency meds, antibacterial wipes, microfibers, etc. In spite of everything I shove in there, there’s still enough room for my binders, textbooks, laptop, etc. When I’m all loaded down and carrying on both shoulders, the weight distribution is comfortable and even, and it doesn’t interfere with me using my cane.It’s also just a beautiful bag. I really like the design choices. There’s an internal bar in the top of the backpack underneath the zipper to help keep its form. It opens like a coin purse and makes loading and unloading very easy. The details are well designed and implemented. I think others have had zipper issues but I have not.The big front flap does not have a zipper. It’s just the flap down holding it in place. I imagine it would be very easy for someone to reach in and steal from you. I am not in crowds or other environments that invite pickpockets, so this isn’t an issue for me. Also there’s a zippered pocket under the straps (protected by your back when you’re carrying it) for cash/cards, but I think it would be very uncomfortable to carry your entire wallet in there.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 7, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars The Bag Is Amazing -- The Clutch, not so much', 'author': 'Emma', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'This bag is better than the product photos... Legit, gorgeous product. Mine came packaged in a bag with a little luxury-kind of drawstring bag. It was cute!As a smaller woman (I\'m 5\'1"") this backpack is the perfect size for my back. It doesn\'t feel bulky or look comically large on me. The fabric combination feels pretty good, no complaints there. It has a ton of pockets.... I don\'t know why I need this many pockets but hopefully it prevents the graveyard of junk that ends up at the bottom of all my bags. One fun pocket is right where the bag rests against your back (probably a great spot for a wallet or valuable stuff when traveling so you dont have someone stealing stuff). Great security feature.This would easily fit a 15"" laptop. In the picture I have my 13"" macbook pro in the back pocket (still has room to move it around) and my 6.8"" kindle signature in the next pocket. This is going to be my teacher school year bag....! Later on, I will update with how durable it is. At work, I have a 15 inch Dell so I will test that some other time.I like how there is no flip top over the top of the bag to make access easier. I had a similar bag to this that I always struggled with the flip top to access items inside.The small clutch that comes with it is the only thing I really don\'t care for -- It might be good for a small makeup holder, maybe a first aid kit/feminine hygiene kit, potentially diabetic supplies; but, in comparison to the bag, it\'s just feels like an after thought. It\'s not as nice looking or feeling. I don\'t like the mesh and elastic bands. I think the zipper pull on it is pretty though, it compliments the bag.

You definitely do not want to force that zipper closed, so you have to make sure it's not stuffed too full prior to zipping shut.Experiment prior to your trip, with all of the things that you want to transport in it to be sure you are not over stuffing it. :) Other than that, it's a beautiful favorite of mine."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 10, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent spacious backpack', 'author': 'AN', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'As advertised in pictures and described by other reviewers.

By comparison, this one is obviously much better (a low bar, but I do like it overall). The biggest issue is the laptop compartment itself, though - it fits my large laptop fine, and it does fit fairly snugly in the sleeve, making it easy to carry around with you, however the sleeve itself feels kinda flimsy, and it just barely fits around the top, too, so I\'d be a lot more worried about damaging it if it got dropped wrong, than I have been with some other laptop travel backpacks I\'ve used (sadly, my favorite one doesn\'t quite fit the new, slightly larger than 17.1 inch screen laptops they\'re making these days). Still better than nothing, though, obviously, and it\'d be fine on a plane, I\'m just a little more cautious when I get to the hotel and haven\'t unpacked yet. It\'s padded, just not *very* padded (and no padding for the top). Unfortunately, I didn\'t really see any that were much *more* padded, either. (At least none that still fit large laptops like mine - and this one does, if barely.)In terms of space, though, overall this wins. I do miss how my previous backpack had two decent sized ""primary"" compartments, the one with the laptop compartment, and another separate one, that were both pretty big. This one has the laptop compartment that\'s exactly the right size for a laptop, then one enormous compartment, and two much smaller ones. That\'s a pretty minor complaint, though. The smallest compartment has a pouch for a tablet (or just two separated spaces for your small items), the second, slightly larger smaller compartment has a bunch more separated small pouches inside (including one with an internal zipper). then the main compartment accordions out a big, so it can fit a decent sized package, or more clothing than you\'d expect from a backpack this size. But I\'ve also flown with it and not had a problem getting it under the seat. (Only the main compartment is particularly useful for filling with clothes, though. The other two are clearly designed more for pills, keys, paperbacks, small electronics, etc.)There are also two small zippered pockets on the side, and a third on the top. The one on the top contains a *removable* hard internal pouch for holding a pair of sunglasses - I was actually going to complain about it (it gets in the way, if you aren\'t using the space for sunglasses)... until I looked at it again just now, and yeah, completely removeable. (I use it for coins and things, since it\'s the easiest to access.) Each side also has a small outer mesh pouch, which looks like you\'d use it for holding things like water bottles, but I can\'t stress enough, they aren\'t large enough for full-sized water bottles to fit comfortably without falling out - my only other real complaint about the backpack. The main compartment does also have a space for plugging in a usb power bank (it doesn\'t *contain* one, you can just plug one in.) Then you can plug your own usb cable into the outside, and charge a phone that way. It\'s kind of a neat feature, though I don\'t really use it much. Works fine, though.It does fit comfortably on my back, with a decent amount of padding - we finally went on the Alaska cruise we booked in 2019, a couple months ago, I took it all over Alaska for a couple weeks, I can say, it\'s a lot more comfortable than my previous backpack. Feels a lot sturdier, too, though I haven\'t had it for a terribly long time, yet. I just wish I could find one like this, just slightly more padding for the laptop pouch.

This bag can fit the a6700 with a lens attached and several accessories.

Closing the bag was difficult at first, but the material stretched slightly after leaving everything in the bag overnight and now it is a perfect fit.My only minor complaint is that the strap was not removable and also not easily adjustable. Since my use case was to have a bag I could grab and throw in the car or carry as a sling bag, I decided to cut off the strap and add the Peak Design anchors. This way I can use the Slide strap to either carry the bag and quickly adjust it to fit, or use the strap on the camera based on my needs at the moment.Materials are pretty good and fit and finish is good.

I wish there was at least another hard cover on the other front pouch to take the damage and force , but since there isn't I can see the front bottom pouch getting shredded over time.Also the fact you have to open the main compartment with the front down mean you have to keep zipping it up to then flip back around to get to the front pockets. This bag slowed me down on a recent shoot a lotlIf you swing the backpack around to the front to grab the camera on one of the side zippers that go to the main compartment the camera will be upside down because of that reason that it has to open face down.I love the included waist strap that you can attach or take off.

I’m also disabled and chronically ill. Ergo, my bag has to carry a LOT of stuff — spare masks, medication, powdered electrolytes, camera lenses, water bottles, snacks, textbooks, art supplies, noise canceling headphones, spare film, DnD stuff, and other items. Sometimes my folding cane as well. So I wanted a school bag that didn’t feel like a freshman backpack that could store the kitchen sink.I ended up ordering two bags, one of these and one from a different brand. Despite being a little cheaper than the other brand, the quality is MUCH higher on this bag. I love it. It’s incredibly sturdy and stain resistant (getting it in navy blue didn’t hurt in that regard). There’s a gazillion pockets so everything has a home. I use the little zipper bag for little odds and ends I need easy access to like Liquid IV, emergency meds, antibacterial wipes, microfibers, etc. In spite of everything I shove in there, there’s still enough room for my binders, textbooks, laptop, etc. When I’m all loaded down and carrying on both shoulders, the weight distribution is comfortable and even, and it doesn’t interfere with me using my cane.It’s also just a beautiful bag. I really like the design choices. There’s an internal bar in the top of the backpack underneath the zipper to help keep its form. It opens like a coin purse and makes loading and unloading very easy. The details are well designed and implemented. I think others have had zipper issues but I have not.The big front flap does not have a zipper. It’s just the flap down holding it in place. I imagine it would be very easy for someone to reach in and steal from you. I am not in crowds or other environments that invite pickpockets, so this isn’t an issue for me. Also there’s a zippered pocket under the straps (protected by your back when you’re carrying it) for cash/cards, but I think it would be very uncomfortable to carry your entire wallet in there.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 7, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars The Bag Is Amazing -- The Clutch, not so much', 'author': 'Emma', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'This bag is better than the product photos... Legit, gorgeous product. Mine came packaged in a bag with a little luxury-kind of drawstring bag. It was cute!As a smaller woman (I\'m 5\'1"") this backpack is the perfect size for my back. It doesn\'t feel bulky or look comically large on me. The fabric combination feels pretty good, no complaints there. It has a ton of pockets.... I don\'t know why I need this many pockets but hopefully it prevents the graveyard of junk that ends up at the bottom of all my bags. One fun pocket is right where the bag rests against your back (probably a great spot for a wallet or valuable stuff when traveling so you dont have someone stealing stuff). Great security feature.This would easily fit a 15"" laptop. In the picture I have my 13"" macbook pro in the back pocket (still has room to move it around) and my 6.8"" kindle signature in the next pocket. This is going to be my teacher school year bag....! Later on, I will update with how durable it is. At work, I have a 15 inch Dell so I will test that some other time.I like how there is no flip top over the top of the bag to make access easier. I had a similar bag to this that I always struggled with the flip top to access items inside.The small clutch that comes with it is the only thing I really don\'t care for -- It might be good for a small makeup holder, maybe a first aid kit/feminine hygiene kit, potentially diabetic supplies; but, in comparison to the bag, it\'s just feels like an after thought. It\'s not as nice looking or feeling. I don\'t like the mesh and elastic bands. I think the zipper pull on it is pretty though, it compliments the bag.

A second deeper zipper pocket could be used for a scarf, gloves, or small packed lunch.3. Inside PocketsGoing from the portion that sits against your back toward the outside, there\'s a small zipper compartment for a small wallet, iPods, or small items. Below it is a deep wide pocket that works well for tablets, 13"" laptops, and regular sized books. There\'s no elastic here, so whatever you put in will fit loosely and may bounce around a bit (your own laptop sleeve might be a good idea). The main compartment is good for a binder or two, a few small groceries, an extra layer of clothing, or something along those lines. There are two smallish pockets on the outmost layer, facing in: probably good for lip goo, mini hand sanitizer, ear buds, this sort of thing.This is exactly the pack I\'ve needed for running errands on mass transit or heading to a park, museum, or outdoor event.

It feels like it will hold up to a lot of abuse, including getting wet.-Many, many pockets. We counted 17, including the large main part. There is a pocket on the back that can hold your passport and wallet without fear of someone pickpocketing you.-There is a strap on the back that goes over the handle of your suitcase, so no need to carry it the whole while at the airport.-The straps have nice cushion, and are easily adjustable.-So. Much. Space! I can fit an entire weekend\'s worth of clothing and toiletries for myself in the main pocket. (Just for a little context, I\'m 5\'0"", and only wear leggings.)

Eliot', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I purchased this backpack specifically to use as a ""personal item"" for a domestic flight on an airline (Frontier) that charges for any type of bag other than personal items. I bought the size ""large,"" thinking that it was slightly under their size requirements for a personal item, so it should be good. I then proceeded to pack it full for my few-day trip. The airline now requires all personal items (at least out of Denver) to be placed into their sizing scale to ensure it will fit before allowing boarding. I managed to cram the bag into their mechanism, but it was not easy, so just be forewarned if you are one to like to stuff things full that you may struggle with this.Beyond the issue specific to this airline, the backpack itself was mostly great for traveling! It\'s water resistant, has lots of compartments/zippers/etc and has a padded back to provide some comfort while carrying. I particularly like the separate compartment for shoes, and although anything added here does take up space inside the interior of the bag, I like not having dirty shoes touching my clean clothing or getting electronics wet. I will say it\'s easy to pack this bag which is both a blessing and curse as I ended up having a pretty heavy bag to carry -- of course, that is the fault of the packer and not the bag itself.The small front zipper was great for keeping my phone and ID handy for showing as needed, and I appreciate the compression straps/clasps to help keep the pack as small as possible.I should also note that it would likely be a struggle to get this item under many airline seats (which is often the requirement for a personal item), even if it wasn\'t stuffed full. I didn\'t even try because there was plenty of overhead room, but another possible hiccup for travel.Although I\'ve only used this for one round trip, it seems as though it will hold up decently to use and hopefully, in the future, I won\'t have to put quite so much into it so it won\'t be as hefty a load to carry. For the price and ease of use, I\'d absolutely recommend and/or purchase again if needed in the future, but hoping this one will last awhile as I don\'t deal with a ton of airline traveling.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States June 12, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Tons of pockets and little compartments!

It also survived a round in my washing machine so, bonus points for that.I took some time to use this bag for a couple of months before writing any kind of review and it has passed what I considered enough trials and tribulations.There are a plethora of pockets to help organize your belongings and to facilitate access; there\'s even a ""waterproof"" one that helps provide peace of mind in the event you\'re worried something will leak. There\'s a ""secret"" pocket on the backside for important things you don\'t want people accessing easily. The only pockets I really have qualms with is the ""shoe"" compartment at the bottom, since it doesn\'t really provide extra space. It uses the same internal space as everything in the bag since the pocket juts inward rather than outward. And the second one is the water bottle pocket, because it doesn\'t expand very much and it\'s a bit shallow but it fits 16 oz water bottles nicely. A little more wary about 24 oz bottles.There exists an attachment on the bag where you can attach a cable to the inside of your bag and run it to the outside to help you charge your device on the go. They\'ve included a USB-A to USB-A cable, but as I said, it can be unhooked and replaced with whichever type of cable you need.This bag also has buckles to help keep all your stuff compact and from jostling around.This is a great, durable bag that has weathered carrying ALL of my belongings (clothes, toiletries, souvenirs, etc) for a 6 day trip to Hawaii and also survived being lugged around and stuffed after a week long excursion to Italy for the same purpose, in addition to other smaller trips I\'ve taken.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 2, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Great for Travel', 'author': 'KMH', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'I originally got this backpack with the intention of using it to my college classes, but it was a little too big for that.

The backpack fits the standard as a carry-on for Turkish Airlines and fits in the overhead compartment in all the charter/tour buses I was taking. I was able to fit my clunky Hokas and some bags of candy that I got in the Duty-Free shop in the bottom shoe compartment and the ""luggage"" mid-section of the bag had enough for two light changes of clothes that I put in a small pouch from my packing cube set. It also fit my sunglasses, regular glasses, and my quart bag which was full of my liquids. What shoes or if you put shoes in that bottom compartment determines how much space for clothes you have but I was happy with being able to carry two changes of clothes on a 23 hr+ travel day. I was also able to fit my MacBook Air and laptop case and Kindle with all my wires and chargers in the back laptop compartment. The two pockets in the front are surprisingly spacious. The wet pocket goes deep since it has no pockets and some snacks got lost in there because of how big it is, but it was nice that they fit - Don\'t forget about the snacks you chuck in there. I would recommend it if you are taking it on a quick overnight trip or as a carry-on bag complementing your full-size luggage for a longer trip. I had several long layovers and travel days and it was nice to have my stuff in a backpack instead of a rolling luggage. I have the white bag and I had that thing all over Europe and it didn\'t get dirty or anything I cannot spot clean.

By comparison, this one is obviously much better (a low bar, but I do like it overall). The biggest issue is the laptop compartment itself, though - it fits my large laptop fine, and it does fit fairly snugly in the sleeve, making it easy to carry around with you, however the sleeve itself feels kinda flimsy, and it just barely fits around the top, too, so I\'d be a lot more worried about damaging it if it got dropped wrong, than I have been with some other laptop travel backpacks I\'ve used (sadly, my favorite one doesn\'t quite fit the new, slightly larger than 17.1 inch screen laptops they\'re making these days). Still better than nothing, though, obviously, and it\'d be fine on a plane, I\'m just a little more cautious when I get to the hotel and haven\'t unpacked yet. It\'s padded, just not *very* padded (and no padding for the top). Unfortunately, I didn\'t really see any that were much *more* padded, either. (At least none that still fit large laptops like mine - and this one does, if barely.)In terms of space, though, overall this wins. I do miss how my previous backpack had two decent sized ""primary"" compartments, the one with the laptop compartment, and another separate one, that were both pretty big. This one has the laptop compartment that\'s exactly the right size for a laptop, then one enormous compartment, and two much smaller ones. That\'s a pretty minor complaint, though. The smallest compartment has a pouch for a tablet (or just two separated spaces for your small items), the second, slightly larger smaller compartment has a bunch more separated small pouches inside (including one with an internal zipper). then the main compartment accordions out a big, so it can fit a decent sized package, or more clothing than you\'d expect from a backpack this size. But I\'ve also flown with it and not had a problem getting it under the seat. (Only the main compartment is particularly useful for filling with clothes, though. The other two are clearly designed more for pills, keys, paperbacks, small electronics, etc.)There are also two small zippered pockets on the side, and a third on the top. The one on the top contains a *removable* hard internal pouch for holding a pair of sunglasses - I was actually going to complain about it (it gets in the way, if you aren\'t using the space for sunglasses)... until I looked at it again just now, and yeah, completely removeable. (I use it for coins and things, since it\'s the easiest to access.) Each side also has a small outer mesh pouch, which looks like you\'d use it for holding things like water bottles, but I can\'t stress enough, they aren\'t large enough for full-sized water bottles to fit comfortably without falling out - my only other real complaint about the backpack. The main compartment does also have a space for plugging in a usb power bank (it doesn\'t *contain* one, you can just plug one in.) Then you can plug your own usb cable into the outside, and charge a phone that way. It\'s kind of a neat feature, though I don\'t really use it much. Works fine, though.It does fit comfortably on my back, with a decent amount of padding - we finally went on the Alaska cruise we booked in 2019, a couple months ago, I took it all over Alaska for a couple weeks, I can say, it\'s a lot more comfortable than my previous backpack. Feels a lot sturdier, too, though I haven\'t had it for a terribly long time, yet. I just wish I could find one like this, just slightly more padding for the laptop pouch. Overall, I\'m happy with it, though - way happier than my previous one, though admittedly that\'s a low bar.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 21, 2022', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars So much room!', 'author': 'P.

All you simply need to do is purchase a portable charging bank, or use your existing one and plug it into the inside connection of the USB Charging Port (there is a pocket dedicated inside the backpack for this specifically). Then on the outside, you can plug in your USB charger cord and charge your phone throughout the day directly from your backpack. You can also place your phone inside your backpack and plug the provided 3mm headphone cord into your phone, then on the outside of your backpack you can plug in your headphones to the provided port and listen to music without having to hold your phone on you, this is especially nice if you are in a crowded area and do not want to risk theft of your device.The built in combination lock is a 3 digit combination style lock. It is built-in directly on the top of your backpack and is secured by placing your main compartment zippers into the lock. Once secured, it prevents that compartment from opening until you have unlocked it using the combination that you had programmed. The provided instructions are easy to follow for you to setup your own combination code. I have vigorously tested the lock, and it truly does seem to be really durable and would take a bit for your average thief to get into. It also gives you that 'deterrent' so that a thief won't even want to attempt to steal anything from your backpack because of the lock that is in place.In summary, if you are looking for a stylish and secured backpack to use for your business needs or for that typical college or even high school student, then look no further. This is definitely the option for you and at a price that most people can afford. I hope that this review will help someone with making their decision, I know that when I purchased this bag I had questions about the locking ability, storage, and the USB Port that the backpack had, so I am hoping I was able to answer someone else's questions prior to them making a purchase. I was not compensated at all for this review, I just really like this backpack and thought I could provide a good review to help other shoppers make the right choice on their next purchase."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 15, 2020', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Great bag for the price. Wish there was padding on the bottom.', 'author': 'Aaron L', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'Bag arrived quickly and exactly as described. I got the grey weave 15.6"" laptop backpack. It\'s exactly as pictured, Everything works as expected and it seems like a nice roomy bag, just wide enough to accommodate my 15.6"" gaming laptop with lots of room and pockets left for accessories, spare clothes, drinks, etc. The lock is functional, but won\'t protect against anyone determined enough with a (little) bit of time. The button to reset the code is easily accessible along the bottom edge of the lock. It\'s subtle, but anyone familiar with this style of lock would eventually figure out how to open it. It\'s good enough to protect from pickpockets or someone trying to get into your bag on the subway/bus. The USB headphone ports on the side are a nice touch, with a nice little length of both cords inside the bag to connect to your battery charger and audio source. There is a tiny pocket inside to store each of these cords (they do not detach).The only complaint I have so far (and thus a docked star) is the lack of padding on the very bottom. Like most laptop bags, the laptop pocket is basically a foam padding sandwich, with great padding on the front and back. I just wish there was also a bit of pad on the very bottom of the bag. A drop on any other side/face of the bag and it will provide great protection. I only worry that if I plopped the bag down hard enough on the bottom, I might ding the edge of my \'puter. It would probably be okay, but I just don\'t understand why all these bags lack a bit of padding on the bottom. I\'m thinking I will cut a bit of pool noodle to stuff in the very bottom of the laptop pocket just for peace of mind. This is a shortcoming of all these tech bags/sleeves, so it probably shouldn\'t prevent you from purchasing this bag.Overall, this bag is nicer than the $69 Targus brand bags for sale at Target and Walmart. You will not beat the features for the price, plus, it\'s not ugly black all the bags the stores carry. The combo of the lock and the USB/audio port access make this bag a fantastic buy for the money. It was $18 when I first put it in my cart. A few days later it went up to $28. I finally bought it this week when the price dropped back to $25. After looking at what Staple, Target, and Walmart had for laptop bags, this was the easy winner on price, looks, and features.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States June 5, 2020', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Your Perfect Travel Companion!', 'author': 'Adam Nelson', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""The Tzowla Travel Laptop Backpack has completely transformed the way I approach commuting and traveling.

There's some things that need improvement, but overall, it is great for a weekend trip or a a carry on for a longer trip.First, I wish there were more slots in the front pocket to hold smaller items in place, like a pen holder. Organization is key when traveling and they only offer one place inside to do this.There is a flat pocket on the inside with no zipper. This was a bit annoying when things would slide out while the backpack was open. Since this thing opens so much I think they shouldn't skimp on the zippers and making sure you're stuff stays in the place you put it.Second, the mesh pocket on the inside ripped along the stitching and stuff was going into the other pocket and escaping. The sewing needs to be better here.The small pocket on the outside is just barely big enough for a passport. I can fit my passport in there with the thick travel sleeve I bought for it, but other than that, it can't fit much.The shoe compartment is big and can get in the way when there are shoes in it. If you're flying, I suggest only bringing two pairs of shoes (the ones your wearing, and a pair of sandals to go inside the bag. The sandals will fit in there flat. But regular shoes well take up valuable real estate on the inside.)There are a few other compartments I haven't mentioned and that's because I barely used them. There is a large compartment in front that zips open to fit flat items like a book. Your laptop will be safely padded in this, and I didn't notice any poking from items inside my bag because there is such a good layer of cushion/ foam between you and the nearest compartment.The straps are thick and comfortable. No problems there.The wire to the charging port isn't as sturdy as one would hope. Be careful with it and don't pull on it too hard. There is no designated compartment for your battery pack.Overall, this is a great backpack and will take the place of my old bag that I have used to death. It's perfect for weekend trips, which is what I mostly need it for. My longer vacation was a great test.

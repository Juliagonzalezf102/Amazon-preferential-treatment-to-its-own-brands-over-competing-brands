I knew these weren\'t glass at this price, but the plastic they use is almost paper thin. It has enough shine and stiffness so it doesn\'t flex much so overall, the look is nice. The rear panel has hangers on length, or tall wise so you can arrange the frame on the wall they way you want. The back panel has these metal swivel type clips that hold the back panel into the black plastic frame. This part didn\'t work exactly perfect but it holds it plenty well enough. They are very light because they are made of plastic so are great for the kids room. Planning on putting these godzilla posters above the kids computer desk, so it\'s perfect. If they fall they won\'t shatter, or hurt anyone as they\'re pretty light weight. Overall a 5 for the price, and what i\'m using it for.

I don\'t normally write product reviews but these were game changers for me, so I\'d like to offer my thoughts in case anyone else frames often and is seeking a good quality, affordable option.I tried these out as framing options for my digital art. They are very sturdy and well-made for the price - much better constructed than something you\'d find at Michaels in a similar price-range. If you just want a cheap, quick framing option, these are perfect, at least for me. The hardware in back are all good quality. There are two sawtooth hangers that let you hang the piece in either orientation.They do NOT have glass - instead they use an acrylic sheet with film on either side that you peel off before setting into the frame. This keeps the cost low, but it also makes the frames MUCH lighter. This can be an advantage for several reasons - easier and possibly safer to hang, potentially easier or cheaper to ship, won\'t shatter if dropped, etc.I\'m not sure how easy the acrylic might be to scratch (I was very careful when I was peeling off the films and setting into the frames, just in case.) I was also very careful to not touch the acrylic with my fingers if I could help it, in case it left fingerprints that were difficult to wipe away. However, these are normal things you probably already do when working with frames.Other great pros:1. Zero or very little plastic residue from the frames (shavings, dust, etc.) Plastic frames will often have this, but these were very clean.2. Sturdily attached corners, no gaps at the edges. Other ""flimsy"" frames usually will break, chip, or separate here.3. No warping that I can see anywhere. Clean, straight edges all around.4. Simple smooth finish, sort of in-between glossy and matte. I ordered black frames, but these do come in several colors, which is awesome.5. Last but not least, these come in 8.5""x14"", which is a pretty non-standard and often difficult to find size! I REALLY appreciate this, as it\'s what I use for a specific series of art that I create. (Note: FYI, I\'m pretty sure not all colors are available in this size - only black.)Possible cons:1. The acrylic doesn\'t offer any glare resistance as far as I can tell. So depending on where you hang the art, that might be something to consider. That said, they don\'t appear to have any more glare than an average piece of untreated/gallery glass.2. Doesn\'t have a table-stand in back, so you\'re limited to hanging on the wall only.Bottom line: If you just want a very cheap frame for general purposes, or perhaps you are an artist or vendor that frames LOTS of prints or art pieces, these are an excellent low-cost option. I can buy a few packs of these and frame an entire series for a gallery showing, and everything looks perfectly fine AND weighs less to transport. I sincerely hope these frames stick around for good.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 4, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Good frames for a great price', 'author': 'Mike W', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""Okay, let‚Äôs get real for a sec.

You get exactly what you pay for, read the description carefully.The frame and everything else are made of plastic. This means they are lightweight and won\'t break if they fall. It also means they won\'t protect your art from UV damage like glass would, and I\'d rather not more plastic in the environment but I\'m on a fixed budget. So, there are pros and cons.The matte provided isn\'t a real art matte, it\'s just a piece of paper with a hole cut out. Nevertheless, it provides a simulation of the real thing. See my attached photo, with a flower I did in Derwent Inktense pencils for an idea.They were well packaged, and arrived intact. The back opens up easily, and they provide hangers. I have not used the hangers provided yet, so I can\'t provide feedback on them, but I hope they will work on drywall.I\'m poor and I wanted to frame a piece of art I did as an inspiration to do more art. These fit the bill perfectly.Update: I have now used the included plastic hangers. They work GREAT on drywall.I feel the need to address a few things I see in other reviews.The ""sticky"" sticker - there\'s a thin film of plastic on BOTH sides of the acrylic to protect it from scratches. If you remove this, like the instructions tell you 10x, the sticker comes off. With no residue. Lol.Now in her defense? The film is very thin, and I had trouble seeing it at first too. Go to a corner and drag a finger over it until it pulls off the plastic. Suddenly, the plastic is *much* clearer and brighter! Lol. Magic.The back feels too loose or too tight? Those clips are *adjustable*. They slide back and forth. Slide them back to remove the backing, and slide them forward after you put the clips in place.

I was looking for an inexpensive frame to replace damaged art in a high traffic area of our home.I purchased a 16x16 inch black frame with plexiglass glazing, and I\'m overall happy with this purchase. The frame was well packaged and arrived safely two days after I ordered (with Amazon Prime). The plexiglass had a layer of film on either side to keep it protected and then the frame had styrofoam and cardboard protectors on the corners, was wrapped in plastic, and packaged inside a thin layer of styrofoam in a fitted box. IMO just enough packaging to protect the frame without being excessive. The frame is pre-strung with hangers to orient it vertically or horizontally (kind of unnecessary in this case since the frame is square) and comes with a wire hanger and instructions to attach it. The hanging wire provided is a thicker/stiffer than needed for this application and longer than needed so you do need wire cutters to trim it to size, but it works.Assembling the frame and installing my art was easy. The plexiglass is thin and flexes easily so it needs a little guidance to get it to sit square in the frame rabbet. My plexiglass had a couple small (about 1/4 inch) scratches about 2 inches from the edge (visible before I removed the protective backing), so not perfect but not too large or in a place where it would be conspicuous. The frame itself is nicely assembled, with two ""staples"" joining each corner and the corners well aligned and flush. You can see a slight seam at two of the corners since the material itself is not black all the way through, but this is only upon examining closely and not noticeable from viewing distance (I didn\'t feel it required any touch up). I found the surface material of the frame to be nicely manufactured - no scratches, dings, bubbling, chips, or other imperfections. I believe the frame is sturdy enough to not warp over time, especially considering the overall light weight of the piece thanks to the plexi glazing.This is a cheap frame with thin plastic glazing. The materials are not archival, the glazing is not optical grade, and its less than $30 for the 16x16 size. For the price, I think it is a great option for inexpensively framing midsize art. If anything, I\'d like to see felt or rubberized bumpers added to the package so that the corners of the frame don\'t rest directly on the wall.The piece we wanted to frame was art that I had commissioned of our pup, and unfortunately the hanger supplied with the original frame failed and resulted in the piece falling to the ground, shattering the glass, breaking the frame, and scratching the original print. Because the art itself was damaged and I have the digital file to reprint it in the future if necessary, I didn\'t want to spend a lot of money on a replacement frame and wasn\'t very concerned about having a perfect optical surface, and this was perfect for safely getting our picture back on our walls. Since the art hangs near our front door and we have a dog and a baby on the way, I actually liked the idea of using plexi and not having to worry about a repeat crash and shatter incident.I think this is a great buy for the money for inexpensive art, and the five star rating I have provided is reflective of the price point and expectations I had for this item. If you have a high value or one of a kind piece you want to last a long time, invest in professional framing and use archival materials and quality UV protective optical glass or acrylic to protect your artwork. If you just want to hang some cheap prints on your walls without spending a ton of money, this is a great option.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 15, 2022', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Beautiful and big!

I recently stumbled upon these upsimples 8.5x11 Picture Frames, and boy, am I jazzed to share my thoughts! Now, I ain\'t no interior designer, but I\'ve got an eye for things that sparkle (both literally and metaphorically). And these frames? They\'re the bee\'s knees, the cat\'s pajamas, the... well, you get the idea.First off, let\'s talk about that High Definition Glass. I mean, I\'ve seen HD on my TV, but on a frame? Mind. Blown. ü§Ø I popped in my college diploma (yeah, I did the whole school thing, but don\'t let that fool you into thinking I\'m some kind of genius), and it was like I was seeing it for the first time. The colors popped, the text was crisp, and it made me feel like I\'d just graduated all over again. Minus the student loans, thank goodness.Now, I\'ve got a mishmash of stuff in my pad - some old family photos, a couple of concert tickets, and a doodle from my niece that she swears is a horse (looks more like a potato, but who am I to judge?). These frames were perfect for all of \'em. The sleek black design is like the little black dress of home decor - it goes with everything!And here\'s the kicker: you get FIVE of these bad boys in a pack. FIVE! That\'s like... one for every finger on one hand! Or, y\'know, five walls or tabletops. I went a bit wild and created a mini gallery wall in my living room. Every time my pals come over, they\'re like, ""Whoa, when did you get so fancy?"" And I just wink and point to my upsimples frames. üòâInstallation? A breeze. Whether you\'re a wall-hanger or a tabletop kind of person, these frames have got you covered. They come with these nifty little stands and hooks, so you can switch things up whenever the mood strikes. And trust me, the mood will strike. I\'ve already rearranged my frames three times this week. It\'s like a mini home makeover without the hefty price tag.But here\'s the cherry on top: they\'re sturdy. I\'m a bit of a klutz (okay, a lot of a klutz), and I may or may not have knocked one off the table while doing my victory dance (don\'t ask). But guess what? Not a scratch. The frame was in tip-top shape, and my diploma was safe and sound. Phew!In conclusion (yeah, I remember that word from my school days), if you\'re in the market for some top-notch frames that won\'t break the bank (or easily break at all), give these upsimples frames a whirl. They\'re stylish, durable, and they make everything look like a million bucks. Or at least, like you\'ve got your life together, which, let\'s be honest, is half the battle.Happy framing, folks!

The following is my review of these 3 11 x 14 frames:Selection: Impressive. So many mix and match options it‚Äôs almost dizzying. As others from Amazon told me, for my 8.5 x 11 photos the 11 x 14 is the better option than the 12 x 16 which states it is for 8.5x11 wirh Mat. Yes there is some of the photo around the edges that is not seen but to me that‚Äôs better than the backing of the frame being seen if or when the picture were to shift. Again great selection. Don‚Äôt be afraid of the 11x14 for 8.5x11 photos.Price: I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll get a better price deal, with any company, unless their quality drops in some way. Or you get them at a Prime event. That original $30 at Staples is not too car off for what the market is asking.Quality: This is where I couldn‚Äôt give that 5th star. From a distance they look great. And if I ever have a home invasion I‚Äôll wing one at the intruders like a chinese star with blades. The corners will cut off their heads. The plastic is so hard that the corners are really sharp and pointed. Do not place over anyone‚Äôs bed. In addition to the points of the corners where each side meets the other there is a bevel up or down, meaning it‚Äôs mot smooth on one of the three, the Liberty Bell frame. And lastly as I was unboxing and putting in the photos I noticed abrasion marks where some machine pushed so hard that it scratched the back portions of the frames. Please don‚Äôt misunderstand me. I believe quality checking does occur. I think it could be improved and you know I think something can be done about the corners were there so sharp. I know these things because on one of the Vikings there was a misaligned rivet or one red it fell out and they put in a new one so on the picture frame with the buildings and the lighter buildings there you can see a hole where the red it was had been and somebody did the quality control, checked and found out that there was missing one. The hole is along the bottom portion in the left-hand side. You can see it if you blow up the photo.So I say all these things because I saw somebody else mention quality, but he was talking more about the facts, and how the wall hanging portion those you know those little grabbers are not in the same position on every single frame, and I will have to look out for that myself so obviously there are some quality control issues but he didn‚Äôt really mention the same ones I found out so that‚Äôs a another thing, so are they worth lying? Yes, I don‚Äôt think and I don‚Äôt think I put them in a child‚Äôs room or anywhere they could accidentally fall off and hurt somebody. I‚Äôm not sending them back and I don‚Äôt want anything from the company. They are what they are, mass produced plastic frames.As comparison, because I like frames, the larger almost poster like photo with its frame was a custom made frame made by my local frame maker. She‚Äôd be disappointed in me for the 3 that I purchased. And I‚Äôd say to her‚Ä¶- Shhh. If you‚Äôre not paying for them, or giving me a better discount, then you get no say in this.

I knew the mat opening dimensions for these frames wouldn\'t be exactly what I\'d been looking for but they were soooooo very close, extremely affordable, and as you can see in my review photos, my art fits pretty well and the fact that my 8¬Ω""x5¬Ω"" art doesn\'t overlap the sides of the mat is barely noticeable. If it really bothered me, I could get or make another mat but I\'m fine with it the way it is. It definitely solved my dilemma of finding a frame. I wish I\'d found these before I spent many hours shopping around. It would\'ve saved me so much time. At least I saved money buying these. Now I just hope the price doesn\'t increase so I can afford to buy more as needed.Although it\'s probably obvious (LOL!), I would like to add that I AM NOT A PROFESSIONAL ARTIST. It\'s just a hobby for me but now that I\'ve discovered these frames, I may start giving some of my drawings a more professional look instead of keeping them hidden away in a binder. I may even make my own mats so I can use these 9""x12"" frames to frame multiple 4""x6"" or 3""x4"" printed photos.To wrap up my review... if you need affordable frames that look good, at just over $2 each you can\'t go wrong with these! If by chance you need or want glass panes instead of plexiglass, this company sells frames with shatterproof glass but at a higher price. You may even be able to get glass panes cut to fit somewhere like at a craft store that makes custom frames. In my honest opinion, these frames are VERY MUCH worth the price!

It\'s obviously not mahogany. It\'s a mahogany-print adhesive veneer on top of ... something that is probably pressboard or similar (I see it\'s called ""engineered wood"" in the description). I knew it going in and it\'s fine for what I needed.My requirements were:1. Look decent enough for a work certificate2. Real glass3. Not a plastic frame (i.e., cheap wood with a veneer is a-ok for me)4. Arrive unbrokenIt does look nice. Plenty nice enough for this certificate. The veneer is on the nicer end of quality fake wood grain. :) It doesn\'t have any texture but if I needed that I would\'ve paid a WHOLE lot more for a frame with some fancy stained wood. The sides are nice and flat and there are no bubbles in the veneer. Obviously I can\'t say how well that will hold up yet but it\'s enough for my purposes.It has real glass, not some plastic or acrylic layer.Packaging is very good. I seem to have consistent problems with anything fragile coming from Amazon arriving broken. The frame is sealed in shrinkwrap, surrounded on the corners with some quality plastic spacers, and boxed inside a well-fitting box. There were no visible marks anywhere on the frame and the glass was intact. If someone gouges the broad side of it, it\'ll break, but casual delivery abuse probably won\'t.It comes with a stand built into the back for desk use, a black nail hanger pre-attached, and a kit for hanging it by a wire. The wire kit includes a wire and two clips for attachment, and doesn\'t require any nails or staples, and mounts in a way that allows flush hanging on a wall.The back is attached by the usual basic bendable metal tabs one would find on an inexpensive frame.So if you\'re looking for an inexpensive frame that\'s still pretty good (did I mention real glass?), the ""mahogany"" frame with shatter-resistant is a great option at $13-$15 or so.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 18, 2022', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great frame', 'author': 'Traci M.', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Perfect for certification certificates.

The cardboard backing even feels stronger than some other frames I've had.The white frame part is clean and consistent in color and texture. It looks pretty professional including the cut matt board it comes with. Personally, i like the matt boards to have a bit more width to a bottom of a portrait or landscape to give a better illusion ever since I had a mentor point it out and some of the differences. However, the matt board is cut very well and there's no stickers or any dirt stuck to the board (I've had a board cut for me at a company who left the pricing stickers on the area that would have been displayed.) It's very clean, very nice. Nicely packaged. Great price for what you receive, I'm definitely going to buy from this company again.I don't know why people are complaining about the wire and clips you use to hang the frame... and I guess some people thought it was complicated... the package comes with a photo by photo directions clearly showing how and where to clip the metal clips to hang it. there's a piece of metal that has one side of a hole and right next to it is where you clip it to the cardboard backing... it's very simple, straightforward and easy.

For extra security, I added squares of duct tape to the back corners of the frame to provide extra stability because you can pull off the edges easily. Be sure to remove the protective film from each side of the plexiglass and work in a dust-free area because the plexiglass will attract dust.

S.', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'UPDATE: So glad I reordered the white frames. The replacements came in great condition; the corners were put together nicely and the distressing was done nicely. Still not a fan of the hangers but for the price and the fact that I wanted the gold ""distressed"" look I do like them.ORIGINAL REVIEW: I purchased two sets of frames, one in eggshell blue and one in white. I really like the eggshell blue! All the corners match up/come together nicely, the gold ""distressing"" is placed well, and the back closed nicely. They were nicely packaged and were not damaged. There was a lot of discussion about the blue color so I attached an up-close photo. The prop is sturdy and does not tilt the picture back too far. There\'s also a hanger that is removable/movable so you can hang from either direction. Here\'s my issue with the hanger though, and the reason for 4 stars. The hanger is not very substantial and I found it difficult to get the pictures to hang straight. Also the prop is so thick it was bringing the picture out far from the wall. I didn\'t want to cut the prop off in case I decided to use them differently down the road. I ended up finding the best way to hang them was to put the back on upside down so the bottom of the prop is at the top of the frame; it seemed to help them be tighter to the wall and made easier to get them straight.Now the white frames were a different story. I ordered Amazon\'s used product; it was reported that the only issue was that it would not come in original packaging but that the product itself was not damaged. This was not the case. The corners did not match up correctly so although they looked okay at a glance there was actually a gap at the mitered corners on both frames to the point light easily came through. Also the gold distressing wasn\'t as nicely done on the white frames I received. So I\'m taking a chance in returning the used product and purchasing the same frames new to see if another package will be better made as I have four pictures to put together and wanted the frames to be the same style but the two different colors to mix it up some. I will update my review after I receive them.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 27, 2020', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Would buy these again', 'author': 'VP', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Great product and look really good', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 23, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Good Quality', 'author': 'Lydia', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""These frames are good quality and were perfect for displaying my daughter's graduation picture and degree."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States November 10, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Looks Great', 'author': 'Amazon Customer', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Very nice quality frame.

I ordered several of the 11"" x 14"" frames for a project I was doing. They are very attractive for the money. However, the metal that comes with them to hang them on the wall SUCKS. It would be sufficient for a small, lightweight frame, like a 5"" x 7"", but not a heavier frame. I was hanging several 11"" x 14"" frames, which are heavier, and the little piece of metal is nowhere near close enough to hold the weight of a larger frame. They bend and the frame falls right off the wall. I\'m lucky I caught the frame and the glass didn\'t break. This is manufacturing 101.....how does quality control miss something like this?? So now I either have to pound in some sawtooth hangers into the back of the wood frame, which I really don\'t want to do, or I have to order Alien Tape, which costs another $20+ in order to hang all these frames.

S.', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'UPDATE: So glad I reordered the white frames. The replacements came in great condition; the corners were put together nicely and the distressing was done nicely. Still not a fan of the hangers but for the price and the fact that I wanted the gold ""distressed"" look I do like them.ORIGINAL REVIEW: I purchased two sets of frames, one in eggshell blue and one in white. I really like the eggshell blue! All the corners match up/come together nicely, the gold ""distressing"" is placed well, and the back closed nicely. They were nicely packaged and were not damaged. There was a lot of discussion about the blue color so I attached an up-close photo. The prop is sturdy and does not tilt the picture back too far. There\'s also a hanger that is removable/movable so you can hang from either direction. Here\'s my issue with the hanger though, and the reason for 4 stars. The hanger is not very substantial and I found it difficult to get the pictures to hang straight. Also the prop is so thick it was bringing the picture out far from the wall. I didn\'t want to cut the prop off in case I decided to use them differently down the road. I ended up finding the best way to hang them was to put the back on upside down so the bottom of the prop is at the top of the frame; it seemed to help them be tighter to the wall and made easier to get them straight.Now the white frames were a different story. I ordered Amazon\'s used product; it was reported that the only issue was that it would not come in original packaging but that the product itself was not damaged. This was not the case. The corners did not match up correctly so although they looked okay at a glance there was actually a gap at the mitered corners on both frames to the point light easily came through.

I ordered several of the 11"" x 14"" frames for a project I was doing. They are very attractive for the money. However, the metal that comes with them to hang them on the wall SUCKS. It would be sufficient for a small, lightweight frame, like a 5"" x 7"", but not a heavier frame. I was hanging several 11"" x 14"" frames, which are heavier, and the little piece of metal is nowhere near close enough to hold the weight of a larger frame. They bend and the frame falls right off the wall. I\'m lucky I caught the frame and the glass didn\'t break. This is manufacturing 101.....how does quality control miss something like this?? So now I either have to pound in some sawtooth hangers into the back of the wood frame, which I really don\'t want to do, or I have to order Alien Tape, which costs another $20+ in order to hang all these frames.

Unfortunately, to my disappointment there isn't much more in the film it self and you start wondering was it really worth getting this DVD which costed me not less than some 50 euros. This high cost for me is explained by the fact that Framed is available only for region 1 and with mailing cost I had to pay something like 20 euros to get it. As my present DVD player shows movies for region 2 only, I bought a new player which covers all regions there are. So I paid in total something like 50 euros.

Came with white gloss sheet in case you need a border for smalller pictures or puzzles. But if your picture or puzzle is smaller, you would have to adhere it to the border sheet to prevent it sliding down. In my case where I had an exact fit, this is what I did. On the rear of the frame, I bent the retaining tabs that hold everything into the frame vertically and removed everything from the frame. I then removed the backing from both sides of the transparent sheet, and placed it on top the puzzle, which was already on a piece of cardboard which I built it on. Putting the transparent sheet onto the puzzle first helps to stiffen the puzzle to slide it onto the backing sheet. (I discarded the white background sheet as I did not need a border) Then I slid the puzzle and transparent sheet over onto the backing sheet that came with the frame and lined up the edges. Next, I placed a spacer on the table (I used a banker\'s box cover which is about 2"" high, but you can use anything about that height), and placed the backing sheet, puzzle and transparent sheet on top of it, then rechecked that all edges are aligned. Then I put the frame over it carefully to avoid snagging the edges, and once it was completely seated over everything, I felt under along the edges and bent the tabs onto the backing sheet.

The frames come with two pre-mounted hangers, allowing you to easily hang them in either the portrait or landscape position, you only need to supply the nail.These frames are a beautiful complement to both neutral and natural type decor.Instead of the traditional frame-on-top-of-frame like my other floating frames, this one has a slot in one end the two pieces of glass slide into. Ultimately, I like this design better because the picture is less likely to slide around during insertion.The only issue I had with this frame which was a slight aggravation was that the glass was somewhat warped. This only makes it a little harder to fit the glass into the slot but does not affect the function or attractiveness of the frame. Once you have the glass inserted, the fit is snug enough that the glass lies flat.I plan to use the set in my living room but also feel these would make a wonderful gift for someone.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 11, 2023', 'is_verified': False}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars easy to use', 'author': 'Tin Julia', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'The quality is very good, the workmanship is fine, and it is exactly as described.

Unfortunately, to my disappointment there isn't much more in the film it self and you start wondering was it really worth getting this DVD which costed me not less than some 50 euros. This high cost for me is explained by the fact that Framed is available only for region 1 and with mailing cost I had to pay something like 20 euros to get it. As my present DVD player shows movies for region 2 only, I bought a new player which covers all regions there are. So I paid in total something like 50 euros. Now that I'm cooled down I'm not anymore so disappointed because I was able to watch Framed and I probably watch it again one of these days.

The Frame reminds me a lot of Tarkovsky\'s ""Stalker,"" which is a masterpiece from 1979. Not only does Winans (director of The Frame) do wonders with not just the fourth wall but with the frame as well (kudos to the editors), but brings the viewer into the frame in some very mind-blowing ways.

With little or no effort, I was able to easily achieve a very attractive and professional looking result. On the back of the frame are many metal latches to secure the back panel and apply pressure to the framed piece to hold it securely in place. The prop stand on the back completes the package, making for the perfect table-top or shelf display of your framed item. Alternatively, there are two wall hook receivers attached to the back for hanging in either ‚Äúportrait ‚Äú or ‚Äúlandscape ‚Äú orientation.

The Frame reminds me a lot of Tarkovsky\'s ""Stalker,"" which is a masterpiece from 1979. Not only does Winans (director of The Frame) do wonders with not just the fourth wall but with the frame as well (kudos to the editors), but brings the viewer into the frame in some very mind-blowing ways.

On the rear of the frame, I bent the retaining tabs that hold everything into the frame vertically and removed everything from the frame. I then removed the backing from both sides of the transparent sheet, and placed it on top the puzzle, which was already on a piece of cardboard which I built it on. Putting the transparent sheet onto the puzzle first helps to stiffen the puzzle to slide it onto the backing sheet. (I discarded the white background sheet as I did not need a border) Then I slid the puzzle and transparent sheet over onto the backing sheet that came with the frame and lined up the edges. Next, I placed a spacer on the table (I used a banker\'s box cover which is about 2"" high, but you can use anything about that height), and placed the backing sheet, puzzle and transparent sheet on top of it, then rechecked that all edges are aligned. Then I put the frame over it carefully to avoid snagging the edges, and once it was completely seated over everything, I felt under along the edges and bent the tabs onto the backing sheet.

The main elements are sturdy, connected with metal corner braces. The painted surfaces are all smooth, with consistent color. They look fine upon inspection, and they present well in an arrangement as a group.The backings are simple cardboard stock, but thick enough to provide the right amount of strength. You don\'t need more than this for the backings, and using thick cardboard allows the frames to remain lightweight. The metal holders for the backings are a bit tough to bend in and out.Be aware that the ""glass"" is plexiglass. At first, I doubted the use of this material. But it looks fine, cleans easily, avoids sharp edges you get with glass, reduces weight, and it keeps the cost down. I really don\'t think anyone can tell unless they scratch their fingers against it, and I don\'t think that\'s going to happen much! The biggest downside for me is that each plexiglass sheet is covered with protective wrap that I found a bit tedious to remove.These frames do not have the hangers installed upon delivery. There is a bag of two different types of hangers, which are very simple to add to the frames. But you do have to take that extra step with these frames.

Unfortunately, to my disappointment there isn't much more in the film it self and you start wondering was it really worth getting this DVD which costed me not less than some 50 euros. This high cost for me is explained by the fact that Framed is available only for region 1 and with mailing cost I had to pay something like 20 euros to get it. As my present DVD player shows movies for region 2 only, I bought a new player which covers all regions there are. So I paid in total something like 50 euros. Now that I'm cooled down I'm not anymore so disappointed because I was able to watch Framed and I probably watch it again one of these days.

One of my favorite purchases for my new home in making the space personalized and home for a really low cost yet still looks great!!

I measured the frame and it came out as 8"" x 8"", when I ordered a 10X10. Then I used my tape measure and saw that although the tape measure ""inches"" are divided into 1/8"" sections, the inch is actually 10/8 of an inch. Kind of funny and still worked for what I needed.) Note that the frame is 1"" in depth, so the picture will not hang tight to the wall. There is a slot at the top for the pieces of glass to slide into. The installation kit comes with little clips to hold the glass together. The kit also comes with some funky nails. As you tap them into the wall, the nail part slides further into the plastic piece. I used a dry erase marker on the backside of the glass to mark where the artwork needs to be placed. The kit comes with little glue droplets that were easy to place and use. Since it is hard to get custom matts in atypical colors without paying a lot, this frame allowed the wall color to come through which worked well for this Sargent (the artist).', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 12, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Beautiful and comes with best hanging kit ever - Read for Tips...', 'author': 'Judy B', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'These are beautiful wood frames. Two panes of glass with polished edges, so no cutting your hands while handing. Comes with an amazing kit (photo #1) that includes step-by-step instructions, and everything that makes preparing your art quite easy - including a little level, pencil, tape measure, glass cleaning cloth, and gloves (which make it easy to handle the glass without filling it with fingerprints), and options for attaching to the wall including screws with anchors or hammer tacks - all in a nifty plastic case. The kit is worth $10 alone. You do have to attach the hanging clip to the frame yourself (you\'ll need a philips screwdriver), but that way you can choose whether the frame will hang portrait or landscape orientation (see photos 2-3). Tip #1 - Don\'t use the glue dots that come in the kit to affix your art to the bottom glass (as a means of positioning it so it doesn\'t move around). I found that where the glue dots were placed, they created a \'bump\', and when pressed against the top glass and placed in the frame, those areas stuck to the top glass and were very noticeable. After seeing this and not being happy, I removed the glue dots (a pain) and instead used tiny pieces of double-sided Scotch tape to hold my art in position to the bottom glass. Much better. Tip #2 - Note that the 2 panes of glass slide into a slot cut into one of the11"" sides of the frame. Once assembled, you then insert clips over the glass to prevent the glass from slipping out (see photo 4). This works best for portrait landscape, because you can hang with slot to the top (and you won\'t see the slot or clips). But with landscape art, one of the sides will show the slot (photo 4). If you know in advance where you\'ll be hanging the landscape photo, you can attach the hanging clip so that the side slot and clips are in the least noticeable position, unless of course this doesn\'t bother you like it did me. I am really happy with the results.

It makes the artwork or photos feel more elegant and upscale. Really easy to use. You just pop out the glass from the front, put in your art, and pop the glass back in. It is almost perfect. The only complaint are what I'm calling micro flaws. Micro flaws I have experienced are as follows: having to wipe the glass with cleaner (not perfectly clean of dust and particles), the included border mat is delicate and not the best of quality but gets the job done, and lastly which may be a dealbreaker for some... micro cuts in the glass that only the person who setup the art in the frame would be able to tell. Micro as in squint your eyes because it's thinner than hair and maybe like half a finger nail length. And it's probably one in one spot for one every 3 frames.

Or you can insert something of an irregular shape and showcase it, such as a leaf, or a memorable flat object, or a collage of mementos, or a paper with rough edges.The wood is a great color, it matches very well with some other oak frames I have acquired recently. The woodworking is smooth and the grain looks nice, and there are two sawtooth hangers already mounted on back. Inside it has two sheets of real glass, so the frame is fairly heavy for its size, and needs careful handling. When you insert something inbetween the glass, you\'ll probably need to use some tape to hold it in position against the back sheet of glass.The glass slides out of one side, and it uses a strip of rope to hold it in place. I appreciate the ingenuity there, though it is a bit unexpected to look at. The rope color is a fair match for the wood and though it is visible, it\'s not distracting. If you hang the frame in portrait orientation you may not see the rope. The rope seems to unravel very slightly each time you slide it in and out, but fortunately it\'s very easy to replace if you ever needed to in the future.The only real drawback I encountered on mine is that the mounting hardware for the horizontal orientation was installed off center a bit. I\'ll still able to hang it with balance, but I need to use one of the sawtooth slots other than the center one.

However, there is an issue with the 5x7 3-frame sets, which I have ordered twice to confirm the problem. The frames are made with small, L-shaped staples that are cleanly pinned into the wood. 2 out of 3 of the frames in my first order had the mounting hardware placed on the FRONT side of the frame, thereby revealing the staples. If it was on all 3 frames, I might have actually forgiven this because even with my OCD, they are very straight, flush and one could maybe (BIG maybe) argue that they were a design feature. As a result of the mis-match and because these were going on a gallery wall with the same frames in other sizes (none of which had this problem), I couldn't handle it and ordered another set. The second set came with 1 out of 3 frames with the mounting hardware affixed to the wrong side. Between the two sets, I got the 3 frames I needed but I am quite annoyed.

Unfortunately, to my disappointment there isn't much more in the film it self and you start wondering was it really worth getting this DVD which costed me not less than some 50 euros. This high cost for me is explained by the fact that Framed is available only for region 1 and with mailing cost I had to pay something like 20 euros to get it. As my present DVD player shows movies for region 2 only, I bought a new player which covers all regions there are. So I paid in total something like 50 euros. Now that I'm cooled down I'm not anymore so disappointed because I was able to watch Framed and I probably watch it again one of these days.

Honestly, if it was just about me, I'd say these aren't all that special, but my cats freaking love these things and they do ensure a steady supply of food and water, so obviously I have to give them 4 stars. My biggest gripe is that the food container mouth is just too wide. I'm going to have to find a solution that narrows the mouth of it because the food just comes out at too fast of a speed. If you're not careful and you don't set it down carefully after refilling, you can spill the food all over because it just rushes out. The best way to connect the food reservoir to the base is to turn the whole thing upside down to snap the bottom onto the reservoir, then put your hand over the opening as you rotate it right side up to stop the food from escaping. There are also holes in the base which food can fall into and I can't see any way to get them out without prying the plastic bits apart, which is obviously not ideal. I have no notes for the water tower, that actually works perfectly. All in all, they're a bit frustrating to use and you have to learn tricks, but I have 5 cats with vastly different personalities and they love this set, so I have to give it 4 stars.

Now I just wipe out the storage container and shoot where the food falls out of with a wet cloth and I wash the dish with soap. I took everything apart initially with a screw driver because I wanted to thoroughly clean and dry it. This probably was not necessary.I don’t usually travel but I often spend a night away, come home from work late, sleep in, etc. These habits made it impossible for my cat to have a regular eating schedule and left me often asking my roommate to feed him. If you’re a better person/cat owner and can adhere to an actual schedule, good on you and you probably don’t need this.

I was feeding 3 tablespoons at 8am and 3 tablespoons at 8pm. As I’ve said, these times weren’t rigid and it left my cat irritable and hangry. I have programmed this for 4 small meals (2am- 1 tablespoon, 8am- 2 tablespoons, 2pm- 1 tablespoon, 8pm- 2 tablespoons), feeding him the same amount but evenly spaced out over the course of 24hrs. I started with 2 meals at the same times I was manually feeding him, (3 portions at both 8am and 8pm) but I noticed 12hrs in between meals led to hanger and bad behavior. I think 4 meals is the max amount you can program. 1 portion on this machine is 1 tablespoon and I have not gone over 3 portions but it does go higher (I think at least up to 4). He seems much more content throughout the day, he isn’t gorging himself since he’s getting smaller meals, and his moods are more regulated. Plus I have peace of mind knowing my cat is always fed the right amount at the right time. It works great, it’s easy to program and make adjustments.I just hope it works for a while and that if it does stop working I can notice it before my cat is too underfed.

More convenient and less expensive than arranging for someone else to come do it. But granted, there are no replacements for the human interaction.Setup is straightforward and it was pretty easy to get the quantity dialed in. After just two trials, I figured out that a portion setting of 18 would dispense 1 cup. Since kibble size varies, I think it’s understandable that a chart showing this setting doesn’t come with it.I found loading the batteries was a bit tricky. It was hard to get them int the compartment without bending the springs the wrong way. And on one side, once the battery was in, it sort of wanted to slide out of position. I was concerned this might break the contact but it seems the door keeps this from happening. Also, having to access the battery compartment through the bottom is awkward.One tip; I was able to TRIPLE the quantity held by taping the box it came in to the top of the unit. I lined the inside of the box with wax paper to keep the oils in the food from soaking into the box. Also, I used the folding box bottom as a replacement for the plastic top. Also, testing proved this did not seem to affect the performance of the dispensing apparatus and the quantity dispensed is still right on the money. Any unused meals can just be added back into the holding tank. This gives added comfort knowing that my boy will be fed for much longer than otherwise in the event something takes me out of the picture.

Almost two basic. If you didn't know how to use the technology, It was mild troubleshooting with the proportion size because they didn't actually tell you how big the size is were and they go up from 0 to 12. For my cats I feed them twice a day and portion size number four was perfect for them with the small pieces of food that I feed them. It does have backup batteries that you can install just in case power was to go out which happened on our trip that we left when we bought these feeders and luckily it stayed powered for the entire 8 hours we were out of electricity. I have one feeder inside and one outside for my outside cats. It's enclosed in a cat house to keep away from the elements.Disclaimer: It does say not to use outside but because I sheltered it it's fine. The only modification we had to use was screwing it into the cat house and taping. The lid shut because of possums and or raccoons that we're trying to get into the food or smarter than the latch mechanism itself, but for just cats in general it stopped them. So if you plan on using this for any outdoor cats that aren't in side just be aware it's easy to knock over.Positive: depending on your portion sides of course we were going a whole week and I filled the cat feeder completely full and I ran it a week prior to leaving. Then we got back a week later and it was still very full and it ran for a good month. So the proportion size was great because you can fill it up and just continue running it so you don't have to worry about ever forgetting feed your pets and you can save money with the correct proportion size. Small compact you can record your voice to have your animal come to you that seem to really work on my youngest cat. Food loves me to death and won't eat when I'm gone so that really help with separation anxiety.Cons: It will still continue to try to dispense food when it's empty so you just have to learn to check it and it gives you the option. I believe to feed up to four times a day and it doesn't really go into detail and instructions, but if you just hit zero it won't dispense any food. It just skips that time frame so you can literally put two spots at zero in your feeding time from like 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. And leave the other one zeros. But you have to go through each set up in order to feed them the amount of times you feed them. Not knowing what the proportion size were were a trouble shoot. I had to set the timer to go off and then reset it all once I figured out how big and small proportions were.

My only concern is that I am using this solely on battery power and it appears that the low battery indicator light doesn't function as intended. I also suspect that the icon showing battery level is not reliable either. I concluded this because I inadvertently installed a couple of dead batteries in the first set of 3 D batteries. The display screen didn't illuminate until I plugged in the unit using the power cable. The low battery indicator light was not on, and the battery icon showed 2 bars. Even with no batteries installed, the low battery light wasn't lit and the battery icon showed 2 bars. After testing the batteries and finding the dead ones, I installed better batteries. The unit has been operating perfectly on those batteries for nearly 3 weeks, and I'm happy with its performance. But, when these batteries finally die, I might not get any advance warning. That's OK if I'm feeding the dog while I'm around the house, but it would be unfortunate if I was gone all day and the batteries failed with no warning (I never leave the dog at home if gone overnight, but for people who might have a pet sitter come visit, that could be critical if the pet sitter didn't realize no food was being dispensed for more than a day.

As they got older, they grew to dislike eating right next to each other (the sister is a bit of an aggressive eater), so we needed to get a new feeder for her. We tried one of these out, and loved it so much we bought two more.They're very compact in size, but fairly stable. They're also much better at stopping our aggressive eater from trying to sneak food, as with the old ones she could paw up the shoot and get some kibble to drop out. These feeders do not keep food in every chamber (every other, 3 out of 6 chambers) so she can't get food to drop down in between feedings.They were very easy to clean and set up. We are trying them with batteries to test the longevity (the description claims up to 180 days), because it's nice that we can move them if needed during company or set them up in locations without needing an outlet.The price is awesome, and these feeders are a perfect solution for us. I highly recommend giving these a try. If longevity on battery life ends up being a problem, they still come with a proper USB Cable & Block for operation plugged in without batteries. One thing the instructions don't clearly state is if batteries are installed while it's plugged in via the USB if the batteries are only used as backup...I wish that was outlined in the directions as it just describes each individual method of powering the unit. Overall, though, you can't beat the product at this price range. Our other feeders were $80 and $120 each and these are much better quality and easier to use.Update: After 1 month of use, the only con I have with these feeders is their time software is extremely off. Three times I have reset the Clocks on all three units, right next to each other on the counter, and they initially go off exactly at the the same time.

Worked perfectly for 7 months, but a few weeks ago, my cat seemed to be hungry more often, going to the cabinet where her food is. I looked at her feeder and although the display showed everything as being correct, it did not dispense food at the time it should have, and neither would it dispense when I pressed the manual button! I unplugged the feeder, took batteries out, emptied it and checked the rotor inside but could not get the feeding tray to move or be removed!

If you're looking for automation, look no further! Over the past month my cat has been able to not only eat consistent portions of meals, but also done so at a regularly scheduled timeframe that I have decided.Delivery: Overall the packaging was minimal yet arrived securely. Cleanup was fast as there was only a few protective plastics to throw away. The box was mid-sized, not weighing very much.Setup: Following the instruction booklet is easy. If you prefer a visual aid, you also can watch a how-to on YouTube! Serving sizes are calculated correctly, allowing any number of combinations you desire to feed your pet cat. Do you prefer they eat three times a day? No worries! Five? Say less. Six times but with less food per serving? You can do it! The options are endless. I use Purina pro plan for kittens which is a smaller size kibble. I was afraid the size would cause a problem with the portions this device uses, but luckily it was able to change effortlessly to an increment I desired for my pet.Features: I truly enjoy the ability to have the choice between a wireless or wired system. Having the option is great as some outlets are not conveniently located near my current food dish. The battery pack allows for a very long power duration. I am always scared about power outages at home while I am away for vacations. With the ability to go battery powered vs plug-in, it enables a backup incase the power does shutoff. I also enjoy the protective cover for the menu options. My cat loves to swat anything she sees, and having the protective cover prevents her from changing any settings I have put in place.Complaints: Overall I can't complain about much. I do know competitors offer a voice feature that allows you to use a speak a pre-recorded clip when it's time to dispense the next meal. Though this is missing, the added food dish is metal, allowing any kibble being dispensed to make a small but noticeable clanking noise when dropped. My cat has had no issues hearing her next meal being dispensed, but if it becomes a problem in the future, I will update.Final thoughts: The PETLIBRO Automatic cat feeder has been an exceptional addition to my home, allowing a simple and effective way to plan, portion, and produce timely meals for my lovely fur baby.

Not only does it make feeding time a breeze, but its versatility for small dogs like my Yorkie has made it an indispensable part of our daily routine.Let\'s start with the primary function – dispensing pet food. The feeder is incredibly efficient, delivering the perfect portion of food at the designated times. The customizable feeding schedule ensures that my furry friend never misses a meal, promoting a healthy and consistent eating routine. The food storage capacity is generous, reducing the need for constant refilling.What sets this smart feeder apart is its compatibility with small dogs, like my Yorkie. Despite being marketed as a cat feeder, it has seamlessly integrated into my dog\'s feeding routine. The portion sizes are adjustable, accommodating the dietary needs of different pets, and the design prevents any spillage or overfeeding.Now, let\'s talk about the ""smart"" features – and they are nothing short of fantastic! The ability to program my voice to announce feeding time is a game-changer. The first time my Yorkie heard my voice coming from the feeder, her excitement was palpable. It adds a personal touch to the feeding routine and, I believe, provides a sense of reassurance for our pets.The setup process was straightforward, whether I\'m at home or away my pet will get fed as long as there is food in the dispenser lol. The durability of the feeder and the quality of materials used inspire confidence in its long-term reliability.In conclusion, the Smart Automatic Cat Feeder has made pet care incredibly convenient and enjoyable. Its adaptability for small dogs, like my Yorkie, showcases its versatility beyond its initial cat-focused marketing.

Does have some problems, though.', 'author': 'Tiana', 'rating': 4, 'content': ""I bought this feeder at the end of January because I was about to leave for a week-long trip but couldn't find a pet sitter every day so short notice for my cat. The feeder worked really well for what I needed, my boy didn't starve and I was able to keep him on his normal schedule with the normal ringtone I use to indicate when it's feeding time and it's very easy to program, clean, and open up to put more food in.BUT, I did come across a few issues with this feeder. First off, the clock on it is ever so slightly off. I bought this feeder January 27th and have used it every day to feed my boy, but my girl gets fed out of a normal bowl. He's the only one who stays behind when I go places because she gets 2x daily meds and therefore someone HAS to watch her every single day, so it just didn't make sense to buy one for her yet. If I wasn't constantly adjusting the time, it would be off by 10 minutes from what the time actually is. So, when my alarm on my phone goes off to feed my girl, my boy is running around confused on why his feeder isn't going off/why he's having to wait to eat a full minute or so after her. I would not of gotten this feeder just for this issue, quite frankly, because now I know this feeder will never be in sync with a second feeder unless I bought this exact feeder again.Second issue, THE TOP DOES NOT STAY ON WELL! It fits snuggly, but does not clip in, so for hungry/bored kitty paws, it's no match. While I was gone, my cat gained 3lbs just because he learned how to knock over the feeder and open the top. I was very disappointed.Third, and this one wasn't as big of a deal, but the recording device is really stupidly placed. Other's have said this in their reviews, but I'll say it too: who's brilliant idea was it to place the recording button directly under the batteries that you have to push in place?!SO, if you have no need for a feeder with a precise clock, have a kitty that won't be smart enough to pry open a non-clipping top, and either don't need the recording aspect or don't need to ever have it unplugged/use batteries, this is the feeder for you! It's really not that bad of a feeder for general use, but I need something better.

On those days, he needed to wait 4 extra hours to eat his mid-day meal, which by then, he was really hungry and I felt so bad! With this auto-feeder, I can program up to 6 meals a day of dry food. I ended up only giving a small portion 3 times a day, 6 am (so he doesn't wake me early in the morning), 2 pm, and 4 pm, while I feed his can food when I wake up and before I go to bed. His hunger is pretty much satiated and I can make sure he doesn't overeat (he over ate before the hyperthyroid condition developed), while keeping him at the correct weight.

And so I felt the need to explore gravity feeders once more. The other day I researched too gravity feeders and these were the top choice. So I said ok let's do it. ( I'll never go back)!!! My car cannot knock these over and the food dispenser on its own, ( no shaking) and what's even better is the water container is spring fed top As in you can pull it out of the base and you won't have a mess. These were far from a disappointment and a miracle in my life. 🤣😁"", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States March 3, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars auto feeders', 'author': 'Amazon Customer', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'the two stray cats in my yard love these auto feeders!

This feeder has so far been everything I was looking for when I needed to replace my old one.- very quiet when dispensing food, loudest sound was the food hitting the bowl. (No grinding or gear turning sounds to wake me up, which is perfect since the goal is to NOT have to wake up early to feed the cat who will pester me until she gets what she wants).- the food bowl & food storage container both detach from the feeder to make for very easy cleaning without worrying about destroying the electric parts.- the cat food I use is larger than most, 10-11mm according to the information given on the bag, & seems to come out perfectly fine & consistently, which was a problem with the old one.- portion sizing actually seems really convenient, a single portion is very small but that means you can really control just how much is dispensed if your pet needs to get an accurate amount. I measured it out & for the food I use, 4 portions is a quarter cup. You can choose up to 12 portions per meal, & 4 meals per day, so I can’t imagine it not being enough.- setting everything up was very straightforward & didn’t take much to figure out. It does come with a little manual in several languages. The only thing I struggled with was getting it to do an unscheduled/manual feeding, but I think you’re supposed to just press & let go of the +/- buttons & I was pressing & holding. Seems to be working fine once I figured that out.- you can choose the time of every feeding, it doesn’t simply divide the day by number of feedings.Minor cons that don’t really affect my overall happiness with the product:- food storage container is a bit small, it holds maybe a quarter or a third of my 15 lb. bag of food. It should still last a while, so I’m not concerned about having to refill it that often, but for reference, I am feeding just 1 medium sized cat.- the food bowl doesn’t really attach securely to the feeder, it hooks in place but if you lift the feeder at all, it unhooks. I wish it would latch or clip in more securely, but I like that it does completely detach for cleaning, so I’ll take the trade off.- the LED panel is not at an angle, so you either have to tilt the feeder or get on eye level to see it. I wish the panel were tilted up so I could just see it when looking down at it, but I don’t think this will be a regular annoyance since I will mostly just set it & forget it.I saw a couple reviewers saying their feeder broke down quickly, but so far it seems pretty well made & sturdy, so I’m hoping that it will last a long time & it does come with a 2 year warranty according to the manual.

She sits there and waits but never gets her food :( I tried taking it apart and cleaning it out but still no results. I’m not sure why it’s not dispensing :/4/05/23 I looked and there are not many reviews for bunnies on here, at least none that answered my main questions so I’m going to answer them here.(1) YES this works for bunny pellet food(2) NO she cannot get the food inside and yes she has tried(3) ONE portion is a little under 1/8 of a cup and two portions is about a full 1/8 scoop and a half, so I set it to two portions and I actually think it’s the perfect amount for bunnies. Personality if it’s around 1/4 or more it’s too much for bunnies in my opinion.I set the feeding to 7:30am but I think I’m going to change it to 7am, she starts waiting for it earlier and bunnies ARE early risers.All in all my only complaint is that some of the pellets get crushed every time it dispenses so there is some powdery food dispensed as well. Either way bun bun eats it so it’s not a huge deal to me. After all it IS meant for cat food. With my work schedule it has been hard to keep breakfast feedings consistent. I want to have a routine and I also occasionally need someone to feed her for me, so this was a great solution!

And when it’s around his feeding times, he will yell at me, harassed me for an hour or more until I feed him. Sometimes he starts harassing me at 3 o’clock in the afternoon, I will not feed him until 5. He also would seek out food, getting into cupboards, etc. Shady ?$&$. Constantly seeking food. I had to put child locks on the cupboards to keep him out.So I bought this with the thought I could feed him more than two times a day and maybe he would stop with the demanding to be fed.It actually has worked. I feed him four times a day with this, he doesn’t harass me looking for food. Except for the one time when it was empty. I can leave and I don’t have to be here around his feeding time at 5 PM.But because he is always seeking food, he does try and reach his arm up in there to get food and he does get a few pieces of kibble. But I’m assuming that’s coming out of his next meal so he’s not getting anything extra. I also did have to tether this to the wall with a child cupboard lock. Because the first morning that I woke up, he had it in the middle of the floor and unplugged.The only negative things I have to say about this is I wish the bowl would attach because he’s always digging it out. So when the food does come out, it goes on the floor. And the other is I wish the instruction manual somewhere told you exactly how much is in each serving. I think I might be giving him more in the four feedings we’ll see if he gains weight. And it doesn’t seem like you can give different servings during the different feedings. So there’s four feedings it doesn’t seem like you can change it to one serving for two meals and two servings for two other meals. I could be wrong on that if he gains weight and I am able to do some thing like that, I will update this review. But when setting up the feeding times, and the number of servings, it was already at two servings when I went to do the other meals.I’ve had it for about a month, it does help for his constantly seeking food. I can leave him out at night, and he isn’t doing shady things in the middle of the night other than trying to get his arm and get some extra out. In fact, the other night, I forgot some food on the counter, he did try and get one cracker, and ate some of that. But he didn’t try and get into the rest of the food.

My dog is a 35lb husky mix, so not a huge pup. This machine holds about a weeks worth of food, at 3 servings a day on the ""6"" setting which is about a cup and a half. If you have a big dog, I would recommend getting a larger machine otherwise you will be filling this thing every other day or so. For cats and small/medium dogs, it\'s perfect. You will need the booklet to figure out how to set it up, but it is not rocket science. Hold down the lock button to ""unlock"" the display then hold down the other button and the time will start flashing. You set the time, then you set the time(s) of day you want the food to be dispensed and how much at each meal. The nice thing about this unit is there are 6 meal option settings and you can release a different amount each meal. So if you want your pup to eat more in the morning, a little less at lunch and then more again at dinner, that\'s do-able. The best feature as far as ease of use for me is that the top comes off with the pinch of a button. This makes it SO easy to fill. You do not have to unscrew anything or turn the machine over (you don\'t even have to pick the machine up) - just pop off the top and add more food. They even include a little packet to keep the container and food dry and fresh which would be important if you live somewhere humid. I live somewhere that is dry, so not a big deal but nice to know it\'s there. Just be sure to tape it down to the inside top of the lid really well so it doesn\'t fall into the food and get dispensed as those little bags are not meant to be eaten (and could be toxic?). I used duct tape for mine just to be safe!This machine is holding up well on D batteries...seems like it will last awhile on battery power. I have used it for 2 weeks straight with 3 meals a day being dispensed and it is still going strong.It a nutshell - it is small (great if you don\'t have a lot of space), is easy to fill, looks nice overall, set-up isn\'t too bad, works well, meal portion size options are great and unless you have a big pup, should meet your needs for keeping you pup/cat fed for a week before having to be filled.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 29, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Easy to use and tough as nails', 'author': 'Mark', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I purchased this to feed the community cats around my house while away.

We didn’t need wifi, cameras, or anything else that could break or malfunction or complicate things - just a feeder where we could set the time and the portion size, so this fit the bill.Pros:• It was easy to set up the clock and set schedules and portion sizes while following along with the manual.• I also like that pretty much every piece that touches the food can be washed including the container and the silo that pushes the food out. You have to wipe out the chute manually since it’s attached to the electronic part which is no big deal.• It runs without the batteries in, but I like the battery option for going away just in case the power ever went out when we weren’t home.• I unplugged it once to add a longer power cord and thought I would have to reset the whole program, but after about 20-30 seconds it automatically maintained what I had already set, which is nice.• Our cat isn’t a food fiend so hasn’t tried to break into it, but the twist lock on the top seems like it would prevent that pretty well.• One portion is about 1/8 cup of our kibble. The small 3L size holds a surprising amount of food and using the smallest portion size 2x per day, should last at least a month’s worth or more.• We’re transitioning our cat from the dry food she had at the shelter to one that’s a bit more high quality and using this has made it a breeze to transition slowly over the month - I simply added her old food at the bottom, a mix of the two in the middle, and the new food on top, so each day a little bit more of the new food gets mixed in.Cons:• It’s a little rough to take the container off the base, and twist the silo part off as well - I split a nail in the process! Someone with mobility issues or neuropathy would likely have a tough time.• Wish the cord was a little longer. It’s a bit under 5ft and I needed 6 to secure it along the wall and make it look nice where I wanted to place it, so I had to buy a longer one. It’s also a USB-C to USB-A cable which makes it bulkier where I need to plug it in.• Wish it had a “skip” or “hold” option. While learning our cat’s habits I sometimes manually dispensed a portion but would forget that the timed one was still coming, so she’d get extra.Misc/Overall:Didn’t use or need the recording feature, since our goal was to not have her associate us with food, so can’t speak to that. I bought a pack of desiccant packets from another brand which I’ll plan on swapping out once per month. I’d also recommend manually dispensing a portion or two the first time you fill it/whenever you refill it until the food comes out, because the first one came out empty - the food needs to make its way down the chute, and then it works fine.

Initially, I had some issues with this unit. The battery compartment in the original base had springs that were the wrong size rendering the battery backup function unusable. But PetLibro stood behind its product and replaced the faulty base. Problem solved. I just had another issue with the notification function in the app not working properly and, although I had to go through two different customer service representatives, I finally got that issue fixed as well. The fact that PetLibro stands behind its products and follows up on active customer service cases is a huge plus in its favor, huge. You just don't see actual customer service much anymore. Although I had a rocky start, I now wouldn't hesitate to purchase another PetLibro product in the future.The unit, which is now fully functional, is great. My kitty is all about food and cannot self regulate her eating. I already had gotten a PetLibro non WIFI feeder back in the spring. I decided to upgrade in order be able to virtually monitor the feeder functions from my tablet. This newer WIFI has a low food warning, so you don't have to manually check the food reservoir frequently, a tighter, better closing lid (better to keep critters out), the ability to provide snacks and change meal times/sizes remotely without having to touch the physical unit itself (which is much easier and less of a hassle) and it also enables you to increase/ decrease the volume on announcements. The food reservoir has a nice large capacity. I've had zero issues with kibble jamming up the despenser mechanism. The app itself is a little rough around the edges and does need some improvements. The interface is somewhat clunky and primitive both in appearance and layout but I get the impression that the company is working on that. The one thing I really think needs to be improved on the feeder is the design of the food bowl. It doesn't lock into place and is too easily nudged out of position sometimes causing food to be dispensed on the floor rather than in the bowl. But, overall, it's a very good WIFI enabled feeder.

We feed her twice a day and had someone checking in on her but wanted her morning feeding to be automated.Thus fit the need perfectly.When we switched to feeding our dog from once a day to twice a day, she got trained to expecting her food at that time or even earlier. She started barking at us from 5 am. Not so bad on a work day but on the weekends it got old fast. By switching to this automated feeder she has not begged us for her morning feeding.We feed her a Hill’s ID prescription food which comes in a non round / uniform shape, about 12-14 mm wide. I was a bit concerned that it would plug in the feeder but it has not plugged yet. Sometimes you can hear it struggling a bit as it turns and kibbles readjust. Turns and provides a consistent amount of food. For our food we set it at 6 and it measures out just under one cup of food. Their 7 setting gives just over one cup. Considering that the sizes I’d say it is fairly accurate and consistent in measurement of food.I have it plugged into our block rocker usb so not running off batteries. If the power goes off there is enough power to keep it running. It has the option to put batteries in but I opted out cause I can envision not checking these and having them corrode.The build quality is good. If I were to an add anything I would say to add loops or other provision for straps. It is light so my dog can knock it over. I have seen others strap it down and loops incorporated into the sleek design would make it perfect. I’d say design it to strap to a 25 lb Olympic plate or two 20 lb plates would be nice. It stores about 15-16 cups of food. So far we have not had any ant issues.There is an upgraded unit with sealed food compartment but the reviews are not as good on that one.

I like the see-through window to see how much food is left. I like the ""meal call"" feature. I haven\'t had any problems yet with food jamming or ""ghost"" notifications like low food levels or low battery like other reviews had mentioned. I haven\'t really needed the lock feature quite yet. My cat is smart, but not that smart. I also do really like the backup battery power. We lose our power quite a lot. It\'s good to know at least our cat will be fed for at least as long as the batteries last before we get home.I think the only thing that I\'m gonna regret is not buying the one with the camera. We are out of the house traveling a lot. Our last one (Antblocker) had a camera and it was nice to have live video confirmation of our pet actually being fed rather than just relying on the app to tell us. I usually set up an auxiliary camera anyway. So maybe it won\'t be an issue.I am noticing that portion size may be a tiny bit inaccurate. My pictures show the lowest possible amount to be dispensed 1/12 cup. Seems it may be more towards an 1/8 C or more. Our cat has been used to 3 small portions of dry food throughout the day (including 1/3 can of wet twice a day). I wish there was a smaller portion size. We may have to drop to twice a day. And, the desiccant pouch in the lid is a nice touch but may be overkill. I don\'t plan on buying desiccant packs for a pet feeder.Overall and so far, it seems it\'s gonna be a good product.

However, a new job for my partner and I has left us not being able to get home for their 6pm feedings on time.I had considered automatic feeders for awhile but as I have said, with 3 cats.. 3 feeders is expensive and I didn’t want to invest in anything ridiculously overpriced or something that wouldn’t work consistently.I did not need an app or any of that nonsense really. I already have cameras in my house so I didn’t need the extra gizmos and gadgets. I was specifically looking for: affordable, consistent portion control, something that can stand up to two very determined kitties and simplicity.PROS:You have the option to set up to 6 meals per day.Portion size works as follows: 1 portion is about 1/8 cup — this was consistent for the 10 times I tried it and will update if that changes.It deposits the food fairly timely..It is rather quiet, not a whole lot of whirring and noise, my cats were completely unbothered but mine think anything that gives them food is well worth any risk.It’s easy to set up. If you were born before the year 1980 then maybe not so much but I’m a millennial and this was not an issue at all. If you could work a Nokia, you can work this.It’s easy to take apart. There’s two eject buttons on either side of the main tank that allows you to pull it apart for cleaning.It can use batteries or wire adapter. I like this feature cause I’m not willing to buy a ten pack of D batteries every few months no thank you. I do like the idea that if the power goes out however, it won’t reset everything since it had battery reserve.It is KITTY PROOF - my little bean has been messing with this thing since getting it a few hours ago. Let me preface this with she is a small girl, 9lbs. Tiny but mighty and never lacking in the determination department. She is VERY familiar with puzzle bowls and to her this was no exception.. however, much to her dismay she has been unable to pry it apart. Thank GOODNESSYou can probably use other bowls for this if you slightly elevate the tank. Literally put a dictionary under it and slide a maze bowl underneath. TA da.CONS:There’s no extra gadgets like camera or WiFi app etc. so if that’s your thing this isn’t for you. Likewise, the voice recorder sucks. Don’t even bother. You may as well use a can tied to a string to get your message across.The user interface aka “the buttons” — this was annoying because it’s like setting an old digital alarm clock in that you have to cycle through ALL SIX FEEDING TIMES whether you’re using them or not to get to your clock/time whatever. This was mainly an issue for me while setting the time cause I accidentally set it to AM instead of PM, oops, silly me, that’ll be a quick fix— OH NVM I have to cycle allllll the way back through to switch that, if you click too fast then you gotta cycle again. How fun.This was the only reason I docked a star but past that, it’s fine.You can manually give 1 portion, I don’t think there’s a way to make it more than that, also it will still give their designated feeding portion even if you give a manual one so keep that in mind.I will continue experimenting with this and update if I find anything new or fun to talk about, enjoy the video of my kitty being very disappointed.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States April 9, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Love it.

More feedings in restricted smaller amounts haved helped her overcome daily purging. (ick) I\'ve never owned an automatic feeder and I bought this PetLibro version because it allows up to 10 scheduled feedings a day and all 7 days may be customized individually, though I only use the copy day feature at this time to make all days the same. What I find very valuable is that each scheduled feeding may be sized from 0-4cups of kibble(food) in 1/12 increments, so 48 different feeding sizes that I measured to be very accurate cup for cup. Understand the physics of it though because smaller the kibble(size of dry food) the more accurate the measurements. If you want to know exactly how much kibble is dispensed then (clean and dry all pieces that come in contact with food first), assemble dry parts, fill container, dispense 2-3 full cups first to ensure the internal air pockets are removed to ensure accurate measurements, then dispense and measure each of the levels from 1/12th to 12/12ths and compare it to your normal feeding size. KNOW THIS - medium to large kibble won\'t function well in this feeder. I intend to continue using the small kibble Purina Puppy Chow and I feel good about the feeder\'s size precision. At $70 the price is right as I didn\'t feel the need to spend more to add a camera to the feeder. Install and use of the mobile app was very easy and straightforward. I like option to record my own voice that plays prior to each feeding. What\'s cool is that everyone in my family may record a ""Come Eat"" audio and you can manually change which ones plays anytime you want from within the app. Oh, and the app may be installed on multiple phones so that everyone in the family can keep track of feedings and alerts. I did learn that the app\'s auto find of device from phone only works AFTER plugging in the PetLibro feeder. I installed the 3 \'D\' size batteries first and lights appear as does minimal functionality however Bluetooth signal is off until the device is also plugged in. Some reviews reported that they couldn\'t connect phone to feeder however I believe this was their issue. The batteries are designed for back up only when loss of power occurs - the device turns off wifi and BT to conserve energy to ensure dog gets fed. The food container holds 5 days of food for my 50# Labradoodle and the device has indicator light and an app push notification to indicate time for food refill. Food container looks to have a good tight seal to keep food fresh. There is also a desiccant pouch that should be replaced every week or month - though I\'ve read that desiccant\'s may be renewed in microwave or dehydrator.

I also want the best for them because they bring me happiness and love during times when I need it the most so things like having a clean water bowl seem to be the least I can do for them. The bowl itself feels good in the hand. Not too heavy, not too light. It also comes equipped with some very functional non-skid pads on the bottom to prevent the bowl from sloshing about while in use. The resevoir can hold one gallon and is made from the same material the five gallon jugs use.

Once it's released it stops the water from flowing out even when upside down. The jug fits snugly and has two stubs on each side that line up with an opening on the ring so when it's mounted, the jug slides gently into place and locks with a small twist. The channel between the bowl and where the water flows from is narrow to keep the water from pouring into the bowl and making a mess.

Great video and notifications', 'author': 'S.

Since my cat eats 4x per day, and I only auto-feed 2x, sometimes I\'ll forget to feed her until I\'m sitting down, and it\'s really convenient to hit a button to feed her.There are a couple of things that could be improved upon:1) The instructions to put in the SD/TF card are a little hard to understand - but it\'s under the hopper and above the feed wheel.2) The video records continuously, so you may need to re-format the card frequently. Some of my other security cameras only record when motion is detected (and maybe a minute on either side of the motion), so a 30 GB card will last a long time. My card is roughly 1/3 used after 4 days. That being said, there were stills of motion images before I even inserted an SD card, so there must be some sort of memory of some sort.3) The top of the food hopper twists off to open or close, but it\'s hard to see which direction is open or closed, so I wrote ""open"" on the cover.4) The app to watch video was not very intuitive. It will take some playing around with the navigation to figure out how to watch video or cue up motion detector shorts rather than watching a continuous stream of video.Overall - this is another outstanding product from this company.

In the beginning, I was paranoid that my babies would not be fed appropriately or that they would not know the food was in the bowl. It has fed flawlessly. Setup was much easier than I expected with the only issue being that you have to go all the way through it if you miss something. It is not that big of a deal though and once you set it, it is fairly easy to change it. My only issue with portion control is I feel like 3 portions is a bit too much and 2 portions is not quite enough. My solution is to do my morning feeding with 3 portions and my night feeding with 2 portions. This seems to weigh it out effectively. I like that you can tell if it is on battery power or electricity and you can tell how much battery is left with just a glance. The splitter is great. You do need to follow the instructions to tilt it just a little to one side to get equal distributions but it is just a tiny tilt. So far, my cats have not broken into it nor have they figured out how to make it auto dispense. The lid is very snug and even if they knocked it over, I don\'t think it would spill. The time delay on the settings button is good because the cats do not know how to hold the button. I have no issues with the cats not hearing it as it makes a decent amount of noise falling into the metal bowls. The cats anticipate it\'s food time and if they don\'t happen to be waiting on the food to fall they hear it and go flying to the feeder before I even hear it hit the bowl. They can hear the faint whirring as it starts to spin to drop the food. Overall, I am extremely pleased and feel a lot more comfortable about knowing they will get to eat (at least their dry food) even if I am late getting home or if I would need to be away overnight. It works well with Hills Rx CD food.One side note.... they were scared of it at first but within a week, they were fine. Give your pet a little time to acclimate before you give up.

It makes feeding time really simple. It’s also well made and fairly well thought out. For example the food hopper on top has a slot in the lid for desiccant packets to keep the food dry and fresh. The bowls are removable for cleaning. And there is an adjustable tab at the dispenser that allows you to adjust how much food goes into each bowl. We use 50/50 but you could do like 60/40 if you have a cat on a diet or something.

Pros & Cons', 'author': 'JM', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'This is a great feeder, but there are a few things I\'ve come across that I want to share.FOOD: TYPE: Doesn\'t work well with meow mix or special shaped/larger cat food. Works best with food like science diet, costco brand - smaller, round bits PORTION: Not consistent. One serving sometimes only throws out a few bits, and barely anything if using Meow Mix (hence comment above). This isn\'t necessarily a deal breaker because you can simply program it to dispense more. ""One Serving"" for my cat is actually 3 with this feeder. BLOCKAGE: No Issues with blockage.POWER: It plugs in and takes D batteries for a backup power supply. Our power has gone out several times and my settings are saved even without batteries.CAPACITY: It holds A LOT of food. One fill lasts me a couple of weeks with 2 cats.EASE-OF-USE: Extremely easy to program. You can also quickly unlock it by holding down the lock icon, and quickly change any or bypass the schedule and feed now.FINAL THOUGHTS: I Love this, but I recently bought the wifi model, which I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!! The extra money it costs is nothing compared to the additional features and peace of mind it offers. For one, you can control it through the App 100%. It notifies you when the food is low, or if there\'s a blockage or any issue at all. If you\'re on vacation, you can monitor it from wherever to make sure it\'s working and that your cat is getting fed. I\'ve found the App to be extremely accurate. I use it to feed a stray cat outside since she runs away if I come near. With this, I can tap a button on my phone when I see her and the food automatically dispenses. I had it sitting outside in cold below-zero temperatures and it worked great. Every night a pack of raccoons try to break into it, but they haven\'t succeeded yet. The only thing they\'re able to do to it is to detach the front tray, which easily slips back on. Raccoons can usually tear anything up if there\'s food inside, but they haven\'t been able to do any damage to this, which says a lot!!! Granted, I\'m talking about the wifi model, but it\'s made the same as this one.You will not be disappointed with this brand!

Beautiful in white. Takes a little time to program, but is not hard.This model doesn't come with Wifi for mobile app. From what I read of the other model it didn't seem to me it offered the functionality to set the mealtimes from an app, so I did not care for that.This model's instructions don't say what it considers to be a portion size. I imagine it depends on the kibble size you're using, but it could give an approximation for small or bigger size because, after all, it's marketed for cats and there isn't much difference in kibble size as for dogs. So, I waited for it to dispense a portion to see if it was enough or how many portions to program for one meal or at a set time. For my two cats I programmed two portions for their early morning first meal of the day and for late afternoon because one portion has very few kibbles. I used to measure with a cup their meals, so I expected some kind of reference.After setting the meals and watching what my cats usually eat and expect, I now see that I have to program again to add another portion for one of the meals, but I was lazy at first and just gave them a manual feed until I have the time to do the programming again.I recorded my voice to call on the cats in a normal speaking level, which they don't seem to understand if they are in the same living room, but it gets their attention. They don't hear it from farther out, but I don't want to bother the next-door apartment with a louder call. It's the sound of the kibbles dropping to the metal dish that make them go to it, naturally. The best thing is that I don't have to get up at 5 a.m. to feed them and don't have to be harassed by them until I did. They are the sweetest most well-behaved cats, but turn into hooligans if you don't feed them at 5 a.m."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 15, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars I love the 21st Century!', 'author': 'Big Mike', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Very easy to set up, very easy to program, very easy to walk away and not have to worry about feeding cats on a routine every day.After reading other reviews, here are my observations.The portion size is not adjustable, but there\'s a very easy and obvious fix. It\'s not going to come out at the size that *you* personally may prefer, however, you can set it such that each time it dispenses it sends out 1, 2 or 5 or 50 (or higher) portions, so you get exactly the amount you feel is right, right on schedule. The trick is to take a minute before you set it out and hit the portion button with food in the hopper. Note how much there is then keep count while hitting the button until you see as much food as you wish in both bowls. Mine is set to dispense 5 portions which perfectly satisfies my speedy fuzz cats at both scheduled feeding times.There is a small gate that you place in between the bowls. You do not set it perfectly straight to get even amounts, rather, you skew to the right. The reason is that this dispenses from a wheel type mechanism that has a bias to fill more on the right than left, simple physics. Setting the pointer so that when you\'re looking at it there is about a 1/5th bias towards the right hand side, will open up the dispensing so that more comes in on the left and less comes in on the right. It took exactly ten seconds to figure this out. Just a bit of trial and error and you should be set.The programming isn\'t intuitive at first, but follow the manual instructions and it works out fine. I do not have to think about what to press to get desired results any longer. The term we used to use back in the day is RTFM (read the ""fine"" manual), which turns out is great advice.The battery backup is sweet because it seems like the cats might ""accidentally"" pull the cord out if they\'re feeling inclined, or frisky, or just want to cause trouble. It uses 3 x C batteries, so come prepared for that as it doesn\'t ship with batteries in the box.All in all I love the feeder so far, and recommend it (again, so far).

These are the design flaws I discovered with this product:1. The steel bowls fit so tightly into the bowl frame you can't readily remove them from the top for cleaning.To remove bowls, you take out the tiny divider gate piece, and disconnect the bowl frame from the feeder. Then you can take the bowl frame to the sink to flip the bowls out.That could be fixed by drilling a hole in the bottom of the bowl frame. Then you can poke the bowl out from below with your finger without having to disassemble everything.2. You can't use your own bowls, and no food chute-drop.Better designed dual feeders have chutes that drop food down into the bowl. This lets you substitute your bowls. This feeder is flush-mounted, no chute-drop. You're forced to use their bowls as nothing else will fit the bowl frame.A side-effect of this flush-mount design is that there is a seam between bowl and frame that catches crumbs. The chute-drop design does not have this seam.I was hoping for a third-party dual feeder chute attachment that would let you use your own bowls, but could not find it.3. I don't get that little gate divider piece design.A minor point, but what is with this so-called feature that lets you divert more food to the right bowl vs the left (but not more food to the left bowl). Who actually wants this? <1%? This is bad design suggested by the product engineer not a result from customer feedback.Just simplify design, assembly, and instructions by making it 50-50.4. The food hopper is a narrow vertical design.With a vertical design versus horizontal, the mouth of the hopper is smaller. That makes it much more challenging to fill the hopper, especially with a large, heavy bag of food.A better design is the horizontal hopper.5. The hopper window is too narrow to see food level at a glance.When the inside the hopper is dark and you have dark cat food, it's hard to see what's going on without closer inspection. I was actually looking for a way to get a small dim LED into the hopper to compensate.They should enlarge the window. maybe make it the same width the the food exit opening.Ultimately the bowl issues were too much for me, and I moved on to something else, ipettie dual. It has none of these design issues, but we'll see if there are others. *iPettie had other issues and I moved on to PetSafe Smart Feed for the win.-----*2023-07 update: customer support reached out to me and let me know feedback was received, so I added one star back in for excellent customer service."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States June 19, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Works well overall, but the low food warning is useless', 'author': 'Modest Moose', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'Works well and easy to schedule and set up several feedings and the weird little moveable arm to help control the food split between bowls works surprisingly well.

Jardieu', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'I purchased this PETLIBO cat feeder to replace one from a different manufacturer. The old one failed to feed when the plastic fins on the plastic rotor all broke off. I attempted to order a replacement rotor, the only part that I could find listed for that model feeder anywhere on the internet. The manufacturer was offshore and provided no contact information whatsoever. The replacement rotor didn’t fit my machine so I returned it and started my search for a different / better machine.That original feeder served me pretty well for about 2 years of continuous outdoor service in a protected location shielded from direct rain and snow. The old one had a capacity of 7 litters, but the PETLIBO is only 5 or 5-1/2 litters. As a result of this difference, I have to refill it every 5 days instead of every 7 for the old one. I wished that it held more, but that wasn’t a deal breaker for me.PETLIBO - PLEASE CONSIDER OFFERING A TALLER, HIGHER CAPACITY FOOD RESERVOIR OPTION TO FIT THIS MACHINE.My old one wasn’t WiFi enabled but the PETLIBO is. The app loaded easily on my iPhone and it works surprisingly well. I didn’t think that I’d use that feature all that much, but as it turns out after a few months in use, I do.The PETLIBO is intended for indoor use only but I’m feeding a large colony of feral cats so indoors wasn’t an option. The feeder sits exactly where my original one did, under a picnic table with an impervious top to protect it against the rain we get here in suburban Baltimore. I have it sitting on a perforated rubber pad placed on the wooden deck below the table. The rubber pad keeps it slightly elevated so that any water on the deck won’t be able to infiltrate the bottom of the feeder.I never used the AC power cord on my original feeder, opting to run that one off the 4 batteries installed as a backup power source. Without the WiFi capability, a set of batteries in that feeder surprisingly lasted between 6 and 7 months. I initially set up this PETLIBO without plugging it in to AC power as well, but WiFi use sucked down a new set of batteries over a week’s time. AC power is really needed for this bad boy, so I plugged it in.Raccoons? Yep. We got ‘em. I had inserted the old feeder into a wire mesh cage and then bungeed the assembly to the legs of my picnic table so they couldn’t tip it over, or get to the top to break into the goodies inside it. That worked perfectly.I’m using that same wire cage and bungee anchor system with the PETLIBO, but I took the top off of the wire cage so I could easily reach in and unscrew (1/4 turn) the top on the feeder to refill it. I liked this arrangement better, since I had to unbungee the old feeder/cage assembly and remove it from under the table in order for me to open the feeder for refilling. Unfortunately the damned raccoons were smart enough to quickly figure out how to unscrew the top of the PETLIBO and rob me blind! Now I put the top back on the wire cage to stop that from happening any longer. It takes me another minute to remove that wire cage top so that I can unscrew the top of the feeder, but again, I can live with that.The PETLIBO passes a larger size kibble than anything else I could find. For 2 years i had been slightly exceeding the largest kibble size permitted by the other manufacturer, I believe that was the primary reason why the plastic rotor fins broke off. The Purina Kit & Kaboodle feed that our colony really prefers didn’t feed well in that machine but the PETLIBO handles it perfectly.It’s very easy to program feeding schedules from the app. Is VERY flexible and can handle any schedule that I would ever need. It’s also very easy to change a feeding time or portion size and then change it back again tomorrow. It has a forced manual feed function where you select the portion size and then push “Feed”. Done. Instant gratification.The feeder sends “blocked outlet” messages when the feed doesn’t discharge into the 2 bowls completely. One reviewer complained about all these error messages and I would have to agree that they can be a pain. Better to know than not to know in my opinion. At our house, the raccoons usually take care of any evening plugging issues.You have the option of recording a verbal message to play when feeding and even how many times you want that message to play. The old feeder REQUIRED you to enter a voice message, even if you spoke not a word. Some people that failed to do this thought their feeder was faulty and sent them back.

Just remember when testing and setting the portion finger button, it is only giving 1 portion, my dog's meals were 9 portions. For testing purposes you can set the clock to go off while you are sitting there and watch it dump all the morning's food.

Please read if your cat food don't come out"", 'author': 'Siyu Bu', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""Short answer: this feeder works great and does NOT clog cat food.Ok. Originally I rated this feeder a one star. I was dumb as in blaming the feeder's fault on clogging food. For people have similar issues: simply push down the feeder plate a bit so that it is at the same level with the outlet where the food comes out. When it is not fit well, it is taller than the bottom of the outlet causing the clog. So push the plate down and connect it tightly (which is easy and takes minimal effort).The product is very reliable in all other aspects. Great quality, great appearance, and great function. Setting the feeding time is very easy and with the main container filled, it will last for almost months (for my cat). (with the machine being connected to power source). Dispenses food timely and accurately, with preset amount. The meal call option is really cute. Cat likes it. It is a great product with reasonable price (definitely worth it) and I would definitely recommend it to anyone else.--------------------------------Below is my original review, oh how embarrassing------------------------------------The kibbles got stuck in the outlet - 50% of the time I need to use my hand to unclog. This is very disappointing and defeats the purpose of its existence, which is to automatically feed the cat when I'm traveling out for several days. Unreliable product. I will add a picture showing the clogging issue when I get time.To be fair, the other features (like setting the feeding time and portions) are pretty nice/well made. Also it is made of good material so you don't need to worry about your cat eating chemicals diffused into its food. The voice call feature is pretty sweet as well. But I have to say that because of the clogging issue, this product is not a functional product despite its price.

I got it for my 3 month old Pomeranian. She’s food motivated and is eating a lot and everything lol So it’s important for me to know how much food she’s eating daily so that she doesn’t develop a weight problem. I think that this is the perfect size for her. It holds an entire small bag of Royal Canin Xsmall puppy kibble. She ate from it with no hesitation. Just like the matching waterer I bought from PETLIBRO, this feeder is also very easy to clean and seems pretty hygienic. I feel like these were well thought out, all except for the cord. The cord feeds out of the bottom right just like the waterer. The waterer offers a little cubby hole in the bottom to store the extra length in the cord and the feeder does not. Cords annoy me so this is a small issue, but nothing that I can’t work around. I also decided not to use the provided power block and opted to use a usb wall outlet because it just looks neater. I couldn’t get the Bluetooth initial set up to work so after some frustration, I just used the app setup and that was easy enough. The app is easy to use and self explanatory so I was able to schedule feeding with no hiccups. I haven’t setup any voice recording first because I hate the sound of my own voice but second, I worry that it will creep my puppy out. Maybe I will later when she’s less skittish of new noises. I see that some people have issues with their pets pushing over the unit to get food out. I’m not sure if they had an older model; the model I have has 2 latches on the top that click lock. They don’t seem bullet proof but look like they could withstand being knocked over and not opening. My spunky pup hasn’t tried that yet, but I’ll make sure to update my review if she does.

All of that SOUNDS good, but the truth of the matter is that this feeder is more trouble than it\'s worth, and could, potentially, be harmful to your cat. If you are already using 5G, forget about it, as the app does not work with 5G. I am not using 5G, so you\'d think I would be home-free, right? Nope.First of all, MAJOR design flaw: the push button to enable you to manually give an extra feeding is precisely at cat\'s-paw reach. My smarty-cat turned this contraption into a self-serve machine, doling out extra treats whenever this piggy-cat felt he deserved a little bit more—apparently he sees himself as VERY deserving. I looked up the manual on the Pet Libro website and there were ZERO instructions on how to disable this feature. So...I finally manually disabled it (removed the batteries) and was treated like a parcourse every morning in Pickles\' effort to get me out of bed to feed him (wasted dollar signs danced through my foggy brain as I slogged to the kitchen to do my master\'s bidding). After three days of THAT nonsense, I found out how to disable the feeder from the Amazon listing (only proving, once again, why I am NOT an Amazon hater). In reinserting the batteries, I also figured out the app my tech-savvy son-in-law had set up for me just TWO weeks ago when I inherited his beloved Pickles (my daughter is HIGHLY allergic to him—the cat, not my son-in-law). Pickles is also MY beloved boy, but I would prefer the cat feeder stave off Pickles\' impression of an incessant alarm clock with no snooze button and sharp claws.Pickles was quite unhappy that the button he had mastered no longer worked like an all-you-can-eat smorgasbord. I, of course, was like the proverbial cat who had swallowed the canary in that I had successfully outsmarted the cat. He DID manage to dislodge the food tray—first, the stainless insert, and then in his frustration and fury, he disengaged the white plastic tray COMPLETELY from the food canister. Another design flaw is that the lid just sits on top of the canister. I learned this the HARD way when I removed the batteries and kibble went flying all over the kitchen counter. Pickles thought Heaven was showering kibble from above and was gleefully scarfing it up until I scooped everything back into the canister. Once he started body-slamming the now-functioning—but cat-disabled canister—in his effort to get the kibble to fall, I had visions of kibble all over the floor, so I put packing tape over the top—which mars it\'s sleek lines (yet another, useless ""feature"").Today, the app said there was NO wifi connection—and the feeder DID NOT give Pickles his lunch this afternoon—in spite of the fact that human, cat, phone, and wifi have not been separated in nearly a week. What use is a feeder if you can\'t depend on it to actually FEED THE CAT? I followed all of the steps to ""reconnect,"" and I kept getting a message that cautioned me to be near the feeder. After my efforts at aiming my phone in front of the feeder whilst on the floor, didn\'t work, I placed it on the counter—still nothing. Finally, I fed the poor cat with his new puzzle feeder that I bought him for treats to engage his very active and inquisitive kitty brain—and slow down his proclivity for inhaling his food.It is now an hour and half after he was SUPPOSED to be fed and nothing has dropped. Thankfully, I was right beside my beloved boy and was able to stave off starvation (tongue-in-cheek). However, if you are buying this feeder to ensure your cat is being fed while you are at work or play—or even out-of-town for a day or two, FORGET IT! I call kitty abuse (and wasted dollars)! Pet Libro should be ashamed of selling a product with a poorly-designed app, faulty connectivity, and so many design flaws that it could actually be harmful to your lovable fur-ball, either through OVER-feeding or not feeding AT ALL.

Unfortunately we have become experts on automatic, timed pet feeders. Like most of us who the made the choice of an automatic feeder, we wanted to remove ourselves from the food situation. We have three kitties and two of them are relentless when it comes to food. As soon as we step into the kitchen, BAMM - there they were.For years we used the PetSafe automatic, timed feeders - one for each kitty. The problem with the feeders in which you set the time, some clocks run faster than others and so the food drops are not in sync. One feeder could drop 15 secs before the others. No matter how many times I adjusted the clocks, I could not get the feeders to sync. Now this wouldn’t be a big deal - except our piggy Purple kitty would inhale as much food he could when the first feeder would drop food and then go to the next one that dropped food. So we really, really wanted a feeders that dropped food at the same time.The other problem with the PetSafe feeders was the design - mainly all the edges. Our kitties were able to chomp down on the edges to move the feeders in such a way that it would drop food stored in the conveyor. Once our Blue kitty was able to figure that out - he would not leave it alone. So between the timing issues and Blue not leaving the feeders alone - we eventually had no choice but to put our 3 $100+ feeders away. Meaning - we were back in the feeding process of our kitties.To save our sanity, we decided to review the automatic, timed WiFi feeders and compared this one with the PetSafe WiFi feeder. There is about $80 difference between the two. The PetSafe one does have several features the Petlibro one doesn’t - Alexa enabled, certain smartphone notifications, amazon dash replenishment - but these were things that didn’t justify us paying $80 more. So we ordered three of these feeders.The feeders were delivered timely. A+ on the packaging of these feeders. We downloaded the APP and set up of the feeders was a breeze. I do agree with some other reviewers who say that the APP is not 100% intuitive - most likely because the Smart Life APP is not specifically for this feeder but for all the Smart devices in your home. The feeders were immediately found - we did not have to make any changes to our WiFi speed. Entered the PW for one feeder and then the other two appeared. In order for both of us to program, we had to set up a “Home” account. Next, we created a “Group” for all the feeders so you only have to make changes to the Group - instead of each feeder separately. It is like a waterfall when they drop at the same time! Music to my ears!Also, because of the sleek design, Blue cannot chomp his teeth into the feeder or move it. This has been a battle - perhaps I finally won???Purple kitty steals Blue’s food; Blue swipes GG’s. So we still have to “babysit” when they eat. But at least we know that they will be fed while we are out. The Meal Log is a nice tool - plus, we plan to install an ARLO in the kitchen when we are away for few days - just to make sure.Some issues:*** Although programmed, one day the 12:00 pm meal did not drop for one of our feeders. This happened before we created a GROUP - so hopefully this won’t happen again.*** APP is not intuitive and User Manual does not explain all the features that APP provides. For example, we just figured out that the numbers above the FEED button represent the number of portions you want to drop when you manually FEED. Before figuring this out, we were hitting the FEED button and nothing would happen.UPDATE: 5.24.21 - 1) So Blue has been able to get the top off the feeders so we have had to use blue painters tape to keep them secured. Blue = 2; human = 0.And for some reason, the schedule under the Group kitty feeders has disappeared twice. I think they would still drop food because the feeding schedule for each individuals feeder was still there. Who do you contact about this? The APP (Smart Life) or the Petlibro? I do hope Petlibro will develop their own APP and not rely on this 3rd party app.7.6.21 - UPDATE - So far so good. The only thing I truly recommend is watching the meal log if you are going to be out for a few days. We were away for a 36 hours and one of feeders did not go off as scheduled. We could manually feed, but it would not drop as programmed. And I do recommend putting a camera where the feeder(s) are so you can monitor.Also, GROUP schedule kept disappearing, but the individual schedules are still present. We kept the GROUP so we could manually feed all at once. I did contact the company about the disappearing GROUP schedule and was advised to reset the feeders. This is not a feeder issue; it is an APP issue. So needless to say, we were not impressed with the response.I am no longer having to wake up to feed the kitties in the AM and they have stopped ambushing us every time we walk into the kitchen.

I also set to 3 as the potion size as that’s recommended by the veterinarian.Aside from the feeding schedule there are two other options. 1. There’s a “FEED” button on the feeder to press (1 serving at a time), if you’d like. You’re able to lock this feature so the animals don’t figure out how to feed themselves after watching you press the button. 2. From anywhere! You can feed your animals any portion sizing you want. I’ve been hours away from home and still able to feed my animals a snack in between scheduled feeding times.The feeder came with the feeder itself, bowl set ups, and legs that they all rest on. There are 2 different heights for the animals to eat at (in the image I provided that is the tallest height). Also, it has two options of one or two bowls and is easy to change out, if needed. Super easy to clean and haven’t had an issue yet.I’d best recommend this for cats or small to medium sized dogs. No more than about 30 or so lbs.

I would recommend it to a friend.Since I can’t give half stars, I am rounding this MolyPet automatic pet feeder up to 5/5 stars because if it fits your needs, I think it is a solid option. Please note that even though I am listing several cons, they are relatively minor issues and are being stated just so people are aware before making their decision to purchase. The pros far outweigh the cons and that is reflected in my overall ranking.Here are some of my initial pros and cons:First the cons:1/ Ease of Use - The buttons are a bit difficult to see/read as the contrast isn’t very high. The time in the middle is lit up via LED and it would have been nice for the 4 buttons on the sides to use the same background lighting as well. It is difficult enough to see which button in a well lit room, impossible to see at all in the dark. That said, once this feeder is set-up, you don’t really need to touch things again until the time changes.2/ Ease of Use - Power switch is on the bottom of the feeder unit. This makes it difficult to turn it off (like when you are traveling with your pet) for a period of time. The instructions say to keep the unit upright at all times and to lift lift with two hands by the base. Therefore, if you need either a third hand or be able to feel around the bottom to find the power switch while supporting the base at the same time. It is easy enough to do if you have the feeder easily accessible, but I would have preferred this switch to be on the back of the unit instead of underneath.3/ Batteries - The instructions say specifically not to use rechargeable batteries. That is unfortunate as I hate to use and toss away batteries.4/ Batteries - Although it seems like you can use the feeder using just batteries, the instructions recommend using batteries only as a backup (if/when the power goes out). I am not sure how long the batteries will last if only using them as your power source, but not everyone has a place to plug in the feeder where they feed their pet(s) and this could be the only option.5/ Color - White seems to be the only color option available. I would like to see more color options - at least a black option. I am not sure how clean and bright this product will be after some time. I would guess, based off of other white products i have owned in the past, that at some point it will yellow and start looking a bit dingy.6/ Color - Cable is black while to unit is white. Not that big a deal, but sometimes it is nice that they match.Now the Pros:1/ Ease of Use - The lid is super secure! I have tried other types of feeders, and this is one of the most secure ones i have tried. Animals will not be able to get into the food bin once secured and you will easily know if it is locked or not. I can’t say the same for other brands.2/ Ease of Use - It is easy to see how full the food storage area is. When using other brands, I have run out of food without realizing it. At some point my pets are crying because they are hungry and I haven’t figure it out yet. With this bin, it is super easy to see when the food levels are low so that they never run out.3/ Small Detail - Love that the cable is using a standard cable connection (USB-C). It’s a small thing but it means that if the cable breaks or stops working I am confident i can find a suitable replacement easily. It also means I can swap out the cable for a longer or shorter plug if I wanted.4/ Configuration Options - really more than I need. Probably more than you need as well. Pretty standard across similar brands with somewhat identical interfaces and settings. If you have used a similar automatic pet feeder before you will probably recognize it. If you have never used one before it is pretty easy to use once you read the manual and understand what the letters stand for (e.g. SF = Slow Feed = time between individual feedings IF you set the feeding portions to be more than one. This help slow down a fast eating pet, by delaying before deploying the next portion. The number of feeding parts per feeding is set using the F = Feed Portion = Number of portions to output each feeding with each portion being 1/10 of a cup)5/ Capacity - Food bin holds 4L6/ Ease of Use - Communicates errors though you will need the manual to figure out what they mean (E-1 = the food outlet is blocked, E-2 = abnormal feeding, check for foreign or large objects)7/ Configuration Options - You can add an audio cue to let you pets know it is feeding time though the feeder noise is loud enough that my pets are well aware when the feeder is active and often come running if they are not staring out it waiting already.8/ Cleaning - Bowl can be removed easily to wash. Food storage bin can also come apart to clean.9/ Storage - Everything (bowl, bowl holder, plug, and manual) fits nicely in food bin when packing or storing unit when not in use.10/ Freshness - Lid includes filter to keep things fresh', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 12, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars works great for dog food', 'author': 'Amazon Customer', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""bought this product for supplemental dog food dispenser.

I use this to dispense the dry food, while I still manually feed the canned food for his AM and PM meal. I've had it for just over a month now, and it has not jammed or missed a feeding. Our kibble is about 1/2 diameter. It's easy to clean, lids locks on very secure, and holds a good amount of food. I like the transparent white so I can see when it's getting empty. I found it a bit challenging at first to set up the program, but after working with it for a little while I figured it out. When setting it up, the '1st' feeding is not necessarily the first of the day; it's the first one beginning with the time of day you are setting it up. So for example, for me the 1st meal to schedule was his mid-afternoon snack since I was setting it up after lunch. I absolutely love that I could set it up with different controlled portions for each feeding, and it allows for up to 6 meals/snacks per day.

Display panel off when plugged in.', 'author': 'Tunie C.', 'rating': 4, 'content': ""I bought this to feed my three outdoor cats while I was away for a week.When I returned home, I found it convenient to continue using it but I noticed that the display panel was not lit up. The directions are confusing, but there is a good video on YouTube that had me programing like a pro in just a few tries. I filled it with food and manually dropped the food several times with the different portion size feedings that you can program, to see how much food was dropped with each feeding. You can program 1 thru 6. I decided to program feeding size 6, 4 times a day. I used it for a week before I left to make sure it worked well. It did, right on time. I normally use a random size scoop to feed my cats. It is the blue scoop out of an oxy clean tub. I programed the feeder to drop four scoops a day. # 6 was one blue scoop. As I filled the feeder. I counted that it held 35 scoops. When I returned home there was a bit of food left that got dropped the next day in 2 feedings. The math says 4 scoops times 7 days=28 plus 2 more = 30. So, it fed 5 extra scoops over the week. The food was small so maybe more came out sometimes. OK. Today I decided to measure what 35 of my scoops actually equal. One litre is 8 scoops. Meaning the feeder does not hold 6 litres. It should have held 48 of my scoops. It holds a bit over 4 litres. I wish I would have measured it when before I returned it. All the above has nothing to do with why I returned it. When I returned from my trip. I noticed the display lights were out. I checked the wires and they were OK. If I tapped the unit, sometimes the lights would come on.When I unplugged it, the lights came on and stayed on. I have batteries in it. I read the directions again and it says that the lights should go out while running on the batteries. It is to save the battery power to last longer. You can push any button to turn them on.The lights should be on all the time when it is plugged in. Basically my electronics worked the opposite of what they should have. That's why tapping the front of it sometimes turned the lights on. I hit a button. That's why I returned it. I have found that when one part of an electric panel is faulty, eventually something else goes wrong. Also, there is no off/ on switch. With the battery back up, you would need to remove the batteries to turn it off which requires disassembly. But none of the cat feeders have an off switch that I have seen. The lid locks nicely. No chance of it falling off if the unit tips. I did not program the voice, but by the time I returned after a week, the cats could hear the motor engage and were there and waiting before the food fell. The food never got stuck and it always came out on time. I wish the display electronics had worked properly because everything else worked well for the month that I had it.Overall it is a nice unit."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 19, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars I wished the directions were simpler to understand.

I really liked this feeder until this happened', 'author': 'Sam Merrill', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I had a previous version from Wopet that worked great for over 4 years, so when it died, I went to this one. Purchased in November, and really liked the integration with the app, giving me alerts when food was low. It is a fairly small food dish, so for my dog I would regularly get messages saying it couldn't dispense all of the food because the food tray was full. Not a big deal, as I figured he was getting enough with twice a day feedings, which were all very simple to schedule via the app. Problem was that getting so many notices, I kinda stopped paying attention and just checked occasionally to see if I was getting a low food warning. Fast forward 3 months and I realize I have 4 days of alerts saying the feeder is jammed and realize my dog hasn't been getting his food. I empty out the hopper, everything seems fine, but the motor doesn't work right. Food is not jammed, and it can easily turn but seems like it is attempting to turn to dispense food, but fails and gives error that it is jammed, even if there is no food in the hopper.I understand that electronics wear out over time, but after only 3 months, this must be defective. I can't seem to find out how to contact support other than going through Amazon, and the return window ended last week :( I liked this feeder enough that I have ordered another one to hopefully have a better experience and see if I can get more than 3 months. New unit will arrive today.Editing after a great experience with WOPET support. After writing the previous review, I reached out to support and they were very easy to work with. Sent me a new unit.

I have had no issues at all and couldn't recommend a better auto-feeder. The app works great, the portions and timing are still perfect, I even had a chance to see it work off the backup batteries when the power went out during a thunderstorm and it went off without a hitch. The bowl clicks right out of the front for easy cleaning too. Stop searching and just buy it!ORIGINAL: My kitty previously had a bowl that allowed her to graze. She’d always been a grazer since I adopted her, even the shelter told me she didn’t have a regular schedule. Unfortunately, this led to her becoming overweight, so I decided it was time to shift to an auto feeder to help her lose some of those extra pounds.The feeder itself seems durable and overall looks nice and sleek. The setup was extremely easy, I had no issues getting it plugged in, connected to my app, and programmed. The instruction book was helpful for the few questions I had and it took me only about 20 minutes to get it set up and filled to start using. It requires three D batteries for backup in case the power goes out and they’re not included - so be aware you will also want to buy batteries with this purchase.The feeder easily dispenses my Iams brand kitty food and in the few weeks I’ve had this feeder have never experienced a jam. It dispenses perfectly on time and the correct amount of food each time. The portions vary based on what food you use so I recommend testing it a few times before finishing setup to ensure the right amount of food will be released with each feeding time. I simply dispensed different portions and put them into a measuring cup to see what was correct. The top is 6 liters so it holds plenty of food. I filled it to the top and it’s been about 2-3 weeks and it’s still got plenty of food in it. I like that the bowl is plastic not metal as well, so the falling food is not too noisy.As of now my kitty loves it. I didn’t set it to make any noise when dispensing but as soon as she hears the food fall into the dish she takes off, so I’m happy. She already appears to be losing some weight and her fur has even become softer with a regular feeding schedule. I’m very happy with my purchase and I highly recommend this feeder."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States April 7, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Easiest thing ever!', 'author': 'Brittany Martino', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'This automatic cat feeder is amazing and a life saver!

So she has to be fed multiple times a day, but we’re busy people. This automatic feeder is amazing! You can program it from an app on your phone. The app also lets you know when the food is running low and tracks that the food was successfully dispensed. So when I’m at work, I can check and make sure. But the best part is the voice message you can create with your own voice to call the dog to eat. Our dog tends to sulk upstairs in our bedroom when we aren’t home, but when she hears my voice coming from the machine, she runs downstairs to eat. It’s absolutely wonderful, and I highly recommend it! It’s changed our lives and her life for the better. Very easy to set up the app and record the voice.CONS: It stopped working after only 3 months!!!!!BUT: Customer service was excellent and they send us a new one, as it was under warranty.

Another thing I like is that the bowl is plastic and it easily is removed from the front for cleaning. I had another feeder that had a metal bowl and the kibble falling into it was loud and annoying when I was trying to sleep. The plastic muffles the sound better.

She meows incessantly for 45 minutes or more before meal times which annoys my dog into shriek howling with every meow and causes me to contemplate double murder. I\'ve only had this feeder for a couple days but so far it is working great! My cat is still learning that she must appeal to her new machine overlord for food, but she is already much better than she was. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and I will update my review if anything changes.PROS:- Easy set-up. It takes a few minutes but unless you\'re changing the schedule all the time for some reason, it\'s really not terrible. Some reviews claim you have to cycle through every time and portion to change something but that\'s not true. You can use the ""+"" and ""-"" buttons to navigate to the meal slot you want to change without starting from the beginning. Unused slots will have a time but if you set the portion to zero they will not dispense anything. This is probably obvious but it did confuse me for a second. I set mine to have 4 meals spaced 6 hours apart and it\'s been working like a charm.- No jamming problems even with larger kibble so far. The cat food I buy has larger chunks interspersed in with smaller kibble and I was worried that it might jam up the dispenser. So far it has been working just fine. It has a helpful sticker on the lid that shows you the largest kibble size it will accommodate and it seems to be accurate. I bought the 5L version which holds 4-5 lbs of food.- My devious cat has yet to figure out how to get extra kibble from it. The panel auto-locks so she can\'t press any buttons. I\'ve seen her stick her paw up the chute to dig around but she hasn\'t succeeded in any extra snacks yet as far as I can tell. It\'s only been a few days so time will tell if she will use her demon powers to beat the machine. I would suggest either putting this feeder on the floor or securing it in place because I suspect that my cat would be able to push it off a table and/or knock it over of it was empty enough. The weight D batteries alone might make it relatively stable to tipping though. I have not actually seen her move it yet but I remain wary because she is a larger cat at 14 lbs and generally a menace to society*.- It seems well-made and is very sleek and modern looking. Appearance is less important than function to me but it does look quite nice.- I like that there is a battery meter display even when plugged in. I intend to have it plugged in all the time but it will be nice to know when the back-up batteries need to be replaced.- After completing set-up, I decided to move the feeder and had not installed batteries in it yet. I was expecting to reset at least the time but was pleasantly surprised to see it did not reset at all. It was unplugged for all of 10 seconds so I can\'t attest to how long it can go without power or batteries before resetting the time. - A customer service rep from PETLIBRO messaged me before my product arrived with some helpful tips and reminder that they have customer service available 24 hours on week days if I need it and a 12 month warranty. I have not had a need to contact customer service but I thought the pro-active message was nice.CONS:- It is not clear from anywhere in the instructions what constitutes a portion. From my measurements, it seems that one portion is equivalent to approximately 1/8 cup. I am happy with this portion size but I wish it had been clear without requiring experimentation on my part.- In my opinion, the only truly poor feature about this product is the recorded message option (whether you intend to use it or not). Other reviews mention that the recording quality is very poor and I have to agree. It is very staticy and mine also makes a rhythmic rasping noise even when recording silence. I had no intention of using this feature anyway as the sound of a pin drop would probably send her scrambling from across the house if it meant food. The problem is that there doesn\'t seem to be a way to delete or turn off the recording without resetting the whole machine. I hit the record button by mistake during set-up, which is very easy to do, and I didn\'t want to start over. I ""bypassed"" it by hitting the record button quick succession to create as short of a recording as I possibly could. The quick blip of static when it dispenses food doesn\'t bother me but it is annoying you can\'t just turn this feature off all together. This is by no means a deal breaker to me but if having a nice recorded message is important to you, I would not recommend this feeder.- Not exactly a con but I prefer a shallow dish for feeding my cat. The bowl that comes with the feeder is deep but it is a nice bowl and I like that it has a tray that attaches to the feeder to keep it from being kicked around. Luckily her old shallow bowl fits nicely within the provided bowl and I haven\'t noticed any issues with spilling while doing this. Not a big deal but something to consider if it matters to you.*I promise that I actually love my cat very much! 😂 Picture attached.

It is fairly easy to tell when it is getting low.The cats have enough room so they can both eat with plenty of space.The camera is good enough to see the cats and make sure they are eating. I've tried the camera while I'm away from the house and it helped me not worry that the cats were getting enough food. The camera works well enough to see the cats at nighttime as well.The app was easy to set up on an iPhone. The interface seems intuitive. It has a lot of granularity on how much to dispense.The speaker on the feeder isn't very loud but as soon as it triggers the cats will come bolting from any room in the house.The only cons I have are:1) The food doesn't dispense evenly, one side always seems to get more. This isn't a problem for my cats but is worth mentioning.2) The app can be a little noisy with how many notifications it sends. It is sending notifications for sound alerts but those are usually people walking by. I'm hoping to figure out how to quiet that down without missing any cat related notifications.3) The video is grainier than the listing implied it would be. But it is still clear enough to check on the cats and the food dispensing.4) The app doesn't seem to pick up on low food warnings. It requires visually inspecting the feeder. I'm not sure if this is a bug or a lack of a feature. While it would be nice, the cats are very quick to let me know if they didn't get a meal.

Each unit is smaller than my last feeder, which allows for better portion control. What I don't like is that the machine can only give equal portions or larger portions to the bowl on the right, so if your cat who needs more food prefers the bowl on the left it's a problem. Also because there is no divider one cat can try to hog all of the food eating a little bit from both bowls, but that's a personal problem and may not be an issue with better mannered cats.I've also had problems with the low food warning. I have small, round kibble that rolls very easily, but even so, there was enough on the sides of the inside machine that even though I wasn't getting full meals delivered I wasn't getting a low food warning. The low food sensor either needs to be higher up, or the kibble needs to be better at getting dispensed evenly.My last complaint is that the USB cable provided was too short to reach the nearest wall plug.Otherwise, the camera is great. I love spying on my cats while I'm away. The portion sizes are nice and predictable with good control over total amount given. The frequency is easy to program.

It's a thoughtful touch, making mealtime a bit more personal for my feline companions.Connectivity: The WiFi connection is robust. I haven’t experienced any disconnects, ensuring that I always have access to the camera and feeding features.Firmware Updates: The company seems to be proactive in addressing software glitches. I noticed improvements in movement recording after a recent firmware update.Cons:Food Dispensation: There seems to be a design oversight where the food tends to accumulate on one side near the output shoot. This once triggered a warning of a blockage, which could be a concern for potential buyers.Camera Quality: The camera quality is decent, but not exceptional. It's adequate for monitoring, but if you're expecting top-tier image quality, this might not meet your expectations.Price Point: Considering the additional features, I'm not sure if the price increase for the camera version provides enough value over the non-camera version.Trust Issues: It took some time for my cats to adjust to this new gadget. One of the main reasons I got this was to ensure they didn't wake me up early in the morning for food. However, that habit hasn't changed.App Update & Cloud Storage: While I appreciate software updates, the recent one seems to emphasize their cloud storage offering. It's become somewhat inconvenient to access videos that aren’t on the cloud, which feels like a nudge towards a service I'm not particularly interested in.Final Thoughts:The PETLIBRO Automatic Cat Feeder with Camera does its primary job well, which is to feed. However, potential buyers might want to weigh the benefits of the camera feature against the price difference. While some features are commendable, there are areas of improvement that can enhance the overall user experience.3 month update: Still working well. Cats are now used to the feeder.

I am a cat person, and I've had cats before, and I know they can be left a few days by themselves with dry food - however, this cat is on medication that needs to be mixed into wet food, so I knew I needed to come up with a solution. I had heard of automatic feeders with ice packs before, and this one seemed to fit the bill quite nicely.First, I want to say this - when using this device, use common sense. You can't leave wet food in this thing for a week. Obviously it will not keep even with the ice packs, and there is even a warning in the instructions telling you not to do so. However, you can use this to portion out wet food for two-ish days, or dry food every day. Someone suggested freezing food into pucks to help the food last longer, and I do feel that helps a lot. I also purchased a separate set of ice packs so I can freeze one set while the other is being used. Still, I only portion out wet food for MAYBE 18 - 24 hours - I don't trust the food to be well enough to eat past that time. So again, use common sense.The next thing is the instructions do not use the best grammar, and so it makes it a bit confusing, specifically how to set up a feeder schedule for more that a day. Here is what I have learned - if you want the cycle to feed your pet TWICE A DAY (once at 9am and once at 9pm, for example), set the feeding times for two meal periods - one to 9am and 9pm - then don't set any more meal times, aka, leave the other four remaining times empty! (which, by the way, happens when you set those times to 12am) Then feeder will continually rotate at those two specific times - 9am and 9pm, or whatever two times you have set. The 6 meal times are for 6 specific meals out of a 24 hour period (such as if you want to feed your pet at 4am, 8am, 12pm, 4pm, 8pm, and 12am again). If you just need TWO meal periods (or three, ect), then just set two times and leave the other 4 blank. It took me a while to figure that out because the directions kinda/sorta say that, but again, the English isn't the best so actually using the machine is what helped me figure it out. I found that when setting Meal 1 to 9:30am, Meal 2 to 9:30pm, and Meal 3 to 10AM, and meal 4 to 10PM, the machine would override the separate meal periods at rotate at 9:30am and 10am on the same day. I hope this makes sense! This was the biggest stumbling block when getting this machine, but again, playing around with it helped me figure out the correct way to use it.As for the physical set up - I am not sure how people can't get this thing aligned, it's really rather straightforward, but perhaps I am missing something. I have taken it apart to clean it and put it back together a few times at this point and have had no issues with realigning it.Another tip - every time you turn on the machine, you have to reset the current time, but your meal periods will be saved. This may be annoying to some but I don't mind having to set the current time every time, it's very easy to do so. And the battery life is great, too!This thing has come on handy many times since I purchased it. If I want to go out for a late night and want to ensure the cat is eating at her specific time, I can turn it on and put the food in one slot, and just use it for one night. It gives me peace of mind knowing she is getting fed!And for those complaining about 'whisker fatigue...' If you are using this for one to two nights, your cat will be fine, I promise. My foster cat has eaten meals out of this thing with no problem. If you were using this around the clock, I can understand why the cat would get whisker fatigue - but again, every cat is different.Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase!"", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 7, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Update: I bought a second one!', 'author': 'Davina', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'I thought I would come back and update my review now that I\'ve had it for a little longer. I have to say that, of all the autofeeders I\'ve tried, this one seems to be the best. I actually just got a second cat, and so I bought a second feeder!-The ""ding"" is still very quiet; however, the rotation of the plates is a little bit louder, and my cats have learned that this means food.-I really like that you only have to set the schedule once, and as long as you keep it turned on, you won\'t need to reset it.-My (original) cat is trying REALLY hard to break into it and it seems indestructible. I keep the back of it (with the clip) flush against the wall so he can\'t get to the part where it\'ll actually open.-I was able to snag extra ice packs (search Amazon for iPettie ice packs and they should come up). I wish they were a little smaller because they take up a big portion of my freezer. However, I\'m grateful to have them. A work-around is to only use one ice pack at a time, & keep it underneath the wet food portions. (Of course this limits you to only serving 3 wet meals instead of 6)I\'m going to keep my original review below this for context, but overall: I\'m more impressed than I originally was! Great product!************************************************************(old review)Note that I did not get this product for free in exchange for a review. [There\'s nothing wrong with that, but worth mentioning as I\'ve been researching autofeeders & selected this one intentionally.]Pros:-Very good size. I have a very smart cat who likes to break other autofeeders & so far he hasn\'t been able to move this around or hack into it.-Easy to disassemble for cleaning.-The lock screen is really great. My cat climbed & sat on top of this & it didn\'t affect the programming at all.-The feedings are exactly on time. I\'m used to the CatMate dials, which are never accurate.-The on/off switch on the back is very helpful to save battery power when not in use. I\'ve only had for a few days so I can\'t speak to battery life just yet. It\'s great to have a charger as a backup as well.Cons:-The company needs to sell individual ice packs so you can rotate between feedings without a 6 hour delay. (My cat mostly eats wet food so this is important for me.)-The depth of each dish seems to be awkward for my cat, a 10lb domestic longhair. He\'s had to sit ontop of the feeder in order to get food that has ended up in the corners.-Plastic dishes as well; I wish they were metal.-The screen is not very responsive to touch, at least for me. I find myself having to slam into the buttons in order to adjust the time, which then leads to speeding past the number I need, which then leads to me cussing at 5 AM.-My cat has a very good ear, but the rotation/""ding"" to announce the feeding is way too quiet. He\'s missed most of his feedings so far by 10-15 minutes, which isn\'t the end of the world, but it\'s still not ideal. Luckily I have a camera in my kitchen with a microphone, so I can call him in if he misses it.I have a few more weeks before my return cut-off date, so I\'m going to give this a few more days to see if it\'s worth all of the cons. It\'s definitely better than all of the CatMate feeders for sure!', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States March 24, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Behold, The Glorious FoodShrine', 'author': 'Asher Taylor-Dawson', 'rating': 5, 'content': '... At least, that\'s what my cat seems to think! When it\'s nearly time for the next bowl, he lies there staring at his Donut Frost with the glittering eyes of absolute faith (even though he\'s mostly blind).Personally, I think it looks like a cute little Roomba that serves catfood.Either way, it\'s a lifesaver. Easy to set up, program, and disassemble for cleaning. If your pets like food as much as Merkah (my 15yo orangeboi) does, they\'ll figure it out pronto.The latch in the back is simple but secure, and the control unit has a lock feature that pets are unlikely to defeat. Larger dogs might be able to bash their way through the upper shell, so if you\'ve got larger dogs around, you\'ll probably want to set this feeder up where they can\'t reach it.The whole thing charges via USB-C cable. One with a 90-degree connector is included (though you could use a regular one in a pinch, just maybe not with food in the tray). The package does not include a ""wall wart,"" but most of us have about a million of those lying around anyway.Update: the battery in this thing is HUGE, and I have yet to see it run out. The longest I\'ve let it run without charging is 7 days, but that\'s a really long time anyway.When the feeding cycle begins, the feeder emits a little beep. I\'m not sure how, but Merkah knew without prior instruction that the beep meant FOOD (maybe he learned it from the microwave??? 🤔). A few days in, he practically tapdances for joy when he hears it.On a more sober note: Merkah has developed a serious illness that causes insulin overproduction (which, in turn, can lead to severe hypoglycemia, as we discovered the scary way). This means he needs to be fed every 3 hours around the clock to keep his blood sugar relatively steady.I would go on getting up every 3 hours all night if I had to in order to keep him safe, but not having to is really helpful.Knowing that FoodBot (as we\'ve taken to calling it) is on the job lets me sleep easier (read: lets me sleep, period, bc I find it directly to fall asleep again once I wake up) and it keeps potentially life-threatening medical emergencies at bay.I was worried that the openings might be sized in a way that leads to whisker fatigue, but so far they seem to be fine. Because I\'m feeding wet food, I take the tray out every day and wash it, so I\'m not terribly concerned about the potential for feline acne related to plastic bowls.Being mostly blind also doesn\'t appear to make it harder for Merkah to use this feeder (if anything, it\'s easier, because it\'s big and hard to miss).The smoothly-curved sides also help Merkah lap up every molecule of his precious wet food, which I\'m sure he appreciates, and limits spills (Merkah is a sloppy eater), which I definitely appreciate.The included ice packs keep wet food chilled overnight — by morning they\'re mostly thawed, but still fairly cold (I do have AC in the bedroom where the feeder is stationed overnight). I help them out by freezing pre-measured ""pucks"" of wet food for the last 3 servings in the cycle. (Merkah is also apparently happy to eat the still-frozen pucks, as I discovered when I loaded the tray backwards).Whether you have a pet with medical issues that require frequent small feedings, one that pesters you for food all the time, or one that could use some help with portion control, the Donut Frost is a solid choice.There are cheaper feeders on the market, but the balance of features (especially the ice packs and USB recharge) makes this one a winner if you can afford it.TL;DR: a really good multi-serving feeder with custom-fit ice packs.

After 2 weeks, she would only take treats from it, not food. We think part of the issue is the depth at which the food sits, which requires her sticking her entire head in the opening (about 2” deep). We’ve switched her to shallow dishes to avoid whisker fatigue and we don’t think she can eat from this machine without causing a lot of annoyance to her whiskers, which is why she’ll only eat treats but not food from it. We have a British Shorthair who for medical reasons needs to be on wet food but is a picky eater and not very good motivated. We’ll have to switch to finding a different food cooling solution that also accounts for potential whisker fatigue problems. There was no way of contacting the seller to ask for advice or troubleshoot the issues so we’ll have to return it and sort out a different solution.I’d add that the ice packs sort of require a backup set if you’re planning on using this for more than 6+ hours.

So far, I love this feeder. I bought three. I’m really happy and relieved because I had been looking at automatic feeders for over a month and ended up buying some that I had to return because my cats were able to get extra food out of the food dispenser. Two of my cats are a little chunky, so that was one of my main concerns when getting another.Pros:-Very secure! My cats haven’t been able to get food out of the top and they haven’t been able to get food out of the hole where the food dispenses. They stick their paws up there and try to get food out and so far, no extra food has fallen out. I even saw another review that said their cat learned to knock the feeder around and extra food would fall out, so I was nervous about buying these, but I haven’t had that problem. I even shook the feeders around to test it and it was fine. But if you do have a very determined cat, I’d suggest getting some Velcro stickers for the bottom of the feeder to hold it in place so it can’t tip over, because they’re on the smaller side.-Food dispenses at pretty much the same time. I bought three for my three cats and all the food dispenses at the same time, if not one or two seconds apart.-Very sleek and modern look. Most automatic cat feeders are 4 liters or bigger, so I like that this one is smaller and doesn’t take up so much space.-Rechargeable batteries. You can choose to keep the feeders plugged in and charging while using them, or you can unplug them and have them off the charger.-Battery life. I’ve had the feeders off the charger for almost four weeks now and two of them are at 40% and one of them is at 50%. So the battery life is really good.-App is very user friendly and easy to use. Also, easy set up, as long as you switch your WiFi over to 2.4ghz. Once you set up the feeders, you can switch back to 5ghz.I was having an issue at first with the app. The food would dispense on time throughout the day and then it wouldn’t dispense again starting the next day. I kept having to go back in the app and manually turn them back on. I was so confused. I thought I had them set to all days of the week cause in the app it says “repeat” and then lists all the days of the week. I contacted the customer support and they were super helpful and they told me I need to actually tap the days of the week in the app to get it to repeat lol🤦\u200d♀️ so they work great now and dispense at the right days/times.There are many more pros, but those are the main ones that stood out to me.Cons:-If you have multiple feeders, I wish there was a way in the app for the “feed now” button to dispense food from all feeders at the same time. Or I wish there was a way when you’re setting up your pets schedule, you could select all feeders and set them all up at once. Instead you have to do each feeder individually.-Portions. The portions are a little weird. They go by 1/24ths. I feed my cats blue wilderness and each portion is approximately 30 pieces of kibble. Sometimes it’s a little more, sometimes it’s a little less. Nothing major though. I do wish they had better portion options. I like to give my cats a “late night snack” and the first portion is too small, but the second portion is too much.These are definitely not deal breakers though. The pros far outweigh the cons.

I started feeding them tiny portions throughout the day to keep the food theft to a minimum, but I a) didn’t have the energy to keep up with that, b) the time to keep up with it, and c) the desire to carry on with that. It made being away from home so difficult. So I opted to get these feeders. Initially I wasn’t looking at the WiFi version, but being able to control the feeding amounts and schedules on my phone seemed well worth the money, and it absolutely has been.I can adjust the amount and frequency as needed, even feed on demand if a cat needs. They both only tried to break into their feeders once; they both failed and never tried again. I’m using these wirelessly as I have extremely limited space and outlets, and the change lasts an impressive amount of time - my cats are fed every few hours and the charge lasted around a month. When they both dipped to 20%, I plugged one in and it was done charging within a couple of hour- I truly expected it to take most of the day to get back up to 100%, but was pleasantly surprised at how quick and simple it was.These feeders have 100% been worth the money. They give me peace of mind that my cats will have food, regardless of if I’m working, away, or having a bad day and am struggling to do basic tasks. If you’re looking at the simpler version, I would definitely urge you to reconsider for the WiFi model! The app is very user-friendly and simple, and I’ve not encountered any bugs.I do wish there was a platform built to have the food bowls sit higher for the cat’s comfort, but all in all, I’m super impressed and very pleased with this purchase.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 30, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Nice', 'author': 'Ray Bush', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Works well.

My orange cat likes to pretend he never got fed and tries to convince me it never happened but the app doesn’t lie like little bad orange kitties. The only issue I came across, probably my own fault or lack of knowledge, was getting connected back to the WiFi when it was disconnected. I had to delete the feeder from “my devices” and go through the whole set up process which takes about 3 minutes. Not really that big of a deal.

The only con I’ve experienced is the programming guide - it took several efforts to figure out how to program it but once you’ve figured it out it’s relatively easy. It uses a 24-hour clock - I found that writing down the meal number, the time and the servings (before starting to program) greatly simplifies the process.

Wells', 'rating': 4, 'content': ""After researching 3 feeders, I decided this one seemed the best. It was also the cheapest of the 3. We ordered this to feed our cat when we are away for long weekends. It seems very solidly constructed. The lid locks on very well – there is NO WAY a cat could get the lid off if it is properly put on. Theoretically, maybe, a large dog could use their teeth to unlock it, but this seems VERY unlikely.The storage spot is huge – I think it could hold enough food to feed our cat for a month.The feeding mechanism is essentially a small roulette wheel that the food drops into as it turns. Each spot is a “portion”. The portions are pretty small, large dog kibble wouldn’t really work with this feeder. It’s for standard size cat kibble. The “trial and error” process to find the right number of portions for your animal is not hard – I guessed 6 portions, it was too much, I changed to 4, it was just right for the twice a day feeding.You can set up to 6 feedings a day. We only use two so simply turned the others to “Off”. We plug our into the wall, which means we needed to move the feeder to a spot with an accessible outlet. You can also put batteries into it and I would image them would last a long time given the minimal power usage but we're not using that option.The set-up isn’t hard. I’ll admit, I did open the instruction booklet (but only for a moment). The instruction booklet is small with only a couple pages as there really isn’t that much to need to tell you.Total set-up time was about 10 minutes; 15 at most. The clock is in 24 hour time.I think I read in a review that someone said their cat figured out how to hit the ‘manual feed’ button to feed themselves. You can lock the control screen to prevent this from happening. If your cat can both figure out how to unlock the controls and feed themselves, then your cat is an absolute genius.So why only 4 stars? After about a week, the clock on our feeder started falling behind. It would lose a couple hours every day. Then it would sometimes freeze on the same time for half the day.I emailed the customer service contact explaining the situation. They replied back the next business day saying they would ship a new feeder. They shipped a new one; no need to return the old one; no need to deal with amazon's return process. We’ve now been using the new one for over a month and it is working great. Must have been a fluke electrical issue with the first. The customer service person even reached back out via email a few weeks later to make sure everything worked for us. One of the best customer service experiences I’ve had from an amazon seller.Overall, would definitely recommend.

Potato chips, spicy corn chips, even pickle slices- if she can get to it, she will eat it, or try to eat it. Any time we give her more than a tiny handful of kibble, she will invariably devour it so fast that it comes right back up. Our much slower eating boy cat had been very tolerant of her Hoovering up his food as well as her own, so we started feeding them in different rooms so he would get more than a small portion of food before she inhaled it all.As she can\'t be given more than a teaspoon\'s amount of food at a time (any more, and you will find yourself stepping in a pile of it on the carpet a few minutes later) we decided to look for a bowl that could slow down her eating. This bowl had decent reviews and was not expensive, so we gave it a try. It appears to be well-made, and not too difficult to clean- the channels in it are big enough to get a brush into.At first, ""Hoover"" was not pleased with this new food receptacle. At ALL. She could smell and see all those tasty nuggets that she usually made disappear within thirty seconds, but she couldn\'t get at them easily any longer. I could see she was frustrated, so I put down a few pieces of kibble right next to the new bowl. She gulped down this small bit of food, then looked at me, wanting more. I then tapped the bowl and ""showed"" her the kibble sitting in the channels of the bowl.At first, she walked away from this strange thing. Maybe her ""real"" bowl would re-appear, and she wouldn\'t have to deal with this kibble puzzle dish. She came back and checked out the new bowl again, and managed to get a few pieces of kibble out of it. I noticed she was shoving the bowl around with her paw on the cushion-y ""placemat"" we have under the cats\' food and water. She got a few more pieces of kibble.She never flipped the bowl over entirely, which is what I was waiting for (and dreading.) The placemat we have keeps the bowl from moving around very much, so I can\'t attest to the bowl\'s ""suction"" (?) effectiveness. I just checked out the underside of the bowl, and don\'t see any suction cups or anything, but we keep their bowls on the cushy placemat anyway, so it\'s not going anywhere.She returned to the strange object that was holding her food hostage again and again, and each time managed to get out a few more pieces of kibble. I just checked the bowl, and there are about a dozen or so pieces of kibble sitting in it, which is amazing to see, as she is so strongly food-motivated.The bowl just arrived this afternoon, so I can\'t attest to its effectiveness in the long-term, but it seems to be a success so far. It has broken the feeding time cycle of giving her a tiny bit of kibble, her begging for more food, giving a tiny bit more kibble, then begging again, etc. I\'ll report back after a week or so. Hopefully, this new bowl will continue to keep our Hoover-cat on a lower setting.Edit: it\'s been about four days of her using the new bowl. As we saw that she had been leaving about half of the kibble in the bowl after eating (unheard of with a regular bowl) we increased the minimal amount of kibble we gave her to her entire morning portion. A day or so ago, if we checked the bowl after she appeared to finish eating, and there would be about seven to ten nuggets of kibble left. When she begged later, we just tapped the bowl. She got the message: if she wanted more kibble she would have to extract it from the bowl. ---- We noticed yesterday after giving her the evening\'s kibble allotment that the new bowl with its challenging channels was completely empty. She has figured out how to get all of the kibble out of her new bowl. After we fed her this morning, sure enough, she got all of the kibble out of it. But the bowl is still a success, as it has really slowed down her eating. In a way, she is now eating like a normal cat- and not like a fur-covered Dirt Devil.

We feed twice daily, kibble in the morning, and canned + kibble + water in the evenings. In the mornings, Watson would scarf his kibble down so quickly, he would, a short time later, harf it up on the rug. We tried feeding the wet course in the mornings, same issue. It became so frequent, his upchuck showed signs of blood due to stomach acid scarring his esophagus (confirmed by a vet exam) Free-feeding wasn’t an option, because the booger has little self-control and would overeat and get tubby.This product takes a little effort and time to get the kibble out, and for us, it solved this feeding issue. It slows down the feeding time, just enough, so he keeps the food down. We provide these bowls for all our cats, and only use them for the morning (dry) meal. In this way, there is little competition; all is fair and equal.This model holds about 1/2-cup of (kitty-sized) kibble. We feed them about 1/3-cup at the morning meal. The description claims it holds up to 3/4-cup, but that amount doesn’t sink into the channels far enough to slow down consumption. They’ve been used daily for over a year, and are holding up quite well. The bowls have grippy feet on the bottom, which minimizes movement. But the boogers tend to push the bowls around, as they work the channels for food. It’s not uncommon to find a bowl across the kitchen 8-10 feet away after feeding. Sometimes, we gotta hunt them down looking under tables and chairs.The bowl is made of plastic, and frequent cleaning is needed. The cats use their little tongues (and sometimes paws) to get the food out, and as such, the bowls get kinda gross with saliva buildup after a couple of feedings. They are nicely dishwasher safe, though. Hand-washing requires brief soaking. A metal or ceramic version of this bowl would be better.I’m not a mind reader, but I see clues that our cats would prefer their kibble in a regular bowl, without the obstacles of this “puzzle dish.” That said, they seem to tolerate it, as all the cats have an identical bowl during this feeding time. When given a choice between the regular and puzzle dish, they go to the regular, as it may be less work to feed.One last tip, after adding kibble to the bowl, we find it best to jiggle it back and forth, so the kibble settles down into the channels. Otherwise, when left piled in the center, the little booger can still scarf down the kibble at a rapid rate.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States March 19, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great Product!', 'author': 'Kevin', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""This product works great to slow down my cats eating.

I\'d been shoving Petramalt at her for a week. During this time, she had her annual visit with the vet. All was in good working order, except she had lost some weight. The vet wanted to run a senior blood panel. Considering this cat is the crankiest cat in the kingdom, I felt there was no point. She\'s 13 ½ and could rip my jugular if she chose to, and she would if I tried to pill, shoot, or otherwise administer life-supporting care. Besides, the blood test had been run the year before, and again, all was well. We returned home, and she continued to puke. She only eats kibble, which I found myself stepping onto day or night.Ok, I thought, I must take her back for the test. In the interim, I decided to google cat vomit. I found that ""cat eating too fast may cause vomiting,"" along with the need for a raised platform for better digestion. Further research suggested a slow-raised feeder. My cat is a Hoover if allowed to be. Searching on Amazon, I found many such feeders, but I decided on this one based on its tilted base. Oh, I knew I would return it. I knew it wouldn\'t work. None of these self-help ideas work, I thought negatively. She probably won\'t even eat out of it because it\'s ""different."" Well, it\'s been a week, and she has not thrown up once, and I have not heard the crunch of a massive glob of kibble as my heal made contact.

They just have a look about them that says: well-designed, well-made - and healthier for your cat. When I received them, I was actually shocked! They EXCEEDED my expectations! They hold a can of Friskies perfectly, and there is almost no mess. But here’s the part that astounded me: it says they’re dishwasher-safe, but I’m the dishwasher in my house, so after my cat’s first meal I did the routine thing - I put the bowl in the sink to soak before washing, and when I came back 20 minutes later I picked up the bowl and poured out the water - and virtually EVERY bit of food rinsed out! The one or two little specks that were left LIFTED RIGHT OFF the surface when I touched them with my fingertip. I gave it a final rinse with hot water - no soap; no scrubbing - and there I was, holding a clean bowl.I’m not kidding you; it IS that easy. (Yeah, every once in a while I throw in a little detergent to knock off any stray microbes that might have wandered in, but I really don’t think it’s necessary.)Just put some hot water in the bowl, give it 15 minutes, then a final rinse under running water and maybe a light swipe with a paper towel. That’s it. Really. Truly. Clean.Now what I want is a bowl for ME that I don’t have to wash.....(maybe I could just borrow hers for a light snack - a little chicken salad maybe? Or some deviled ham on toast points?) Do you think that - ᴍᴀʏʙᴇ - she might let me share her bowl?? 😗 👀All kidding aside, I would give these Kitty City bowls SIX stars if I could. Maybe the material they’re made of ISN’T revolutionary; maybe the technology has been out there for years and I just haven’t noticed. (I don’t get around much.) But that’s beside the point. These bowls are beautiful, to the eye and to the touch. And they make eating a healthier experience for your cat. So look at them again - and if you love 💕 your cat, buy a set. Buy two. That’s what I did - and I only have one cat. But I noticed today that they have a set in pastels now, and they’re gorgeous..... so I’m gonna buy a set. Do I really need six bowls for my one cat?....Maybe not....but maybe I can use a couple of them to display art objects. Maybe I can display a couple of them AS art objects....I would add a picture if I could, but my lap seems to be inhabited at the moment, and that imposes certain limits....maybe I can add one later. I didn’t know I would be revisiting this site today, but I’m glad I finally got back here. I bought my Kitty City bowls in January, about ten months ago, and I knew in the first week that I had to come back here and write a review for one of the BEST PRODUCTS I’ve ever seen. Of any kind. I’m sorry I took so long to write this. But I’m glad I’m here now, so that I can wholeheartedly, without reservations, recommend to you a product that I believe to be perfect in what it strives to do. I cannot think of any aspect that needs improvement.You might think that spending an hour to write a review about the bowl that I use to feed my cat is a somewhat trivial way to spend my time. I would not agree. In these days of cost-cutting mass-produced ecology-destroying poorly-made disposable trash, we all have a duty to stand up and shout when we find a product - ANY product - that does exactly what it’s supposed to do, and is also aesthetically pleasing.I’m hoping that Amazon won’t yank this review. They had to pull a couple of mine in the last four years when I wandered off the beaten path, offering my opinions in areas that didn’t strictly conform to product review, and I can understand that. I do tend to wax enthusiastic when I find a product that is so far above what is usually considered “good enough “.

The bowl has a notch to join it to the dispenser, so it stays where it should be.I like being able to adjust the portion that gets released up to 6 times per day. In fact the amount can be adjusted differently for each of the 6 feeding times. I very much like that it runs on three D batteries [or can be plugged in]. It makes it much easier to put the dish where I need it since I\'m not having to rely on an electric power source.There are just two things that my cats aren\'t crazy about with this feeder. First, there is a speaker. I guess to record ""Here kitty, come eat"" or whatever your cats respond to, but it freaks my cats out. And there\'s no volume adjustment. So, I recorded a brief clip of silence so that resolved that. Second, cats don\'t like their whiskers touching anything when they eat. Most prefer a wide top dish and the diameter of this bowl is just a little on the small size. It\'s not a tiny bowl, it is a reasonable size, but with it right next to the dispenser, it seems to annoy at least one of my cats. I would suggest getting rid of the speaker or add volume control and maybe make the bowl an oblong shape or a little larger.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 21, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Works great!', 'author': 'Sandy', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'This has helped me out so much!

I decided to try this gravity feeder along with the waterer. I previously purchased larger ones from a different company for a much steeper price and love it. I wanted the same feel for less money and went with these. For the price, you really do get a great deal. It serves the purpose I needed for sure.Packaging:This item, along with the waterer, were tossed in a large box, way too big for what these were. There was hardly any protection and the items got tossed about. One even came detached from it's base. Thankfully nothing broke but it was poorly packaged nonetheless.Item:I purchased the smaller sized feeder since I have minimal space outside. Setting this up with the waterer fit perfectly. The colors on the bases were nice and the plastic seemed sturdy enough. The price is great and does what you will need it to do. The opening of the base is a decent enough size that the outdoor cats have used it and its low enough that smaller animals can probably eat from it as well ifyou have another type of pet at home.Cons:Only have 2 minor complaints really.1- I really have with the feeder is that the top doesn't lock in too well to the base. If you shift it in the slightest it falls out. There were no directions, but its not rocket science. I tried screwing it in and out several times to be sure I was doing it correctly. I was. It just doesn't sit well no matter what I try, Could be because it fell out and jostled around during shipping.2- Although a gravity feeder, it doesn't really flow that easily or naturally when the base has been eaten. You kind of have to shift the whole unit forward to get the food to come back out the bottom. It's a little annoying because it defeats the purpose but it still saves on time for me and with the price, I tend to overlook it.Bottom Line: Worth it.

One is a dachshund mix, the other is a poodle mix. Neither weigh over 15 pounds. Before we got the dachshund we just used an old style feeding bowl for the poodle, but after the dachshund came along, the food started disappearing a lot faster. I\'m going to tell you what I have learned about these gravity-type feeders. Before having these little two dogs, I had a full-blooded chow-chow who lived nearly 14 years. He absolutely hated these feeders. And hated the watering ones even more. He was a fairly big chow-chow, about 85 pounds, picture of health. It was pretty simple to see that his big furry head had trouble getting his face down in these types of feeders. The watering one didn\'t release enough water for him to drink. I ended up buying him a big pan to put his hard food in and a large open water bucket. I would recommend those for anyone with dogs bigger than medium size.This feeder earns its five stars. I love dogs as much as anyone does, but these two small dogs we have now are the only indoor dogs I\'ve ever had. They are both messy. I don\'t mean with potty issues or anything like that, but I mean with eating and drinking. The dachshund is especially messy. He pushes the food out of most feeder\'s bowls. He then plays with the food. Then he gets mad at the poodle for drinking ""his"" water and shoves the watering apparatus so it spills.This feeder stops him from doing it. We had bought a cheap feeder and watering bottle at a department store. The fault lies in the depth of the bowl. Not how deep it is or how much it holds, but the distance from the spout of the bottle to the bottom of the bowl. Then you take into consideration how wide the opening is. The cheap one we had bought allowed too much food to come out, kind of gave an avalanche impression. Dachshund had a field day with it. Not so with this one. The spout opening isn\'t near as big as other feeders I\'ve used and the bowl is far enough away from the spout that it doesn\'t allow the food to pile up.Having said that as a very positive feature, it\'s most likely why other people are having problems with the food not coming out without a nudge. If you have a dog or dogs that likes to make a mess with food, this is the perfect feeder for them. I don\'t know much about the microban, but we wash our feeder and watering bottle weekly. Not surprisingly, I paid pretty much the same price for the cheap feeder as this one. In comparison, this one is worth its price easily.

I had previously bought a little cat house to shelter them from weather and give them a nice clean spot to sleep, but I converted it to their kitchen and filled the canister to the top and I was absolutely surprised to see that there were a few kernels of dry cat food left when I got home from my out-of-town visit. With the second canister, I decided to put my dog, who is on a diet and eats low-calorie food, I decided to see how it would be if I didn’t have to regulate his intake every day, and again, to my great surprise, he only ate until he was full and then walked away until the next day. Absolute miracle on both applications. Highly highly recommend. if you have ants that might get into the food, consider laying down a bunch of cardboard under the feeder and put a very little amount of granular triazide and wet it down really good and then put the cardboard down and then the cat house and feeder on top. I never, never use products such as triazide, but I had to make a choice as to whether my cats were going to be able to eat, or if the cat food was going to be ruined from an infestation of ants.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 25, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Simple design, easy to clean and fill', 'author': 'Robert J.

We didn’t need wifi, cameras, or anything else that could break or malfunction or complicate things - just a feeder where we could set the time and the portion size, so this fit the bill.Pros:• It was easy to set up the clock and set schedules and portion sizes while following along with the manual.• I also like that pretty much every piece that touches the food can be washed including the container and the silo that pushes the food out. You have to wipe out the chute manually since it’s attached to the electronic part which is no big deal.• It runs without the batteries in, but I like the battery option for going away just in case the power ever went out when we weren’t home.• I unplugged it once to add a longer power cord and thought I would have to reset the whole program, but after about 20-30 seconds it automatically maintained what I had already set, which is nice.• Our cat isn’t a food fiend so hasn’t tried to break into it, but the twist lock on the top seems like it would prevent that pretty well.• One portion is about 1/8 cup of our kibble. The small 3L size holds a surprising amount of food and using the smallest portion size 2x per day, should last at least a month’s worth or more.• We’re transitioning our cat from the dry food she had at the shelter to one that’s a bit more high quality and using this has made it a breeze to transition slowly over the month - I simply added her old food at the bottom, a mix of the two in the middle, and the new food on top, so each day a little bit more of the new food gets mixed in.Cons:• It’s a little rough to take the container off the base, and twist the silo part off as well - I split a nail in the process! Someone with mobility issues or neuropathy would likely have a tough time.• Wish the cord was a little longer. It’s a bit under 5ft and I needed 6 to secure it along the wall and make it look nice where I wanted to place it, so I had to buy a longer one. It’s also a USB-C to USB-A cable which makes it bulkier where I need to plug it in.• Wish it had a “skip” or “hold” option. While learning our cat’s habits I sometimes manually dispensed a portion but would forget that the timed one was still coming, so she’d get extra.Misc/Overall:Didn’t use or need the recording feature, since our goal was to not have her associate us with food, so can’t speak to that. I bought a pack of desiccant packets from another brand which I’ll plan on swapping out once per month. I’d also recommend manually dispensing a portion or two the first time you fill it/whenever you refill it until the food comes out, because the first one came out empty - the food needs to make its way down the chute, and then it works fine.

Initially, I had some issues with this unit. The battery compartment in the original base had springs that were the wrong size rendering the battery backup function unusable. But PetLibro stood behind its product and replaced the faulty base. Problem solved. I just had another issue with the notification function in the app not working properly and, although I had to go through two different customer service representatives, I finally got that issue fixed as well. The fact that PetLibro stands behind its products and follows up on active customer service cases is a huge plus in its favor, huge. You just don't see actual customer service much anymore. Although I had a rocky start, I now wouldn't hesitate to purchase another PetLibro product in the future.The unit, which is now fully functional, is great. My kitty is all about food and cannot self regulate her eating. I already had gotten a PetLibro non WIFI feeder back in the spring. I decided to upgrade in order be able to virtually monitor the feeder functions from my tablet. This newer WIFI has a low food warning, so you don't have to manually check the food reservoir frequently, a tighter, better closing lid (better to keep critters out), the ability to provide snacks and change meal times/sizes remotely without having to touch the physical unit itself (which is much easier and less of a hassle) and it also enables you to increase/ decrease the volume on announcements. The food reservoir has a nice large capacity. I've had zero issues with kibble jamming up the despenser mechanism. The app itself is a little rough around the edges and does need some improvements. The interface is somewhat clunky and primitive both in appearance and layout but I get the impression that the company is working on that. The one thing I really think needs to be improved on the feeder is the design of the food bowl. It doesn't lock into place and is too easily nudged out of position sometimes causing food to be dispensed on the floor rather than in the bowl. But, overall, it's a very good WIFI enabled feeder.

She started barking at us from 5 am. Not so bad on a work day but on the weekends it got old fast. By switching to this automated feeder she has not begged us for her morning feeding.We feed her a Hill’s ID prescription food which comes in a non round / uniform shape, about 12-14 mm wide. I was a bit concerned that it would plug in the feeder but it has not plugged yet. Sometimes you can hear it struggling a bit as it turns and kibbles readjust. Turns and provides a consistent amount of food. For our food we set it at 6 and it measures out just under one cup of food. Their 7 setting gives just over one cup. Considering that the sizes I’d say it is fairly accurate and consistent in measurement of food.I have it plugged into our block rocker usb so not running off batteries. If the power goes off there is enough power to keep it running. It has the option to put batteries in but I opted out cause I can envision not checking these and having them corrode.The build quality is good.

I haven\'t had any problems yet with food jamming or ""ghost"" notifications like low food levels or low battery like other reviews had mentioned. I haven\'t really needed the lock feature quite yet. My cat is smart, but not that smart. I also do really like the backup battery power. We lose our power quite a lot.

We are out of the house traveling a lot. Our last one (Antblocker) had a camera and it was nice to have live video confirmation of our pet actually being fed rather than just relying on the app to tell us. I usually set up an auxiliary camera anyway. So maybe it won\'t be an issue.I am noticing that portion size may be a tiny bit inaccurate. My pictures show the lowest possible amount to be dispensed 1/12 cup. Seems it may be more towards an 1/8 C or more. Our cat has been used to 3 small portions of dry food throughout the day (including 1/3 can of wet twice a day). I wish there was a smaller portion size. We may have to drop to twice a day.

However, a new job for my partner and I has left us not being able to get home for their 6pm feedings on time.I had considered automatic feeders for awhile but as I have said, with 3 cats.. 3 feeders is expensive and I didn’t want to invest in anything ridiculously overpriced or something that wouldn’t work consistently.I did not need an app or any of that nonsense really. I already have cameras in my house so I didn’t need the extra gizmos and gadgets. I was specifically looking for: affordable, consistent portion control, something that can stand up to two very determined kitties and simplicity.PROS:You have the option to set up to 6 meals per day.Portion size works as follows: 1 portion is about 1/8 cup — this was consistent for the 10 times I tried it and will update if that changes.It deposits the food fairly timely..It is rather quiet, not a whole lot of whirring and noise, my cats were completely unbothered but mine think anything that gives them food is well worth any risk.It’s easy to set up. If you were born before the year 1980 then maybe not so much but I’m a millennial and this was not an issue at all. If you could work a Nokia, you can work this.It’s easy to take apart. There’s two eject buttons on either side of the main tank that allows you to pull it apart for cleaning.It can use batteries or wire adapter. I like this feature cause I’m not willing to buy a ten pack of D batteries every few months no thank you. I do like the idea that if the power goes out however, it won’t reset everything since it had battery reserve.It is KITTY PROOF - my little bean has been messing with this thing since getting it a few hours ago. Let me preface this with she is a small girl, 9lbs. Tiny but mighty and never lacking in the determination department. She is VERY familiar with puzzle bowls and to her this was no exception.. however, much to her dismay she has been unable to pry it apart. Thank GOODNESSYou can probably use other bowls for this if you slightly elevate the tank. Literally put a dictionary under it and slide a maze bowl underneath. TA da.CONS:There’s no extra gadgets like camera or WiFi app etc. so if that’s your thing this isn’t for you. Likewise, the voice recorder sucks. Don’t even bother. You may as well use a can tied to a string to get your message across.The user interface aka “the buttons” — this was annoying because it’s like setting an old digital alarm clock in that you have to cycle through ALL SIX FEEDING TIMES whether you’re using them or not to get to your clock/time whatever. This was mainly an issue for me while setting the time cause I accidentally set it to AM instead of PM, oops, silly me, that’ll be a quick fix— OH NVM I have to cycle allllll the way back through to switch that, if you click too fast then you gotta cycle again. How fun.This was the only reason I docked a star but past that, it’s fine.You can manually give 1 portion, I don’t think there’s a way to make it more than that, also it will still give their designated feeding portion even if you give a manual one so keep that in mind.I will continue experimenting with this and update if I find anything new or fun to talk about, enjoy the video of my kitty being very disappointed.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States April 9, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Love it.

More feedings in restricted smaller amounts haved helped her overcome daily purging. (ick) I\'ve never owned an automatic feeder and I bought this PetLibro version because it allows up to 10 scheduled feedings a day and all 7 days may be customized individually, though I only use the copy day feature at this time to make all days the same. What I find very valuable is that each scheduled feeding may be sized from 0-4cups of kibble(food) in 1/12 increments, so 48 different feeding sizes that I measured to be very accurate cup for cup. Understand the physics of it though because smaller the kibble(size of dry food) the more accurate the measurements. If you want to know exactly how much kibble is dispensed then (clean and dry all pieces that come in contact with food first), assemble dry parts, fill container, dispense 2-3 full cups first to ensure the internal air pockets are removed to ensure accurate measurements, then dispense and measure each of the levels from 1/12th to 12/12ths and compare it to your normal feeding size. KNOW THIS - medium to large kibble won\'t function well in this feeder. I intend to continue using the small kibble Purina Puppy Chow and I feel good about the feeder\'s size precision. At $70 the price is right as I didn\'t feel the need to spend more to add a camera to the feeder. Install and use of the mobile app was very easy and straightforward. I like option to record my own voice that plays prior to each feeding. What\'s cool is that everyone in my family may record a ""Come Eat"" audio and you can manually change which ones plays anytime you want from within the app. Oh, and the app may be installed on multiple phones so that everyone in the family can keep track of feedings and alerts. I did learn that the app\'s auto find of device from phone only works AFTER plugging in the PetLibro feeder. I installed the 3 \'D\' size batteries first and lights appear as does minimal functionality however Bluetooth signal is off until the device is also plugged in. Some reviews reported that they couldn\'t connect phone to feeder however I believe this was their issue. The batteries are designed for back up only when loss of power occurs - the device turns off wifi and BT to conserve energy to ensure dog gets fed. The food container holds 5 days of food for my 50# Labradoodle and the device has indicator light and an app push notification to indicate time for food refill. Food container looks to have a good tight seal to keep food fresh. There is also a desiccant pouch that should be replaced every week or month - though I\'ve read that desiccant\'s may be renewed in microwave or dehydrator.

She meows incessantly for 45 minutes or more before meal times which annoys my dog into shriek howling with every meow and causes me to contemplate double murder. I\'ve only had this feeder for a couple days but so far it is working great! My cat is still learning that she must appeal to her new machine overlord for food, but she is already much better than she was. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and I will update my review if anything changes.PROS:- Easy set-up. It takes a few minutes but unless you\'re changing the schedule all the time for some reason, it\'s really not terrible. Some reviews claim you have to cycle through every time and portion to change something but that\'s not true. You can use the ""+"" and ""-"" buttons to navigate to the meal slot you want to change without starting from the beginning. Unused slots will have a time but if you set the portion to zero they will not dispense anything. This is probably obvious but it did confuse me for a second. I set mine to have 4 meals spaced 6 hours apart and it\'s been working like a charm.- No jamming problems even with larger kibble so far. The cat food I buy has larger chunks interspersed in with smaller kibble and I was worried that it might jam up the dispenser. So far it has been working just fine. It has a helpful sticker on the lid that shows you the largest kibble size it will accommodate and it seems to be accurate. I bought the 5L version which holds 4-5 lbs of food.- My devious cat has yet to figure out how to get extra kibble from it. The panel auto-locks so she can\'t press any buttons. I\'ve seen her stick her paw up the chute to dig around but she hasn\'t succeeded in any extra snacks yet as far as I can tell. It\'s only been a few days so time will tell if she will use her demon powers to beat the machine. I would suggest either putting this feeder on the floor or securing it in place because I suspect that my cat would be able to push it off a table and/or knock it over of it was empty enough. The weight D batteries alone might make it relatively stable to tipping though. I have not actually seen her move it yet but I remain wary because she is a larger cat at 14 lbs and generally a menace to society*.- It seems well-made and is very sleek and modern looking. Appearance is less important than function to me but it does look quite nice.- I like that there is a battery meter display even when plugged in. I intend to have it plugged in all the time but it will be nice to know when the back-up batteries need to be replaced.- After completing set-up, I decided to move the feeder and had not installed batteries in it yet. I was expecting to reset at least the time but was pleasantly surprised to see it did not reset at all. It was unplugged for all of 10 seconds so I can\'t attest to how long it can go without power or batteries before resetting the time. - A customer service rep from PETLIBRO messaged me before my product arrived with some helpful tips and reminder that they have customer service available 24 hours on week days if I need it and a 12 month warranty. I have not had a need to contact customer service but I thought the pro-active message was nice.CONS:- It is not clear from anywhere in the instructions what constitutes a portion. From my measurements, it seems that one portion is equivalent to approximately 1/8 cup. I am happy with this portion size but I wish it had been clear without requiring experimentation on my part.- In my opinion, the only truly poor feature about this product is the recorded message option (whether you intend to use it or not). Other reviews mention that the recording quality is very poor and I have to agree. It is very staticy and mine also makes a rhythmic rasping noise even when recording silence. I had no intention of using this feature anyway as the sound of a pin drop would probably send her scrambling from across the house if it meant food. The problem is that there doesn\'t seem to be a way to delete or turn off the recording without resetting the whole machine. I hit the record button by mistake during set-up, which is very easy to do, and I didn\'t want to start over. I ""bypassed"" it by hitting the record button quick succession to create as short of a recording as I possibly could. The quick blip of static when it dispenses food doesn\'t bother me but it is annoying you can\'t just turn this feature off all together. This is by no means a deal breaker to me but if having a nice recorded message is important to you, I would not recommend this feeder.- Not exactly a con but I prefer a shallow dish for feeding my cat. The bowl that comes with the feeder is deep but it is a nice bowl and I like that it has a tray that attaches to the feeder to keep it from being kicked around. Luckily her old shallow bowl fits nicely within the provided bowl and I haven\'t noticed any issues with spilling while doing this. Not a big deal but something to consider if it matters to you.*I promise that I actually love my cat very much! 😂 Picture attached.

Also because there is no divider one cat can try to hog all of the food eating a little bit from both bowls, but that's a personal problem and may not be an issue with better mannered cats.I've also had problems with the low food warning. I have small, round kibble that rolls very easily, but even so, there was enough on the sides of the inside machine that even though I wasn't getting full meals delivered I wasn't getting a low food warning. The low food sensor either needs to be higher up, or the kibble needs to be better at getting dispensed evenly.My last complaint is that the USB cable provided was too short to reach the nearest wall plug.Otherwise, the camera is great.

However, as others have pointed out, it is too easy for a smart cat to figure out how to dispense the food. The first problem is that the only button that makes any sound when touched is the lock/unlock button - attracting the cat's attention. My cat just keeps touching it, probably because it beeps, then when he holds his paw on it for about a second, it's unlocked Then its a simple matter to touch the dispense button and he is rewarded with with a jackpot of food.Petlibro could have easily made it so it took touching and holding 2 buttons at one time to lock/unlock. I don't think any cat would ever figure that out.I've taped around the buttons area to add space to prevent touching.

Here’s a breakdown of my experience:Pros:Consistency: The feeder has been working as expected and I've had no major functionality issues.Voice Recording: One of the highlights is the ability to record a personal message. It's a thoughtful touch, making mealtime a bit more personal for my feline companions.Connectivity: The WiFi connection is robust. I haven’t experienced any disconnects, ensuring that I always have access to the camera and feeding features.Firmware Updates: The company seems to be proactive in addressing software glitches. I noticed improvements in movement recording after a recent firmware update.Cons:Food Dispensation: There seems to be a design oversight where the food tends to accumulate on one side near the output shoot. This once triggered a warning of a blockage, which could be a concern for potential buyers.Camera Quality: The camera quality is decent, but not exceptional. It's adequate for monitoring, but if you're expecting top-tier image quality, this might not meet your expectations.Price Point: Considering the additional features, I'm not sure if the price increase for the camera version provides enough value over the non-camera version.Trust Issues: It took some time for my cats to adjust to this new gadget. One of the main reasons I got this was to ensure they didn't wake me up early in the morning for food. However, that habit hasn't changed.App Update & Cloud Storage: While I appreciate software updates, the recent one seems to emphasize their cloud storage offering. It's become somewhat inconvenient to access videos that aren’t on the cloud, which feels like a nudge towards a service I'm not particularly interested in.Final Thoughts:The PETLIBRO Automatic Cat Feeder with Camera does its primary job well, which is to feed. However, potential buyers might want to weigh the benefits of the camera feature against the price difference. While some features are commendable, there are areas of improvement that can enhance the overall user experience.3 month update: Still working well. Cats are now used to the feeder. So they come running when they hear the feeding announcement."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 28, 2023', 'is_verified': True}]"

We didn’t need wifi, cameras, or anything else that could break or malfunction or complicate things - just a feeder where we could set the time and the portion size, so this fit the bill.Pros:• It was easy to set up the clock and set schedules and portion sizes while following along with the manual.• I also like that pretty much every piece that touches the food can be washed including the container and the silo that pushes the food out. You have to wipe out the chute manually since it’s attached to the electronic part which is no big deal.• It runs without the batteries in, but I like the battery option for going away just in case the power ever went out when we weren’t home.• I unplugged it once to add a longer power cord and thought I would have to reset the whole program, but after about 20-30 seconds it automatically maintained what I had already set, which is nice.• Our cat isn’t a food fiend so hasn’t tried to break into it, but the twist lock on the top seems like it would prevent that pretty well.• One portion is about 1/8 cup of our kibble. The small 3L size holds a surprising amount of food and using the smallest portion size 2x per day, should last at least a month’s worth or more.• We’re transitioning our cat from the dry food she had at the shelter to one that’s a bit more high quality and using this has made it a breeze to transition slowly over the month - I simply added her old food at the bottom, a mix of the two in the middle, and the new food on top, so each day a little bit more of the new food gets mixed in.Cons:• It’s a little rough to take the container off the base, and twist the silo part off as well - I split a nail in the process! Someone with mobility issues or neuropathy would likely have a tough time.• Wish the cord was a little longer. It’s a bit under 5ft and I needed 6 to secure it along the wall and make it look nice where I wanted to place it, so I had to buy a longer one. It’s also a USB-C to USB-A cable which makes it bulkier where I need to plug it in.• Wish it had a “skip” or “hold” option. While learning our cat’s habits I sometimes manually dispensed a portion but would forget that the timed one was still coming, so she’d get extra.Misc/Overall:Didn’t use or need the recording feature, since our goal was to not have her associate us with food, so can’t speak to that. I bought a pack of desiccant packets from another brand which I’ll plan on swapping out once per month. I’d also recommend manually dispensing a portion or two the first time you fill it/whenever you refill it until the food comes out, because the first one came out empty - the food needs to make its way down the chute, and then it works fine.

Initially, I had some issues with this unit. The battery compartment in the original base had springs that were the wrong size rendering the battery backup function unusable. But PetLibro stood behind its product and replaced the faulty base. Problem solved. I just had another issue with the notification function in the app not working properly and, although I had to go through two different customer service representatives, I finally got that issue fixed as well. The fact that PetLibro stands behind its products and follows up on active customer service cases is a huge plus in its favor, huge. You just don't see actual customer service much anymore. Although I had a rocky start, I now wouldn't hesitate to purchase another PetLibro product in the future.The unit, which is now fully functional, is great. My kitty is all about food and cannot self regulate her eating. I already had gotten a PetLibro non WIFI feeder back in the spring. I decided to upgrade in order be able to virtually monitor the feeder functions from my tablet. This newer WIFI has a low food warning, so you don't have to manually check the food reservoir frequently, a tighter, better closing lid (better to keep critters out), the ability to provide snacks and change meal times/sizes remotely without having to touch the physical unit itself (which is much easier and less of a hassle) and it also enables you to increase/ decrease the volume on announcements. The food reservoir has a nice large capacity. I've had zero issues with kibble jamming up the despenser mechanism. The app itself is a little rough around the edges and does need some improvements. The interface is somewhat clunky and primitive both in appearance and layout but I get the impression that the company is working on that. The one thing I really think needs to be improved on the feeder is the design of the food bowl. It doesn't lock into place and is too easily nudged out of position sometimes causing food to be dispensed on the floor rather than in the bowl. But, overall, it's a very good WIFI enabled feeder.

We feed her twice a day and had someone checking in on her but wanted her morning feeding to be automated.Thus fit the need perfectly.When we switched to feeding our dog from once a day to twice a day, she got trained to expecting her food at that time or even earlier. She started barking at us from 5 am. Not so bad on a work day but on the weekends it got old fast. By switching to this automated feeder she has not begged us for her morning feeding.We feed her a Hill’s ID prescription food which comes in a non round / uniform shape, about 12-14 mm wide. I was a bit concerned that it would plug in the feeder but it has not plugged yet. Sometimes you can hear it struggling a bit as it turns and kibbles readjust. Turns and provides a consistent amount of food. For our food we set it at 6 and it measures out just under one cup of food. Their 7 setting gives just over one cup. Considering that the sizes I’d say it is fairly accurate and consistent in measurement of food.I have it plugged into our block rocker usb so not running off batteries. If the power goes off there is enough power to keep it running. It has the option to put batteries in but I opted out cause I can envision not checking these and having them corrode.The build quality is good. If I were to an add anything I would say to add loops or other provision for straps. It is light so my dog can knock it over. I have seen others strap it down and loops incorporated into the sleek design would make it perfect. I’d say design it to strap to a 25 lb Olympic plate or two 20 lb plates would be nice.

I haven\'t had any problems yet with food jamming or ""ghost"" notifications like low food levels or low battery like other reviews had mentioned. I haven\'t really needed the lock feature quite yet. My cat is smart, but not that smart. I also do really like the backup battery power. We lose our power quite a lot. It\'s good to know at least our cat will be fed for at least as long as the batteries last before we get home.I think the only thing that I\'m gonna regret is not buying the one with the camera. We are out of the house traveling a lot. Our last one (Antblocker) had a camera and it was nice to have live video confirmation of our pet actually being fed rather than just relying on the app to tell us. I usually set up an auxiliary camera anyway. So maybe it won\'t be an issue.I am noticing that portion size may be a tiny bit inaccurate. My pictures show the lowest possible amount to be dispensed 1/12 cup. Seems it may be more towards an 1/8 C or more. Our cat has been used to 3 small portions of dry food throughout the day (including 1/3 can of wet twice a day). I wish there was a smaller portion size. We may have to drop to twice a day. And, the desiccant pouch in the lid is a nice touch but may be overkill. I don\'t plan on buying desiccant packs for a pet feeder.Overall and so far, it seems it\'s gonna be a good product.

However, a new job for my partner and I has left us not being able to get home for their 6pm feedings on time.I had considered automatic feeders for awhile but as I have said, with 3 cats.. 3 feeders is expensive and I didn’t want to invest in anything ridiculously overpriced or something that wouldn’t work consistently.I did not need an app or any of that nonsense really. I already have cameras in my house so I didn’t need the extra gizmos and gadgets. I was specifically looking for: affordable, consistent portion control, something that can stand up to two very determined kitties and simplicity.PROS:You have the option to set up to 6 meals per day.Portion size works as follows: 1 portion is about 1/8 cup — this was consistent for the 10 times I tried it and will update if that changes.It deposits the food fairly timely..It is rather quiet, not a whole lot of whirring and noise, my cats were completely unbothered but mine think anything that gives them food is well worth any risk.It’s easy to set up. If you were born before the year 1980 then maybe not so much but I’m a millennial and this was not an issue at all. If you could work a Nokia, you can work this.It’s easy to take apart. There’s two eject buttons on either side of the main tank that allows you to pull it apart for cleaning.It can use batteries or wire adapter. I like this feature cause I’m not willing to buy a ten pack of D batteries every few months no thank you. I do like the idea that if the power goes out however, it won’t reset everything since it had battery reserve.It is KITTY PROOF - my little bean has been messing with this thing since getting it a few hours ago. Let me preface this with she is a small girl, 9lbs. Tiny but mighty and never lacking in the determination department. She is VERY familiar with puzzle bowls and to her this was no exception.. however, much to her dismay she has been unable to pry it apart. Thank GOODNESSYou can probably use other bowls for this if you slightly elevate the tank. Literally put a dictionary under it and slide a maze bowl underneath. TA da.CONS:There’s no extra gadgets like camera or WiFi app etc. so if that’s your thing this isn’t for you. Likewise, the voice recorder sucks. Don’t even bother. You may as well use a can tied to a string to get your message across.The user interface aka “the buttons” — this was annoying because it’s like setting an old digital alarm clock in that you have to cycle through ALL SIX FEEDING TIMES whether you’re using them or not to get to your clock/time whatever. This was mainly an issue for me while setting the time cause I accidentally set it to AM instead of PM, oops, silly me, that’ll be a quick fix— OH NVM I have to cycle allllll the way back through to switch that, if you click too fast then you gotta cycle again. How fun.This was the only reason I docked a star but past that, it’s fine.You can manually give 1 portion, I don’t think there’s a way to make it more than that, also it will still give their designated feeding portion even if you give a manual one so keep that in mind.I will continue experimenting with this and update if I find anything new or fun to talk about, enjoy the video of my kitty being very disappointed.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States April 9, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Love it.

More feedings in restricted smaller amounts haved helped her overcome daily purging. (ick) I\'ve never owned an automatic feeder and I bought this PetLibro version because it allows up to 10 scheduled feedings a day and all 7 days may be customized individually, though I only use the copy day feature at this time to make all days the same. What I find very valuable is that each scheduled feeding may be sized from 0-4cups of kibble(food) in 1/12 increments, so 48 different feeding sizes that I measured to be very accurate cup for cup. Understand the physics of it though because smaller the kibble(size of dry food) the more accurate the measurements. If you want to know exactly how much kibble is dispensed then (clean and dry all pieces that come in contact with food first), assemble dry parts, fill container, dispense 2-3 full cups first to ensure the internal air pockets are removed to ensure accurate measurements, then dispense and measure each of the levels from 1/12th to 12/12ths and compare it to your normal feeding size. KNOW THIS - medium to large kibble won\'t function well in this feeder. I intend to continue using the small kibble Purina Puppy Chow and I feel good about the feeder\'s size precision. At $70 the price is right as I didn\'t feel the need to spend more to add a camera to the feeder. Install and use of the mobile app was very easy and straightforward. I like option to record my own voice that plays prior to each feeding. What\'s cool is that everyone in my family may record a ""Come Eat"" audio and you can manually change which ones plays anytime you want from within the app. Oh, and the app may be installed on multiple phones so that everyone in the family can keep track of feedings and alerts. I did learn that the app\'s auto find of device from phone only works AFTER plugging in the PetLibro feeder. I installed the 3 \'D\' size batteries first and lights appear as does minimal functionality however Bluetooth signal is off until the device is also plugged in. Some reviews reported that they couldn\'t connect phone to feeder however I believe this was their issue. The batteries are designed for back up only when loss of power occurs - the device turns off wifi and BT to conserve energy to ensure dog gets fed. The food container holds 5 days of food for my 50# Labradoodle and the device has indicator light and an app push notification to indicate time for food refill. Food container looks to have a good tight seal to keep food fresh. There is also a desiccant pouch that should be replaced every week or month - though I\'ve read that desiccant\'s may be renewed in microwave or dehydrator.

My cats switch on and off what sides they eat at, so I figure it equals out.Was slightly challenging to set up the meal schedule/portions, but now that I have the hang of it, it’s super easy if I need to adjust it for some reason.Overall, if it keep operating as expected, this is life changing!

At the risk of being overly dramatic: this feeder has literally changed our lives. Whenever we go away, which certain times of year is somewhat frequently, I have someone who comes to feed Kitty her wet food (I have also had an automatic water fountain for several years) and check on her once a day. Because I cannot get someone in more than once a day, I would leave a perpetual feeder full of dry food that would be available to Kitty 24/7. But my tiny-frame, 15 lb kitty is a glutton. Normally when we are here, she is on a strict diet of 1/4-1/3 cup per day of dry food. When we'd go away I'd figure it's only 2 or 3 days several times a year of her having a free-for-all with the dry food, it won't kill her. Well, when we went away a couple months ago, I came home to copious amounts of cat vomit EVERYWHERE... all dry food. I realized for her health and my sanity, I had to find a better option. I researched all of the feeders under fifty dollars (which I felt was a reasonable limit to spend) I found on Amazon and this one had the most positive reviews. The only thing that was annoying was that neither the ad, nor any of the reviewers, stated exactly how much a serving is and, as I said, my Kitty's diet is strict so I made sure I added that detail to my review. 1 feeding dispenses 1 TBSP. kibbles. I'm sure this will vary slightly depending on the size and shape of your kibble. For us, this is perfect. She gets 1 serving every 6 hours except her 8pm serving, which was always her dry food dinner time, she gets 2 servings to total just under 1/3c per day. I thought I would only use this feeder when we went away like I did the perpetual feeder, but this has been so wonderful, it is our new permanent daily feeding station. We never have to worry now about late evenings when Kitty would have to wait for food or if there was a last-minute need to spend the night away and poor Kitty not getting her coveted kibbles untilbover 12 hrs late. She also seems happy to get small portions throughout the day and night rather than all at once and bonus: no more vomiting because she only gets 1-2 TBSP at a time. Another concern was that she is a feral rescue so she is VERY skittish about noises, movements and any new or moved object so I was worried she might be too terrified of it to eat from it. But, after running away for a couple of seconds then approaching cautiously the first 2 or 3 dispenses, her kibble addiction overrode her fear. By day 3, this girl already learned the schedule. She now appears before the bowl about 3-5 min prior to dispense time and waits for it. When we went away last week, my cat sitter messaged she would not be able to arrive to give Kitty her wet food in the morning and would not be there till later that afternoon, so I went on the app on my phone from hundreds of miles away, and was able to immediately dispense Kitty a serving of kibble and also adjust the afternoon feeding to keep her within her total allowed for the day.

I'll have to relocate her feeder closer to a plug as I really like the feeder. The other thing is the directions that come with it do not specify the feeding amount. I thought the number feedings indicated how many times I wanted to feed them, when in fact its the amount it dispenses. I had it set on 1, 2 & 3 and 1 dispenses maybe 10 pieces of kibble.

At her evening feeding time I was near the feeder and nothing happened. I checked the app and it said that the feeding had occurred, but it had not. I then pressed the button in the app to manually feed, and it displayed a message saying it was feeding, but again nothing happened. I opened it and rummaged around in the “spout” where the food gets ready to be dispensed, and then it started working normally. This is really problematic - every other feeder I’ve tried will alert you if there is a jam and feeding isn’t happening. I have no idea how many feedings she missed, and now I’m not confident this will actually feed as programmed. And apparently there’s no way to discover whether there’s a problem unless you sit and watch whether it’s dispensing, which defeats the purpose. It’s really frustrating - up until now this was the best feeder I’d tried, but after only a few months, it seems unreliable.Original review:I’ve had 3 different automatic feeders for my very food motivated cat, and this has been the best one and the cheapest! The Wi-Fi and app control is a great feature that makes change the schedule really easy. My cat also needs to go on a diet because the last feeder’s internal mechanisms broke down/stretched to create larger portions than intended. This one feeds about 1Tbsp at a time, so I can set it up to feed her tiny portions throughout the day so she’s not hungry and (mostly) doesn’t bother us for food.

I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 mainly because of my having to rename my 2.4ghz network name to have ""-2.4"" at the end of the name. This caused me some grief reconfiguring a few devices. My router has 2 network names, one for 2.4ghz and one for 5ghz. This feeder only works on 2.4ghz. If your router only has one network name and it\'s 2.4ghz, then you shouldn\'t have issues (""shouldn\'t""). This is not a shortcoming of the product, but I also had to modify the spaces between the paddles that rotate and push the feed into the chute.

They never say what ""it"" is. Well, it\'s plastic.I suppose that without the rubber feet, it\'s all dishwasher safe. It\'s two parts. The top locks into the bottom and can be easily detached. I just push the feeder up to the wall.It does have deeper grooves to slow down aggressive eaters. My orange cat wolfs down all food and then vomits. About the only thing that helps him is to call his name every two bites. We\'ll see over the next 3 weeks if this works. If it doesn\'t, I\'ll come back and adjust my review as always.This is white and it is smooth. It does feel like glass. It does hold enough kibble. I think the grooves are too deep for wet food. It has a small footprint. The cat design is subtle, not in your face.

The auto-feeder comes with a basic shallow bowl, and my cat always inhales his food from it. I raised the auto-feeding mechanism up off the ground and put this below the dispenser, and that seems to work well.The only problem we have is that this thing slides all over the place. While he's trying to get at the second half of his food, he slides his dish halfway around the room. This really needs a no-skid bottom on it to prevent this from happening.

If you have a whisker shy cat I do suggest trying it with caution.The bowl top/head of the cat does twist on and off- so it's not a solid piece but rather 2 pieces that can be taken apart. With that being said; they don't easily loosen, fall apart or anything and the head does twist into the correct position tightly without a problem.The idea of the design - a cat/feline shape, is incredibly cute.

I was so excited when I came across the HIXX Automatic Wet Food Cat Feeder.This feeder allows me to sleep in during the weekend. I work really early during the weekdays so my cat expects breakfast that same time on the weekends. If I don’t get up and feed him at EXACTLY 5:30 a.m., he will meow, walk on me, and then put his nasty kitty butt in my face. With this automatic wet food feeder, it’s now very quiet and peaceful in the morning and I can now sleep in.This feeder is also great for traveling so my pet sitter only needs to visit every other day during the winter months. (I’m not sure how long the ice will last during the summer.) If you also plan on using this feeder for traveling, I recommend that you also purchase an inexpensive camera to go with it just so you can make sure there aren’t any user or feeder errors. The other day, I hit the feed button and nothing happened so I hit it again. Since I only had one meal in it, it went past the food. I wouldn’t have known his dinner flew by if I didn’t have a camera pointed at it. Having a camera to go with this feeder will give you a peace of mind.I really like that this automatic feeder has cord/battery option and a voice recording feature. However, the first time my cat heard my recording, it startled him and he ran away. Now he seems fine with it and hopefully will get trained to walk over when he hears my lovely voice.I also really like the way the bowls are designed since it makes it easy for my cat to reach all the food. When he eats from his other bowls, food tends to stick in the corners. That’s not the case with this feeder. In addition, since the bowls are so smooth and food doesn’t stick to them, it makes it easy to wash.Setting up the app and connecting it to the feeder was easy; however, the app could use some improvement. As it is now, you can’t change the date or time format. The date is confusing since it’s DD-MM-YYYY and the time is military. The directions say that the format will follow how your phone is set up, but that is not the case.As others mentioned, the cover is not easy to remove. When I first tried opening it, I struggled (when I had it on my lap).

It is the first one we have tried. After reading reviews for other feeders, I wish I had purchased one that had 6 feeding times instead of this one that only has 4 feeding times. However, we have worked with this one and it is working great so far! It does have a nice large bin to hold the food, so it should last several weeks at a time. It uses 3 ""D"" batteries as a backup and has a USB plug with an adapter that plugs into the wall. The batteries seem to only be as a backup in case the electricity goes out so the feedings will continue using the battery power. The timer setup was pretty easy and straight forward. It uses military time instead of 12-hour time, but that wasn\'t a problem. It automatically locks after you set it up so your animal can\'t press any of the buttons to feed themselves at off-times!When we first set it up and the first food came down the shoot and hit the bowl, our cat jumped and ran away! She was afraid of it! I brought her over to the feeder to show her what the noise had been and show her the food in the bowl and she ate it. The next time the food came down, she didn\'t jump but I had to show her that her food was there again. The third time the food came down and hit the bowl, our cat ran like lightening to the bowl to get her food! She knew exactly what the noise was. She can hear it from anywhere in our house and now when she hears it, she\'s off like a shot!Our cat is overweight so it is nice to be able to split up her feedings into smaller feedings so she doesn\'t eat so much or eat so fast. She only gets 7 tablespoons a day (a little less than half-cup), so I have her being fed 2 tablespoons at 6:00 a.m., 2 tablespoons at 10 a.m., 2 tablespoons at 4:00 p.m. and just one tablespoon at 9:00 p.m. We had to adjust the times to try to find the correct ones for her body. These are the times that seem to be working great for her. She doesn\'t beg us in between feedings because she\'s hungry anymore, which is great!If you think your animal needs an extra portion anytime, you can just unlock it and press on the up and down buttons at the same time to dispense one portion into the bowl. If you do that, it says that it doesn\'t affect the regular feeding schedule. You would just be giving your pet a little bit extra that day.I haven\'t tried to clean this machine yet, but it looks like it cannot be taken apart. It says to just wipe it out with a damp rag. Some of the other feeders I looked at after I ordered this one say that they come apart for easy cleaning. I think that would probably be a lot better than just wiping it out with a damp rag. I\'m sure our next feeder (if we ever need to buy one because this one wears out) will be one that we can take apart to clean.

So I\'ve been using a kitchen scale to measure his meals.Sadly, I will have to return the IMIPAW pet feeder. The company did a great job packing the product and the unboxing experience was terrific. The app was easy to figure out with just one small translation problem. The words ""feed number"" is their translation for the number of portions the device will deliver with that meal. In other words, its the number of times the rotating gear will turn to release another bunch of food. The rotating gear seems to be a flexible plastic or silicone.The reason I might have to return the product is inconsistent weights and occasional jams. I used my kitchen scale to measure how much food it was delivering with each portion. So basically I loaded the machine with food, and for about an hour I kept pressing the manual feed button and took the weights of the food, over and over. It varied between 4.21g and 9.32g per delivery.I like my guy to have 6g per meal consistently, so I\'m a little concerned with the overly large portions that come out sometimes. That\'s one and a half times what I\'m intending him to eat per meal.What scared me though is three times during my hour of testing, the machine completely jammed and no food was delivered, but the app sent the message that it was a successful delivery. The machine did not clear itself, so then the next meal also failed, and the one after that, and the one after that. Opening the top and manually stirring up the kibble successfully cleared the jam.Two other things to mention. My cat walked up to the feeder and immediately started eating from it, so there\'s no worries there. It\'s nice and quiet, too. Also my cat\'s dry food are Y-shaped kibbles. Maybe that is why the machine jammed or isn\'t delivering food evenly. If he had round kibbles, maybe the machine would be more successful. I have not seen any other reviewer mention jams or inconsistent weights, so I think maybe the problem is partly due to his brand of food, which I\'m not willing to change.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 14, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent item', 'author': 'Twincitiesopie', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Like the schedule and portions you can set up.

My goal was to have something that would not let my cats die while I am taking a short trip. I will start from cons. I have three cats, everyone who has three cats knows that they should get their food at the same time; otherwise, they'd all start eating from the same plate. My cats are also on a diet, they are fat and always hungry, so not only would they eat from the same plate, they would also fight. My idea was to set up the same time on all three feeders and then set the same schedule. Easy? Good luck with that. I thought setting up the time should not be an issue, you just unlock all three feeders, enter the time and then click a set button on all three simultaneously. Obviously, that's not how it works. You set up the time on the first one, then you try to set up the second one, and by the time you are ready, the first one locks itself and rolls back to the original settings. Also, you have to set the time and go through the entire scheduling exercise before it saves new settings. You do it on one, then you set the later time on the second one and wait for the first one to synch, then quickly go through the schedule and save your settings. Then you do the same thing on the third feeder. Needless to say, they do not dispose the food exactly at the same time, but after a bunch of attempts I was able to make them work within a few seconds. Don't ask me how frustrated I was at the end.Issue number two: they are small and not very stable. Three cats on a diet spend all their free time trying to figure out how to get the food out of the feeders. Here I have to compliment the manufacturer, my cats can't open the feeders or pull the food out through the opening. They can however, knock the feeders very easily. I wish there were suction cups on the bottom so I could stick the feeders to the tile or hardwood floor. I hope one day my cats will figure out that knocking the feeders does not help, but who knows, cats are weird and persistent in their weirdness.Now the pros: these are inexpensive and nice looking feeders that have a surprisingly good quality of the materials for this price. The dish is made from metal, and the first time the food fell out, it scared a hell out of my cats, but they quickly realized that this sound means their diet is over for a little while. The schedule works pretty well so far. I had an issue once when all of the sudden all three feeders stopped working for no reason. I went through the schedule without making any changes, and it fixed the problem. Hope it was a one time glitch maybe due to a power spike at night. I have to install the batteries, so it would not happen in the future. The portion control is also pretty good. I had to play with the size for a few days, but now when everything is set, I think my cats are getting a correct amount of food. Now I have to figure out how to handle one of the cats that inhales all the food like a vacuum cleaner and tries to steal from others, but I guess I can only do it with a fancy feeder that has a face control.Overall rating: three solid stars meaning it is satisfactory. Not very good, not excellent, but it does what it should do, and if I was not so mad setting them up, or at least if the instructions were more detailed and explained how to set up multiple feeders, I would have given four stars."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 16, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Utensilios electrónicos gatos', 'author': 'Maria', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Excelente', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 3, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Great but inaccurate', 'author': 'Patricia', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'We have 2 cats on 2 different foods.

I especially like the metal bowl since plastic bowls have been shown to cause skin issues in cats. That feature is important to me and why I passed up other feeders.The 6 available feeds is also something I was looking for. Our cats have 3 meals and 3 small snacks a day (don't judge, it works for us and they are both a healthy weight). Our new rescue is a little chonky so we are hopeful she will benefit from this schedule too.Setting up the programmable feeding schedule was tricky. By sheer trial and error I finally got to the 6 available feeds to set them to mirror our existing schedule. The written instructions are useless and do not match the instructions on the lid. One says long press the other says short press a button. Because I had programmed our other feeder, I finally figured it out.

You can set different time feedings and portion size for your pet. This feeder's 1 portion dispenses more food than the other feeder I have for my other cat so I had to adjust portion size rather than just copying what my other feeder is. The literal only thing I'm not crazy about is the sensor I believe is weird and I'm not sure how to fix it. I'll get about 10 notifications a day randomly through the day that it's low on food, even though it's completely full, so not sure if mine is kind of defective or if they're all like this. However it holds enough food for my cat for like easily 3-4 weeks so while that inaccurate notification is annoying, it's not a dealbreaker and I'm well aware if it's low on food or not. I ended up just turning off the notifications for the app. The app also has a Dispense History so you can ensure your pet hasn't missed a meal (if I'm out of town).

I like that the feeder has both an outlet power option and a battery backup for if the power goes out.You can set the feeder to dispense multiple times a day. One thing I was confused about - it wasn't in the instructions and the app is not clear at all - was what the 'feed number' meant in the app. Reading the product description, I *think* what this means is the number of 'servings' of food the feeder dispenses. I thought it was literally the 'number' of the feed (example, I had 1 Feed at 4:00 AM, 2 at 12:00, 3 at 4:00 PM) when actually what I was doing was dispensing more and more food as the day went on. Oops!I have been pretty pleased with it so far. The steel bowls have some marks on them - my cat is a messy eater and has dribbled water into the bowl, which left water stains. My cats also haven't figured out how to get into the feeder (whether through the lid or by putting their paw into the dispenser chute) which is a huge relief, since one of them is capable of opening the food storage bin."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 21, 2023', 'is_verified': False}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent cat feeder', 'author': 'K.

Make sure that your Bluetooth is working, and the initial setup would be establishing connecting from your phone to the feeder, as that’s how it’ll receive the WiFi configuration from your app connection.After setting up the app, you’ll have the full capability of the feeder including setting up scheduling to control portions.The feeder can be powered through the provided cable, or through 3x D batteries. The D batteries are very hefty, so even on battery power (which could serve as backup power) it should easily last half a year to a year. Note that this is my estimate for the battery power based on testing many feeders.The steel bowls are easily removable for washing, and I really like the fact that it’s stainless bowls.

You can modify the open/close speed to allow your pet time to get used to the movements of the lid and also can modify how long the lid stays open when they are no longer within the RFID range. Another small detail I enjoy is that you can record a mealtime message in the app, so whenever you have the auto-feeder setup you can have the device say ""dinner time"" or whatever you want in your own voice while it feeds your pet.There are two downsides for me though that really make this not a complete product:First, it would be really nice if they had a live camera/microhpone built in. This would help a lot during the training phase to see how your pet is reacting when going near it, it also would help when you are out of town and want to monitor/speak to your pet.Second, the RFID chip is massive! The picture in the product listingmade me believe that you could slide it on another collar and that\'s not the case. The only way to attach it to the non-original collar is to use a ring (which is included in the box). However, the chip swings around freely and is absolutely massive for a cat. I could see this being a negligible point for a medium-sized and above dog. However, we have a very skittish cat and the RFID chip is bothering her too much throughout the day to make it worthwhile. If they could either decrease the size of the chip, allow pet microchips to be synced or maybe even have some kind of fabric pocket that slides on the collar rather than dangling down, it would greatly improve this product and allow for use even with the most skittish of pets.Overall if those downsides aren\'t the end of the world for you or your pet, then this product is really great! It was packaged nicely, easy to put together, and made with high quality materials. It seems to be a reasonable price compared to like-products on the market and Petlibro has always had great products from the few I\'ve purchased (we also have several of their water fountains, which are amazing).Update: After about a week of use, this product is getting worse. It has issues dispensing food. If the bowl isn\'t virtually empty it will cause a backup and won\'t dispense more food. My cat for whatever reason prefers to eat from the front and sides of the bowl first. This leaves any remaining food at the rear of the bowl . This device registers this as the bowl being full and doesn\'t allow more to be dispensed.

My biggest concern was that my cats weren\'t going to figure out how to use it, but they did. Cool features in the app even allow you to schedule food to be dispensed periodically throughout the day, so we set up four small feedings (20 g, 10g, 10g and 20g) to be dispensed for breakfast, lunch, snack and supper. The feeders are kept in separate rooms.After I set up feeding schedules for both feeders in the app, each feeder has now randomly dispensed a full day\'s worth of food (all four feedings) between scheduled feedings. The first feeder did it the same day we set them up. We encouraged the cats to hang around so they could see the food being dispensed. Neither of them were near the dispenser at the time (several feet away). It only happened one time for that one feeder, so we chalked it up to a technology glitch (maybe I didn\'t set it up right, didn\'t save something, etc.) That was on Friday, (a day or two after we got it), and it worked as expected over the weekend, dispensing breakfast, lunch, snack and supper portions at the scheduled times.Yesterday (Tuesday), the same thing happened with the second feeder. Both cats were several rooms away from the feeder, asleep on our bed about an hour after the third feeding time (which they slept through) when a full day\'s worth of food was dispensed - in four consecutive portions, just like what happened with the first feeder a few days before. It still dispensed the last scheduled feeding at the right time afterward.I\'m at a loss. These were not inexpensive. My vet recommended getting something like it so our older cat could eat only her food (and not eat her sister\'s food) - she needs to lose the extra weight. I\'m lucky she doesn\'t ""wolf"" everything in her bowl (or at least she hasn\'t yet), but I should be able to rely on them only getting one day\'s food servings in 1 day.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 28, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '3.0 out of 5 stars RFID tag is bulky, feeder is too sensitive to chip proximity. Make this work with implanted chips!', 'author': 'Elisabeth B.', 'rating': 3, 'content': ""Update: Like another reviewer, the feeder is seemingly dropping food at random, not on the schedule set within the app (we have a non-RFID feeder from this company that doesn't have this problem). It seems to be dropping at 10 minutes after the hour at random. I sent an email to Petlibro's support team, so we'll see what they say - but I'm leaning towards this expensive feeder getting returned.First, if this feeder operated from my cat's implanted microchip, it would be amazing. The large, bulky tag that must be worn bothers my cat, and he's constantly trying to remove it from his neck, so I'm unsure if this feeder will work for us. If the tag were smaller, it could possibly work - but I'd really love to not have to have my cat wear a collar at all.The feeder is also much too 'sensitive' to the microchip tag - so if my cat is sitting near / next to his feeder, the door will stay open - allowing his brother to sneak in and eat as much as he wants, or grab a mouth full of food and run off with it. We have one overweight cat who eats all of his brother's food, so this sort of defeats the purpose of having a feeder like this. I'm unsure if this is something that could be fixed via a firmware update, but it definitely has an impact on the functionality.The positives? The hopper is airtight and holds a lot of food, the feeder is beautifully designed, and it was extremely easy to connect to the app (I already have another Petlibro feeder and water fountain). I also love being able to customize it with my pet's name or a message.I'm unsure if we will be able to keep the feeder - we'll likely give it a few days to see if my cat will keep the bulky tag on. The option to use an implanted microchip and having a slightly less sensitive sensor to said chip would easily make this a 5 out of 5, and I'd buy another one for my other cat.

One of my cats was diagnosed with IBD and has to eat prescription food. Now this guy is like a little vacuum if there is food he will find it and eat it. Both of my cats were used to food being out all the time. So my guy on the non prescription food was getting upset that his food couldn’t be out all the time. Meanwhile, the one on prescription food would play cat games and inevitably get to the non prescription food. Enter this feeder.The good:I love that it simply does its job. It only allows my nonprescription food boy to get his food anytime he wants it. I can set food times and the lid keeps his food fresh.The Meh:If your cat isn’t used to wearing a collar or tag I could see how they may have trouble with the tag. My guys have always worn collars since before I adopted them. The sensor tag for the feeder isn’t much bigger than a normal pet tag and is a little lighter. It is about the size of a quarter at the biggest point. My guy doesn’t have any issue but I could see how it could be one.My guy was very picky about standing on the sensor area. He wouldn’t stand on it until I put a dish drying mat over it.The ugly:My guy normally eats all the food from the front of the bowl so there are frequent blockages like twice a day.

I hope this review helps if you have cats like mine!For reference, I have one orange cat who is food obsessed (Gene). I have another tabby cat who is a grazer (Frank). At the moment I use the SureFeed microchip feeder but there are no doors and no automatic feeding option so I was really hoping the PetLibro one would fill that gap.What I Find Challenging:Bulky RFID Collar:The RFID collar provided is bulky and distracting, particularly for smaller cats. Comparatively, the SureFeed Microchip feeder's microchip reader seems more responsive and less obtrusive. A downsized RFID tag would be so much better here. My cat is so petite!Door Closing Speed:Despite confirming with Petlibro support that the feeder is functioning correctly, the door's closing speed on the fastest setting (1 second) is too slow. My food-motivated cat like Gene, can grab food before the door fully closes when my other cat walks away.Slow Food Dispensing:The slow dispensing of food - if I say my cat needs 2 portions it will spin out 2 portions pretty slowly. For a cat like Frank, who eats modestly throughout the day, the multiple drops required for one feeding can lead to waiting time ,which lets Gene anticipate and interfere with the process.Bowl Design Issues:The round-rectangle bowl shape is not great. Food gets stuck in the corners and it deff causes whisker fatigue. It needs to be raised or not so deep in the corners.What I Like:Auto-Feeder Concept:The automatic feeder with a door is a positive feature, particularly for households with less food-motivated cats on different diets.Monitoring Features:The ability to monitor the cat's eating habits on the app is really cool.Aesthetically Pleasing Design:The clean and sleek appearance of the Petlibro One RFID Feeder is commendable. Some even mistook it for a printer which I thought was funny but a call to its sleek look.Side Bumpers:The side bumpers are effective in keeping food thieves at bay while Frank was actively at the dish.Suggestions for Improvement:Microchip or RFID Tag Options:Offering a choice between microchip and RFID tags, with a downsized and more comfortable tag for cats with microchips, could address the issue of collar bulkiness.Faster Door Closing Mechanism:Enhancing the motor to close the door even faster could prevent food theft and improve the overall efficiency of the feeder.Revise Bowl Design:Rethinking the bowl design, perhaps elevating or changing its shape to prevent food accumulation in the corners, would be beneficial.If it was faster opening and closing as well as putting out food, had a better opening system (microchip or smaller RFID), and a better bowl would be perfect. It just didn't work in our household so instead I bought upgrades for my SureFeed Microchip feeder.Thanks!"", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 26, 2024', 'is_verified': True}]"

For some reason it didn't show up initially. There is no outside edge around the bowl. It is sloped downward to direct the food toward the center of the bowl, but my cat pushed the food up the slope & off of the side of the bowl. Big mess. I'm not sure why it didn't happen at first, but the problem didn't start until several weeks later.I really loved these bowls. They're cleverly made with protruding fishes that act to slow a cat's eating as they work to get the food from between them. This is one of the few bowls I saw formulated just for cats & there are many positives to the way it's made. The fish are a big deal at slowing the rate of eating. I also think that because the bowl is made of hard material, it was easier for my cat to eat, by using the hard surface of the fish to get a good grip on the piece of food she was trying to eat. She pushed the food up against the fish, where it was stopped by the hard surface, allowing her to then get it in her mouth.But that ended up being the reason for the problem too. She pushed the food around the bowl, and partially because the surface was hard & slippery, the food that didn't get wedged up against a fish, eventually got pushed right off of the bowl. I was sad when I had to pack up all of the bowls I'd bought & return them because I also thought they were pretty cute. But the long time went on, the worse the pushing of food from the bowl got to be, so they weren't helpful anymore. If the manufacturers would put a raised edge around the outside edge of the bowl, that would prevent food from getting pushed off of it. I liked these so much...until I didn't. In spite of my experience, I'd still recommend others give them a try. Your pet may not do what my cat did & they may be a perfect success story for you. To the manufacturers I'd recommend that you consider putting an edge around the bowl. Even if someone else's cat doesn't push the food off of the bowl, it would be a preventative measure so that it couldn't happen.

This product is definitely the first step to helping me out without having to get a cat sitter-- I didn\'t know there was automatic wet food feeders, and iPettie doesn\'t disappoint.The container itself works like a charm. When it transitions, it\'s nice and quiet--love it! And so far it\'s cat proof enough that my desperate kitty hasn\'t been able to tip it over, crack it open, or wiggle her paw into it, while it\'s really easy for me (as a human) to open it, add food, and clean it. The smooth circular shape is ingenious this way. It does take a a good chunk of floor space, in case that matters (I use a large cat kennel at lot to separate my cats, and it is a little cramped.)The holders are a good size. I can put in a 3oz can of food in there with no issue, it maybe maxes out around one 5.5 oz can before you\'re probably breaching too close to the outer cover that\'s covering it.The app is easy enough. it\'s called ""Smart Life"" (must be some generic smart device controller app developed in China) and they can even send firmware updates through it (which is pretty slick). When it connects to my feeder, it\'s pretty simple to add when I want the feeder to rotate (the hardest part was getting the name of the app from the youtube video tutorial, so you\'re welcome). I do wish there was an ""every day"" option, instead of scheduling it again and again each day, but minor stuff. Also minor, the log has the AM/PMs switched (so a planned 8 PM is showing as an 8 AM, and vice versa) but that\'s easy to ignore.The hardest part is the food storage logistics so really not like any problem with the product. The ice packs are great and keep the food cold, but realistically can only keep it cold for...12 hours at most. I refrigerate or freeze some food so it will stay cold longer, but I think it\'s really should be a max 48 hours thing. How it works for me (on a 2 a day feeding schedule):1) rotate out the ice packs (so one in the freezer, refreezing, while one is in the holder)2) only use 4 of the slots, with 3 slots of food on standby over 1 ice pack (the pack can be placed on the rear, it doesn\'t have to only be on the left or right side as pictured)3) for extra longevity, use frozen food that\'s on standby for >24 hrs (the 2 later slots).I think this is a fairly food safe method but we shall see...just thought I\'d put it out there since really that was the hardest part for me, trying to figure out what works for me and my cat. iPettie really made a great tool that makes it possible!', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 22, 2024', 'is_verified': False}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars I can sleep through the night', 'author': 'M.

The power switch is also located on the bottom of the feeder. There are 4 rubber foot pads on the bottom for better stability of the feeder on hard flooring and to keep it from sliding around.

It set up easily, and after a few seconds of inspection, my cat lapped from the water bowl. Though I just set it up, I see no reason why it won’t work fine, and will save me time in the morning when I usually top off my cat’s food. She does most of her eating overnight for whatever reason. I like it, and the design is pretty good, especially the fact that the water bowl’s rim is higher than the food bowl’s, making it a little less likely that kibble will wind up in the water, which was a common occurrence with my cat’s last bowl, which was one of those cheapo plastic side-by-side numbers. It is also cool that you can check food and water levels easily through the little windows.I am taking off a star due to the following:Firstly, there is no leaflet or manual explaining how the thing goes together or what the parts are. The box is just a brown blank one. I had to go back and peruse the rather lengthy Amazon copy for the item (which lacks clarity from a bit of a language gap) to learn that the blue thing in the water bowl is to keep the cat’s whiskers dry. I guess it minimizes splashing too. There was also a packet in the water bottle's nozzle assembly that I presume is some kind of charcoal filter. If so, it is very cheap, so much so that it's probably wholly ineffectual. On the off chance it’s some sort of silica thingy to keep things fresh for shipping, I tossed it. There is no explanation in the product’s write-up on Amazon that I saw, though I did not read every word. Anyway, the assembly is otherwise self-explanatory.Secondly, the seal of the top doesn’t seem very airtight, and the size of the food reservoir is pretty big. Air can of course get in from the bottom anyway, since simple gravity is how it operates. As a one cat owner, I think the kibble would get stale before it is all used up if I fill up the whole thing. I filled it only about halfway, so I guess that’ll work.Thirdly, as others have mentioned, I can tell it’ll be unwieldy to clean. You’d have to take out the water bottle, dump out the water, and empty out the food side prior to a thorough cleaning. It can see that process being a little annoying. No giant deal, but it is true. If the bowls had lift-out inserts, it might make it easier.Lastly, though the price is fair enough, as a very frugal shopper, I had to give a little “humph!” After I got it together. It is a very basic item, basically just some molded plastic and a bottle with a simple valve, and I’m inclined to see it as around $10 overpriced.

The one positive is that it does hold a lot of food and water, but that is about the ONLY positive.The thing I hate the most is that it is HORRIBLE when you are trying to clean it. If your cat is anything like mine, she accidentally spills food into the water side, and it ends up disintegrating and getting dirty pretty quickly. The little spacer/riser in the water area is a total waste and dirt collector as well. So anyways, when you get ready to clean the water side, you have to worry about all the food on the other side when you are trying to dump the water since this thing is NOT detachable. Pretty much the only way to clean this thing (mostly the water side) without spilling food EVERYWHERE, is if you emptied the entire thing. Even if you tried to empty it all to clean it, that is not the easiest task. The cylindrical piece that holds in the food and water does not clip in or snap in place and it moves VERY easily (AKA SPILL HAZARD). Therefore the only way to empty it to clean it is to wait for it to get empty... or hold the top & cylinder plastic thing VERY precisely as you CAREFULLY dump the food out of the bottom or top - pick your poison.The other annoying thing is that the opening where the food comes out is not very slanted, so you have to force the food out with your hands every couple days.Bottom line, this product was very poorly designed, and I do not recommend it unless it is last resort."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 5, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent!', 'author': 'Ashley “Rudy”', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Just as advertised', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 29, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars A Game-Changer for Pet Care', 'author': 'Gilbert', 'rating': 4, 'content': ""This product is a true game-changer for pet owners.

You can also install batteries for backup feeding in case you lose power, though I have not bothered with this as we have a whole house generator. The feeder comes with dual metal food bowls that sit in holders. I really like having two bowls, since every time it dispenses food, at least two cats come running from other parts of the house, and they don’t have to fight for space at the feeder. I also like the removable bowls which makes cleaning them really easy which I have to do frequently when my wife’s dog sneaks into the the room and wolfs all the cat food.

Basically, you can either manually feed anytime you want by pressing a button in the app, or you can set up one or more meal plans that each will put out a designated portion of food at a set time.Now, setting up the portions was a real headache. The way it works is you can set it to distribute (x) amount of ""feeds"" at a time, but to figure out how many ""feeds"" you need for each meal plan is just trial and error by manually seeing how much releases set with 1 feed, how much with 2, and so on. Personally, I use a 1/3 measuring cup to portion out my cat\'s food, so I had it release 1 feed, but that wasn\'t near enough. So let me try 4 feeds, well, that\'s too much, and so forth.Something else that is frustrating about this feeder is the way it pushes the food out or something, as it seems to cause a lot of crumbs, which makes for a much messier process than me just using the scoop ever did.

The lid of the hopper is pretty tough to remove, which is actually a good thing as my cats have been known to open letter containers without much trouble.I washed the parts and set it up. The little divider that goes between the food dishes felt backwards to me, but it seems to work, so whatever. After adding 4 AA batteries, the light came on and the unit was able to dispense food with a double-tap of the button. It seems to dispense about a tablespoon or so of our dry food (Meow Mix) per \'serving\' which is something I can work with.The app for the feeder, ""Smart Life"" appears to work with a large variety of other devices. In the app you can manually dispense food and set up as many as 10 scheduled meal times, each dispensing up to 36 servings - which I guess would probably fill both bowls. The app also keeps track of past feedings, but there is no way to tell for how long.The Smart Life app integrates with Google Home Assistant, but the feeder is apparently not a supported device, at least not for use with Google Home. I can\'t say something like ""Hey Google, feed the cat!"" This seems like a big missed opportunity on the manufacturer\'s part. I feel compelled to take a star from my review just because it\'s almost a bait and switch in that respect.I did a few manual feedings and at least a couple of my younger cats picked up on the noise of the food hitting the bowls and now come running when it spits out food.

Yours may have different opinions. While the bowls come with no assembly instructions, you really don't need them as there's only 2 pieces to attach and common sense will tell you how they attach. But for some inexplicable reason, they chose to use an allen wrench as opposed to a screwdriver. My only guess it that you'd need a really short handled screwdriver to attach the legs. It does include the obnoxious tool that is the allen wrench and in this case it's not as bad as most furniture that has allen screws. That said, it lost a star simply because of my cat's preferences.

The maximum portion is 12, so I recommend estimating a normal feed is at the bare minimum a 4 or 5.2) The chute where the food is dispensed is wide open, and my little demon has figured out she can fit her paw up there to fish out more food. I'm concerned she's gonna end up breaking the mechanism, so I taped a piece of cardboard over it. It's secured at the top, so when the food dispenses it acts a like a hinge. So far so good, but we'll see how long that lasts. I also recommend using the lock setting if your cat is smart. Otherwise it WILL learn how to press the feed button on the front.3) Getting it connected to the wifi was a bit of a frustrating experience. I recommend having it almost on top of your router when you first try to connect it. But once I got it to connect, no issues.Overall, this is a fairly convenient auto feeder.

I'm Shocked How Good It Is!"", 'author': 'Ryan A. Leemhuis', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'A little background first. We had previously used the Crown Majestic feeder for our cat. It worked fairly well although it was a bit ugly, would occasionally jam and the portion sizes were very hit and miss. We used it until its power connection internally broke and it would only run off batteries which was difficult to keep up with.So that led me on my search for a replacement. There are a lot more options now than there used to be. My main features I was looking for were wifi control and reliability.I found it difficult to narrow down my choice as I found varying reviews and some claimed that a model was terrible and some said it was amazing. I eventually settled on the Petkit mini feeder from a cost and design perspective. First of all, it looks great. I love the thought that went into the design from the magnetically attached bowl to the jumper that allows the DC adapter to easily disconnect from the wall should you need. I was a little nervous about how much food could be stored but upon seeing the compartment this is a good amount for a cat. I find we need to fill it once every 2 weeks or so.That brings us to the worst part of the product. Lets just be clear here...the app is decent...but there are some language oddities and the setup did not go according to design. I am a techy and I initially tried pairing the feeder with my phone. It got fairly far into the setup but kept failing out during the wifi pairing process. I then tried my wife\'s phone and it did the same. I then happened to notice that the feeder was already showing on the app\'s dashboard and sure enough it had been paired even though the app claimed it had failed. I don\'t know why this occurred but be prepared for some setup issues.Once setup, however, the app is great. The food portion sizes are accurate and on demand feeds occur nearly immediately. The schedule is easy to setup and food is distributed on time. We use prescription ""disc-shaped"" food and other feeders claimed they weren\'t compatible. We have had ZERO issues with this machine getting jammed or having any issue with our food. It is actually very fun to watch the little door open on the machine and then the food dump out.For the cost, this feeder is a steal. It is so much better than our previous feeder it makes me wonder why I didn\'t upgrade earlier. My only suggestions for improvement would be to further improve the app and instructions translations. There are some real English oddities (which you can see in the product\'s amazon page as well. In addition, the setup process obviously needs some improvement too as it failed twice for me and some how magically appeared on my apps dashboard after this fail. Other than that, the feeder is perfect. It feels very high quality and the mechanics seem sound. HIGHLY recommended.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 29, 2019', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars PetKit Mini - Small Pet Feeder - Review', 'author': 'AirplaneCatBlue', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""The PetKit Mini feeder is attractively and elegantly designed. It looks like it belongs in an art museum.The PetKit Mini feeder is the ideal automatic feeder for my needs. What I like best is that it precisely delivers very small meals (as little as 1/20 of a cup or 5 grams) to my overweight cat up to 10 times per day. In my case I had been feeding my cat 20 grams of cat kibbles twice per day... or 40 grams. My cat was waking me up at 4 AM begging for more food. The PetKit Mini stopped the begging behavior! With the PetKit Mini I was able to schedule 8 feedings of 5 grams each... for a total of 40 grams per day... but spread out over the course of the day and night. This way my cat gets precisely fed her reduced ration and eliminates my tendency to give her a little extra when she begs.The PetKit Mini has improved my cat's relationship with me. She no longer relies on me for food. With the PetKit Mini she visits me often and regularly because she wants my company... not because she wants food. And it has improved my relationship with my cat since I am no longer irritated by her pestering behaviors at 4 AM when she gets hungry.The engineers who designed the PetKit Mini payed very close attention to critical details that separate this feeder from the pack. I studied them all before I made my purchase decision. The silicone rubber paddles that meter the kibbles into the rotary dosing cups are designed to flex so the kibbles don’t jam in the mechanism.The engineers used silicone rubber gaskets to seal out moisture at the feeding door and food reservoir lid. Then they provide a replaceable desiccant pack (those little packs that you often find in a box of new shoes) that absorb any moisture that might otherwise accumulate in your dried food. You can imagine that if your kibbles absorbed moisture from the air and swelled up like a sponge that they wouldn’t feed well in the mechanism. It also keeps the food fresher and prevents mold growth I would think.I found the PetKit Mini was easy to set up. It did help that I had an $8 electronic scale so I could better measure in grams how much I had been feeding my cat. I had been using a very small measuring cup. It was a lot easier to weigh the kibbles than to try to measure the volume of food.I measured the amount of food the PetKit Mini delivered with each feeding. I did this 8 times just to see how repeatable the feedings were. With my dry kibbles the average amount of each feeding was 4.97 grams. Pretty good if you were targeting 5 grams! (The standard deviation was 0.31 grams… who remembers what a standard deviation is???)Since I am only feeding my cat 40 grams per day the food reservoir is large enough for storing a 37 day supply. I can just check the food level once per month to be safe… but the PetKit Mini is designed with a monitor that will alert me when the food is low. What a great feature! It will also remind me every 30 days to replace the desiccant pack. I found some after-market desiccant packs on EBay that will fit the PetKit Mini because I couldn’t find any OEM packs online.This is a great automatic WiFI cat feeder! I liked it so much I bought a second PetKit Mini for my daughter for Christmas. She too has an overweight cat (though not for long).

Unboxing and putting everything together is easy, and so far the feeder has been reliable. That said, I think the app is a lot more complex than it needs to be, and while that can be updated and changed over time, it's important to know what you're getting into.When you go through setup of the feeder and app for the first time, I think the experience is a bit all over the place. There are instruction stickers on the feeder itself, there is a booklet of instructions, there are QR codes and links within the booklet to scan to get to videos that you have to watch for further steps, and then there's setup within the app itself... etc. I think it's just a few too many layers of info and could be pared down significantly. Once everything is setup and you're trying to actually use the app, those same issues of unnecessary layers/ complications continue. The app tries to get you to schedule meals based on feeding recommendations for your pet, so you have to setup a profile for each of your pets first. This sounds minor, but it's quite detailed, and includes a whole lot of information that isn't truly necessary just to make a recommendation for feeding quantity. In the end, a truly informed recommendation would really require nutrition information about your pet food itself, so the whole exercise is a bit silly. I was left feeling a bit unsure of how much of this information I *really* needed or wanted to complete. Once you have been asked about various details for your pet, then you need to schedule fixed meals for each, and again I do appreciate that they tried to include a lot of options for customization, but it's just too much. For one, how do they propose that you make sure the right pet eats the right meal, etc? I think it would be much easier to remove those options, or hide them behind an advanced mode, and just let you set a very simple schedule with set times and quantities. K.I.S.S. you know? Given that the app doesn't interface with bluetooth trackers or smart catboxes or anything like that, I'm not sure I see any need for the pet profiles at all! It just adds complexity for no discernible reason.Beyond the actual cumbersome data entry requirements, I found the interface to be not very intuitive. I had difficulty finding the settings that I actually wanted to look for and find out more about, such as the Alexa integration, and kept getting lost in layers of social media integrations and gamification... which, why? I was looking into trying out the Smart Home integration options, but do I need a community and messaging platform for my smart feeder? Maybe this is more of a cultural thing, I believe the company is based in China, but I just don't need this kind of fluff cluttering up the basic functions of the app. I'd really enjoy it more if they could pull back on these added features, or again, maybe just hide them all in one area of the app called 'Social' or similar, but they seemed to be behind every corner. For me, again it just took away from the experience of feeling like I could find the basic information and functions quickly and easily. Thankfully, apps can be can be improved and refined over time, so I feel that most of those concerns are somewhat secondary. If you plan to use it in a way where you can sit down and get through it, then basically 'set it and forget it', I think it will work well for you. But if you would plan to regularly make any tweaks to your meal plans, I think it would be a not-minor annoyance. I'll also mention that this is something my partner and I considered setting up for aging parents, just as a little convenience item to make their lives easier. After working with it, I don't know if I can comfortably go that direction. I definitely don't feel confident that they would have gotten through any of the initial setup themselves, but I also don't think they could make any on-the-fly changes to the configuration even if the initial steps were done for them. My advice to the developers would be: pare down to the basics and make sure they are quick and intuitive. THEN add extras, but remember they are extras and not your primary functions.Ok, so it seems like I'm coming down kind of harsh. All that said, I do think this product will work just fine for use in my own home. The feeder itself is sturdy and has so far been reliable. While I don't have direct experience with a lot of competing products, I had been taking note of some other design issues I'd noted in some of those competitors and waited to try something that seemed to address them. For one, I don't just appreciate the option for plug-in power and battery backup, for me that's an absolute requirement on something like this. The food storage compartment also seems secure, which was a concern I had because I have one cat that will get into ANYTHING edible that is left out. I'm impressed because he hasn't even tried with this, which also tells me the seals are probably decent and he's not being tempted by the smell of kibble. That also leads me to believe that bugs shouldn't be an issue, though time will tell. I also appreciate that the actual food bowl portion is easily removable, as it just snaps into place with a magnet. Being plastic based, it's important to clean something like that regularly and you and I both know that won't happen if it's a pain point. Ideally, I would really like to see this component and the food storage bin being made out of stainless steel, but maybe that's something that could be incorporated in a future revision as well.Let's wrap this up...On the whole, if you are patient and technologically competent enough to get through the configuration of the app itself, it's a good product that I think you'll be happy with."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 12, 2020', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '1.0 out of 5 stars The PetKit app is nearly useless for this feeder!

I'm Shocked How Good It Is!"", 'author': 'Ryan A. Leemhuis', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'A little background first. We had previously used the Crown Majestic feeder for our cat. It worked fairly well although it was a bit ugly, would occasionally jam and the portion sizes were very hit and miss. We used it until its power connection internally broke and it would only run off batteries which was difficult to keep up with.So that led me on my search for a replacement. There are a lot more options now than there used to be. My main features I was looking for were wifi control and reliability.I found it difficult to narrow down my choice as I found varying reviews and some claimed that a model was terrible and some said it was amazing. I eventually settled on the Petkit mini feeder from a cost and design perspective. First of all, it looks great. I love the thought that went into the design from the magnetically attached bowl to the jumper that allows the DC adapter to easily disconnect from the wall should you need. I was a little nervous about how much food could be stored but upon seeing the compartment this is a good amount for a cat. I find we need to fill it once every 2 weeks or so.That brings us to the worst part of the product. Lets just be clear here...the app is decent...but there are some language oddities and the setup did not go according to design. I am a techy and I initially tried pairing the feeder with my phone. It got fairly far into the setup but kept failing out during the wifi pairing process. I then tried my wife\'s phone and it did the same. I then happened to notice that the feeder was already showing on the app\'s dashboard and sure enough it had been paired even though the app claimed it had failed. I don\'t know why this occurred but be prepared for some setup issues.Once setup, however, the app is great. The food portion sizes are accurate and on demand feeds occur nearly immediately. The schedule is easy to setup and food is distributed on time. We use prescription ""disc-shaped"" food and other feeders claimed they weren\'t compatible. We have had ZERO issues with this machine getting jammed or having any issue with our food. It is actually very fun to watch the little door open on the machine and then the food dump out.For the cost, this feeder is a steal. It is so much better than our previous feeder it makes me wonder why I didn\'t upgrade earlier. My only suggestions for improvement would be to further improve the app and instructions translations. There are some real English oddities (which you can see in the product\'s amazon page as well. In addition, the setup process obviously needs some improvement too as it failed twice for me and some how magically appeared on my apps dashboard after this fail. Other than that, the feeder is perfect. It feels very high quality and the mechanics seem sound. HIGHLY recommended.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 29, 2019', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars PetKit Mini - Small Pet Feeder - Review', 'author': 'AirplaneCatBlue', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""The PetKit Mini feeder is attractively and elegantly designed. It looks like it belongs in an art museum.The PetKit Mini feeder is the ideal automatic feeder for my needs. What I like best is that it precisely delivers very small meals (as little as 1/20 of a cup or 5 grams) to my overweight cat up to 10 times per day. In my case I had been feeding my cat 20 grams of cat kibbles twice per day... or 40 grams. My cat was waking me up at 4 AM begging for more food. The PetKit Mini stopped the begging behavior! With the PetKit Mini I was able to schedule 8 feedings of 5 grams each... for a total of 40 grams per day... but spread out over the course of the day and night. This way my cat gets precisely fed her reduced ration and eliminates my tendency to give her a little extra when she begs.The PetKit Mini has improved my cat's relationship with me. She no longer relies on me for food. With the PetKit Mini she visits me often and regularly because she wants my company... not because she wants food. And it has improved my relationship with my cat since I am no longer irritated by her pestering behaviors at 4 AM when she gets hungry.The engineers who designed the PetKit Mini payed very close attention to critical details that separate this feeder from the pack. I studied them all before I made my purchase decision. The silicone rubber paddles that meter the kibbles into the rotary dosing cups are designed to flex so the kibbles don’t jam in the mechanism.The engineers used silicone rubber gaskets to seal out moisture at the feeding door and food reservoir lid. Then they provide a replaceable desiccant pack (those little packs that you often find in a box of new shoes) that absorb any moisture that might otherwise accumulate in your dried food. You can imagine that if your kibbles absorbed moisture from the air and swelled up like a sponge that they wouldn’t feed well in the mechanism. It also keeps the food fresher and prevents mold growth I would think.I found the PetKit Mini was easy to set up. It did help that I had an $8 electronic scale so I could better measure in grams how much I had been feeding my cat. I had been using a very small measuring cup. It was a lot easier to weigh the kibbles than to try to measure the volume of food.I measured the amount of food the PetKit Mini delivered with each feeding. I did this 8 times just to see how repeatable the feedings were. With my dry kibbles the average amount of each feeding was 4.97 grams. Pretty good if you were targeting 5 grams! (The standard deviation was 0.31 grams… who remembers what a standard deviation is???)Since I am only feeding my cat 40 grams per day the food reservoir is large enough for storing a 37 day supply. I can just check the food level once per month to be safe… but the PetKit Mini is designed with a monitor that will alert me when the food is low. What a great feature! It will also remind me every 30 days to replace the desiccant pack. I found some after-market desiccant packs on EBay that will fit the PetKit Mini because I couldn’t find any OEM packs online.This is a great automatic WiFI cat feeder! I liked it so much I bought a second PetKit Mini for my daughter for Christmas. She too has an overweight cat (though not for long).

Unboxing and putting everything together is easy, and so far the feeder has been reliable. That said, I think the app is a lot more complex than it needs to be, and while that can be updated and changed over time, it's important to know what you're getting into.When you go through setup of the feeder and app for the first time, I think the experience is a bit all over the place. There are instruction stickers on the feeder itself, there is a booklet of instructions, there are QR codes and links within the booklet to scan to get to videos that you have to watch for further steps, and then there's setup within the app itself... etc. I think it's just a few too many layers of info and could be pared down significantly. Once everything is setup and you're trying to actually use the app, those same issues of unnecessary layers/ complications continue. The app tries to get you to schedule meals based on feeding recommendations for your pet, so you have to setup a profile for each of your pets first. This sounds minor, but it's quite detailed, and includes a whole lot of information that isn't truly necessary just to make a recommendation for feeding quantity. In the end, a truly informed recommendation would really require nutrition information about your pet food itself, so the whole exercise is a bit silly. I was left feeling a bit unsure of how much of this information I *really* needed or wanted to complete. Once you have been asked about various details for your pet, then you need to schedule fixed meals for each, and again I do appreciate that they tried to include a lot of options for customization, but it's just too much. For one, how do they propose that you make sure the right pet eats the right meal, etc? I think it would be much easier to remove those options, or hide them behind an advanced mode, and just let you set a very simple schedule with set times and quantities. K.I.S.S. you know? Given that the app doesn't interface with bluetooth trackers or smart catboxes or anything like that, I'm not sure I see any need for the pet profiles at all! It just adds complexity for no discernible reason.Beyond the actual cumbersome data entry requirements, I found the interface to be not very intuitive. I had difficulty finding the settings that I actually wanted to look for and find out more about, such as the Alexa integration, and kept getting lost in layers of social media integrations and gamification... which, why? I was looking into trying out the Smart Home integration options, but do I need a community and messaging platform for my smart feeder? Maybe this is more of a cultural thing, I believe the company is based in China, but I just don't need this kind of fluff cluttering up the basic functions of the app. I'd really enjoy it more if they could pull back on these added features, or again, maybe just hide them all in one area of the app called 'Social' or similar, but they seemed to be behind every corner. For me, again it just took away from the experience of feeling like I could find the basic information and functions quickly and easily. Thankfully, apps can be can be improved and refined over time, so I feel that most of those concerns are somewhat secondary. If you plan to use it in a way where you can sit down and get through it, then basically 'set it and forget it', I think it will work well for you. But if you would plan to regularly make any tweaks to your meal plans, I think it would be a not-minor annoyance. I'll also mention that this is something my partner and I considered setting up for aging parents, just as a little convenience item to make their lives easier. After working with it, I don't know if I can comfortably go that direction. I definitely don't feel confident that they would have gotten through any of the initial setup themselves, but I also don't think they could make any on-the-fly changes to the configuration even if the initial steps were done for them. My advice to the developers would be: pare down to the basics and make sure they are quick and intuitive. THEN add extras, but remember they are extras and not your primary functions.Ok, so it seems like I'm coming down kind of harsh. All that said, I do think this product will work just fine for use in my own home. The feeder itself is sturdy and has so far been reliable. While I don't have direct experience with a lot of competing products, I had been taking note of some other design issues I'd noted in some of those competitors and waited to try something that seemed to address them. For one, I don't just appreciate the option for plug-in power and battery backup, for me that's an absolute requirement on something like this. The food storage compartment also seems secure, which was a concern I had because I have one cat that will get into ANYTHING edible that is left out. I'm impressed because he hasn't even tried with this, which also tells me the seals are probably decent and he's not being tempted by the smell of kibble. That also leads me to believe that bugs shouldn't be an issue, though time will tell. I also appreciate that the actual food bowl portion is easily removable, as it just snaps into place with a magnet. Being plastic based, it's important to clean something like that regularly and you and I both know that won't happen if it's a pain point. Ideally, I would really like to see this component and the food storage bin being made out of stainless steel, but maybe that's something that could be incorporated in a future revision as well.Let's wrap this up...On the whole, if you are patient and technologically competent enough to get through the configuration of the app itself, it's a good product that I think you'll be happy with."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 12, 2020', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '1.0 out of 5 stars The PetKit app is nearly useless for this feeder!

No. But I’ve been using it for several weeks, occasionally measuring the output, and it feel it is close enough. I also like the built-in camera so I can see the food going into the bowl.

The big issue was that the two units, even though they were the same exact model, kept time differently. One was fast, the other was slow, so over the course of a week, we would have a gulf of about 2 1/2 minutes which resulted in hurt feelings and competition. Cue the third cat and we tried a different brand. That one kept time a little better, but we were still struggling with clocks that would never be synchronized and it was a chore to always update 3 feeders every few days just to ensure the cats were fed at their respective stations at the same time and no one had an opportunity to eat theirs and steal another's in the time it took for food to be dispensed.I had my eye on this, as it's WiFi enabled, and we already have the automatic litter box, so we were familiar with the brand. I bought a couple to trial and they have worked wonders so far, the internet connectivity ensures they are dispensing at almost identical times, rather than relying on an onboard clock. So, we purchased a third, and will purchase a fourth and fifth once the kittens are a bit bigger.Setting up the feeding plan is a breeze and refilling couldn't be easier. I also like the shallow bowl because it does keep whisker fatigue to a minimum as they don't have to bury their heads too deep to reach their food.Set up was a breeze as well. It was very easy to connect as the device was easily recognized and firmware updates took moments without any failures. The app works great with virtually no delays in input - want to give them a little snack? Tap the snack button, select your serving size and it dispenses as soon as you make your choice.For the price and the features, it's a no brainer. There's simply no reason reason to pay more for less with competitors, at least those who are respectable names in this market, and not just a random brand that has popped up trying to offer a cheap alternative with a janky app.5/5 stars."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 28, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Super happy I risked this feeder!!', 'author': 'Amazon Customer', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'UPDATE**: still 5stars. Update is bc people are saying this has a bad wifi system. I set up a separate 2.4G network off my main 5G network, and it works perfectly fine. I get 2-3 wifi Bars on my phone from where the feeder is so I do have a good network connection. Only have about avg 700-800mbps wifi and a ton of other items in the home like security cameras and smart plugs with multiple roommates also tech heavy, so the issue is definitely not with the feeder (unless they got a defective one idk). I did have my power go out once but due to the battery backup the feeder still dispensed food on time and reconnected to the wifi when the power came back on without me having to do anything. Also read someone said the app didn’t work with an iPhone. I have a newer iPhone and the app was super easy, as if I was downloading any other app (Instagram, etc.). Updating bc I don’t want people to overlook this feeder bc of a few reviews that don’t always apply.So this feeder only had 8 reviews when I ordered it which is way low for my usual trust with a new brand. however, MY CATS LOVE THIS FEEDER. They weren’t intimidated by the size or layout. Very intuitive for my cats to use. Love that it’s also a plain clean look with the app (so far so good) and doesn’t have those tacky looking buttons on most automatic feeders. Extremely clean design which was a big factor in buying. The lid That seals is also nice. I picked up the feeder and turned it sideways just to see if it would spill, and it stayed secure with the latch they used.The installation was incredibly easy and straight forward. I expected it to be more intense. My cats use purina one kitten food mixed with purina one probiotic health adult food, and the dispenser has done very well with portion size mixed. Will update this if anything changes.The App really impressed me with how it logged my cats’ weights and age etc to help with portion control. I needed this bc I wasn’t sure how much to give my kitties after them being on an open bowl meal (but got too chunky hence the feeder & I am a student and not always home etc).Only Pros at this Point. I got the stainless steel option and highly recommend that bowl as opposed to the plastic. Your cat will appreciate it and it’s a lot easier to clean.The Green Color is exactly how the picture looks.

I\'ll update if it stops working or something. The app isn\'t super sleek and displays my feeding history partially in Chinese, but it\'s not too confusing either, and the feeder quickly connected to my iPhone on a 2.4G network. Set up was really easy, 2-3 minutes, and mostly I just use the ""extra feeding"" button, although the recommended meal plan seemed appropriate if all my cat ate was dry food, and was easy to edit. I like the green color and the stainless steel bowl.I\'ve only had it for a few weeks, with no problems. My cat is underweight, not food-motivated, usually eats raw or wet food, and was recently diagnosed with kidney issues and maybe isn\'t really supposed to be eating dry food anyway. However, he often refuses to eat his wet food, especially prescription food, before I leave for work. It\'s better for him to eat dry food than not eat at all, so I use this to send him small amounts food throughout the day and give me some peace of mind that if he wants to eat, he can (and that the food isn\'t super stale). I do wish the feeder could tell me if the cat has eaten any of the food in the bowl, and how much, instead of just logging how much has been dispensed. This way I could track his eating and avoid adding more food when he hasn\'t eaten... but maybe that\'s a lot to ask from a feeder? Anyway, having a remotely controlled feeder also means that if I find I\'m not going to be home for scheduled feeding times, it\'s not such a big deal, which is good because I live in a city with unpredictable traffic. I\'m pretty satisfied.Edit: I\'ve had the feeder for a while now to feed two cats on a schedule. It does have some bugs. The main issue is that it will double-dispense food randomly, some 10-20% of the time. I always receive a notification that it\'s working normally and has released the scheduled amount of food, but if I am home, I can see/hear that it dispenses, and then after about 30 seconds dispenses the same amount again, this time without sending any notification. This isn\'t as bad as if it were not dispensing any food at all, but it\'s a pain because one of my cats will happily overeat and get sick if I\'m not home to intervene. The only solution seems to be making meals even smaller so that when it double dispenses, it\'s not so much extra. I also somewhat frequently receive notifications that the feeder is jammed or low on food when it is not (maybe twice a month). The feeder has only actually jammed once.

As a busy pet owner, I'm always looking for ways to ensure my cat is fed on time, even when I'm away from home. This feeder has exceeded my expectations in every way.First and foremost, the ability to control the feeder remotely via the PETKIT app is a game-changer. Whether I'm at work, running errands, or traveling, I can easily monitor my cat's feeding schedule and adjust it as needed with just a few taps on my smartphone. The convenience and peace of mind this provides are priceless.I love that I can schedule up to 10 meals per day, allowing me to customize my cat's feeding routine to fit his needs perfectly. Plus, the feeder's portion control feature ensures that he receives the right amount of food at each meal, helping to maintain his health and weight.The build quality of the PETKIT feeder is also impressive. It's sturdy and reliable, with a sleek and modern design that looks great in any home. The food storage compartment is spacious enough to hold a generous amount of kibble, reducing the need for frequent refills.Overall, I couldn't be happier with the PETKIT Automatic WiFi Cat Feeder.

I don\'t know why companies don\'t sit regular people down with their product and say ""set this up"" it might help. After getting connected, started a meal plan. I did not have to do a pet profile as some others reported. If I did, I would have stopped.Smallest portion is 1/10 cup. I usually feed her less as she gobbles and then throws it up, but I tried it.So I set up 4 feeds a day. This is tedious with scrolling wheels for times for each feeding. After that you are to hit ""start plan"". I get message ""request incorrect"". what\'s that mean? If you go back a page it erases your plan and you have to start over.Start over. Same thing. 4 times 16 entries. I guess I wasn\'t smart enough to just try one time! Finally I figured out it had lost internet connection. App will show ""Petkit is running"" which means you are connected to the machine but not the internet? Reconnected, and it save the next plan I put in. On the settings page it will show ""online"", why not have it on the home page??? Why not notify you lost connection??. The hopper was half full, but kept getting empty message till I turned that off.So now waiting for morning to check feeding. First time is 6:15. Times are military, so I know I\'m doing ""am"" morning. Get up at 5:30 and there is food in the bowl. Go to app and it dispensed 2 feedings already. 7 hours ahead of scedule which means it\'s on GMT. There is nowhere to set local time that I can find. Now waiting for the next feeding to see. 9am should be my 4pm feeding. Easy UPDATE: My 4pm feeding happened at 9am 7 hours ahead.

Town', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I bought this for a colony of about a dozen feral cats (all but a couple TNR\'d) that live in the woods near my house. I set them up some beds and a big food bowl in a shed but raccoons and possums were stealing the food. (And I was tired if going out in the rain to fill the bowl.) So I got this feeder and set it up in the shed. So far, this has held up well. The raccoons and possums can only steal 1/2 cup at a time. The raccoons get pretty aggressive when the bowl is empty but they haven\'t managed to get the lid off the new feeder. I\'ve seen them tossing it around on the security camera but the feeder\'s held up fine. I eventually attached it to the floor of the shed.I haven\'t set up a schedule because feral cats are terrible at telling time. If it\'s empty when I check the security camera, I hit ""Extra feeding"" on my phone and dump 1/2 cup in the bowl. It took the cats about 2 days to figure out that the noise means food. Sometimes I\'ll see 3 or 4 of them sitting in a semi-circle around the bowl waiting for me to hit the button.I\'ve run several brands of cat food thru it (whatever\'s on sale in bulk) and it\'s pretty consistent with the portion despite the different sizes and shapes of the kibble. I\'ve never had it get stuck with food left in the hopper. It gets down to the last few pieces every time.It would be nice if it was easier to clean. You have to take out 4 screws to take the dispenser chamber off and really get in there with a brush to get the rotating part clean.

I’ve spent an incredible amount of time researching Cat Feeders ever since 2020 when PetNet (feeders) went out of business. They were the best in the industry, hands-down! and now I’m stuck with TWO of their $150 paper weights, essentially. I’ve searched far and wide for replacements. So on Amazon Prime Day, July 12, I pulled the trigger on a deal for this ELEMENT SOLO feeder. I’ll be returning it promptly before my 30 day money-back guarantee runs out.1st - the amount of information that you MUST input just to set up a feeding schedule is by far very un necessary. You have to create a profile for your animal, you have to enter their height, their weight, their age their type, then you need to input their food brand, THEN verify if it fits in the feeder, and THEN enter the ingredients and what %percentage of moisture and ash etc. etc. None of that is necessary when you’re using a measurement you already know and what type or amount of food you’re going to dispense. You just want to set up a schedule to have it done. BTW the plug is quite large, so I you’ll waste the space beside it, and above it, which is very unfortunate.2nd -my cat is on a strict food diet. His dry food portion of his diet he receives 1/4 (ONE QUARTER) cup of dry kibble (IAMS) TWICE a day to totaling 1/2 (ONE HALF) cup of food per day.By the third day, this feeder gave me issues, dispensing the incorrect amount of food. Sometimes it dispensed 16 kibbles. Sometimes it gave 48 kibbles. Sometimes it gave 62 kibbles. None of those equaled 1/4 cup as I tested it out for EACH of their dispensing measurements PRIOR to using it. The closest I could get to 1/4 cup of their measurements was 3/10 so I used that and set up a feeding plan per their requirements to automatically feed two times a day every 12 hours using the 3/10 dispensed amount. They use FIFTHS (1/5) measurements so it’s a little confusing trying to find what worked for 1/4 cup dispensing amounts. Then within that problem lies another one that’s even bigger. After posting a question about an accurate amounts, dispensed, and then reaching out to their support team, I found an answer. This feeder will only feed an APPROXIMATE amount of their dispensed portion (of 3/10 cup). Let that soak in for a minute. Give it a second. Really let it soak in.Now, let me give you a scenario. … Dr tells you, based on your weight, height and the food intake you can eat (lets use RICE) 1 cup of Rice per meal for a total of 3 cups rice per day. Ok Doc, great. I can do that.So, on your first meal, I hand you … oh, let’s say maybe 2/3 cup, and on your second meal, I hand you let’s say maybe 3/4, on your third meal, I hand you oh maybe 7/8th. You’re an adult, a senior even, so you “understand” what you’re allowed to have per meal and your rice is right there, in that square thing that makes a noise and gives you your rice but it’s not giving you what you’re allowed to have each meal. Would you be happy? Or full? or satisfied? Or always thinking about food and how to get it out of that thing. Because if it’s edible (& sometimes even if it’s not edible) you’ll attempt to get it and eat it. Because all you do is EAT, SLEEP, POOP/PEE, PLAY & PURRTo finish, I would like to quote the review of another Amazon verified purchase user, Jessica (3 years ago! man I SHOULD’VE dug deeper)“ Jessica4.0 out of 5 starsVerified PurchaseBasic features work well, unnecessarily complex app makes setup a painReviewed in the United States on May 12, 2020I think my title basically says it all, but I'm not really a brief person so here goes...On the whole, I'm very pleased with the quality of the build of this product, and the ease of filling and cleaning, which are really paramount concerns for something like this. Unboxing and putting everything together is easy, and so far the feeder has been reliable.That said, I think the app is a lot more complex than it needs to be, and while that can be updated and changed over time, it's important to know what you're getting into.When you go through setup of the feeder and app for the first time, I think the experience is a bit all over the place. There are instruction stickers on the feeder itself, there is a booklet of instructions, there are QR codes and links within the booklet to scan to get to videos that you have to watch for further steps, and then there's setup within the app itself... etc. I think it's just a few too many layers of info and could be pared down significantly. Once everything is setup and you're trying to actually use the app, those same issues of unnecessary layers/ complications continue. The app tries to get you to schedule meals based on feeding recommendations for your pet, so you have to setup a profile for each of your pets first. This sounds minor, but it's quite detailed, and includes a whole lot of information that isn't truly necessary just to make a recommendation for feeding quantity. In the end, a truly informed recommendation would really require nutrition information about your pet food itself, so the whole exercise is a bit silly. I was left feeling a bit unsure of how much of this information I *really* needed or wanted to complete. Once you have been asked about various details for your pet, then you need to schedule fixed meals for each, and again I do appreciate that they tried to include a lot of options for customization, but it's just too much. For one, how do they propose that you make sure the right pet eats the right meal, etc? I think it would be much easier to remove those options, or hide them behind an advanced mode, and just let you set a very simple schedule with set times and quantities. K.I.S.S. you know? Given that the app doesn't interface with bluetooth trackers or smart catboxes or anything like that, I'm not sure I see any need for the pet profiles at all! It just adds complexity for no discernible reason.Beyond the actual cumbersome data entry requirements, I found the interface to be not very intuitive. I had difficulty finding the settings that I actually wanted to look for and find out more about, such as the Alexa integration, and kept getting lost in layers of social media integrations and gamification... which, why? I was looking into trying out the Smart Home integration options, but do I need a community and messaging platform for my smart feeder? Maybe this is more of a cultural thing, I believe the company is based in China, but I just don't need this kind of fluff cluttering up the basic functions of the app. I'd really enjoy it more if they could pull back on these added features, or again, maybe just hide them all in one area of the app called 'Social' or similar, but they seemed to be behind every corner. For me, again it just took away from the experience of feeling like I could find the basic information and functions quickly and easily. Thankfully, apps can be can be improved and refined over time, so I feel that most of those concerns are somewhat secondary. If you plan to use it in a way where you can sit down and get through it, then basically 'set it and forget it', I think it will work well for you. But if you would plan to regularly make any tweaks to your meal plans, I think it would be a not-minor annoyance. I'll also mention that this is something my partner and I considered setting up for aging parents, just as a little convenience item to make their lives easier. After working with it, I don't know if I can comfortably go that direction. I definitely don't feel confident that they would have gotten through any of the initial setup themselves, but I also don't think they could make any on-the-fly changes to the configuration even if the initial steps were done for them. My advice to the developers would be: pare down to the basics and make sure they are quick and intuitive. THEN add extras, but remember they are extras and not your primary functions.Ok, so it seems like I'm coming down kind of harsh. All that said, I do think this product will work just fine for use in my own home. The feeder itself is sturdy and has so far been reliable. While I don't have direct experience with a lot of competing products, I had been taking note of some other design issues I'd noted in some of those competitors and waited to try something that seemed to address them. For one, I don't just appreciate the option for plug-in power and battery backup, for me that's an absolute requirement on something like this. The food storage compartment also seems secure, which was a concern I had because I have one cat that will get into ANYTHING edible that is left out. I'm impressed because he hasn't even tried with this, which also tells me the seals are probably decent and he's not being tempted by the smell of kibble. That also leads me to believe that bugs shouldn't be an issue, though time will tell. I also appreciate that the actual food bowl portion is easily removable, as it just snaps into place with a magnet. Being plastic based, it's important to clean something like that regularly and you and I both know that won't happen if it's a pain point. Ideally, I would really like to see this component and the food storage bin being made out of stainless steel, but maybe that's something that could be incorporated in a future revision as well.Let's wrap this up...On the whole, if you are patient and technologically competent enough to get through the configuration of the app itself, it's a good product that I think you'll be happy with.9 people found this helpful”” …”"", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 8, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Must use your cellphone.', 'author': 'Connie M.

The down side of using a machine like this is that I can’t mix their wet food topping in with their dry food like I am used to doing because this is automatic, but this is good to use for times that I am away from home for long times during the day because the cats demand their food at their scheduled time.

At the risk of being overly dramatic: this feeder has literally changed our lives. Whenever we go away, which certain times of year is somewhat frequently, I have someone who comes to feed Kitty her wet food (I have also had an automatic water fountain for several years) and check on her once a day. Because I cannot get someone in more than once a day, I would leave a perpetual feeder full of dry food that would be available to Kitty 24/7. But my tiny-frame, 15 lb kitty is a glutton. Normally when we are here, she is on a strict diet of 1/4-1/3 cup per day of dry food. When we'd go away I'd figure it's only 2 or 3 days several times a year of her having a free-for-all with the dry food, it won't kill her. Well, when we went away a couple months ago, I came home to copious amounts of cat vomit EVERYWHERE... all dry food. I realized for her health and my sanity, I had to find a better option. I researched all of the feeders under fifty dollars (which I felt was a reasonable limit to spend) I found on Amazon and this one had the most positive reviews. The only thing that was annoying was that neither the ad, nor any of the reviewers, stated exactly how much a serving is and, as I said, my Kitty's diet is strict so I made sure I added that detail to my review. 1 feeding dispenses 1 TBSP. kibbles. I'm sure this will vary slightly depending on the size and shape of your kibble. For us, this is perfect. She gets 1 serving every 6 hours except her 8pm serving, which was always her dry food dinner time, she gets 2 servings to total just under 1/3c per day. I thought I would only use this feeder when we went away like I did the perpetual feeder, but this has been so wonderful, it is our new permanent daily feeding station. We never have to worry now about late evenings when Kitty would have to wait for food or if there was a last-minute need to spend the night away and poor Kitty not getting her coveted kibbles untilbover 12 hrs late. She also seems happy to get small portions throughout the day and night rather than all at once and bonus: no more vomiting because she only gets 1-2 TBSP at a time. Another concern was that she is a feral rescue so she is VERY skittish about noises, movements and any new or moved object so I was worried she might be too terrified of it to eat from it. But, after running away for a couple of seconds then approaching cautiously the first 2 or 3 dispenses, her kibble addiction overrode her fear. By day 3, this girl already learned the schedule. She now appears before the bowl about 3-5 min prior to dispense time and waits for it. When we went away last week, my cat sitter messaged she would not be able to arrive to give Kitty her wet food in the morning and would not be there till later that afternoon, so I went on the app on my phone from hundreds of miles away, and was able to immediately dispense Kitty a serving of kibble and also adjust the afternoon feeding to keep her within her total allowed for the day.

I opened it and rummaged around in the “spout” where the food gets ready to be dispensed, and then it started working normally. This is really problematic - every other feeder I’ve tried will alert you if there is a jam and feeding isn’t happening. I have no idea how many feedings she missed, and now I’m not confident this will actually feed as programmed. And apparently there’s no way to discover whether there’s a problem unless you sit and watch whether it’s dispensing, which defeats the purpose.

The Wi-Fi and app control is a great feature that makes change the schedule really easy. My cat also needs to go on a diet because the last feeder’s internal mechanisms broke down/stretched to create larger portions than intended.

You can modify the open/close speed to allow your pet time to get used to the movements of the lid and also can modify how long the lid stays open when they are no longer within the RFID range. Another small detail I enjoy is that you can record a mealtime message in the app, so whenever you have the auto-feeder setup you can have the device say ""dinner time"" or whatever you want in your own voice while it feeds your pet.There are two downsides for me though that really make this not a complete product:First, it would be really nice if they had a live camera/microhpone built in. This would help a lot during the training phase to see how your pet is reacting when going near it, it also would help when you are out of town and want to monitor/speak to your pet.Second, the RFID chip is massive! The picture in the product listingmade me believe that you could slide it on another collar and that\'s not the case. The only way to attach it to the non-original collar is to use a ring (which is included in the box). However, the chip swings around freely and is absolutely massive for a cat. I could see this being a negligible point for a medium-sized and above dog. However, we have a very skittish cat and the RFID chip is bothering her too much throughout the day to make it worthwhile. If they could either decrease the size of the chip, allow pet microchips to be synced or maybe even have some kind of fabric pocket that slides on the collar rather than dangling down, it would greatly improve this product and allow for use even with the most skittish of pets.Overall if those downsides aren\'t the end of the world for you or your pet, then this product is really great! It was packaged nicely, easy to put together, and made with high quality materials. It seems to be a reasonable price compared to like-products on the market and Petlibro has always had great products from the few I\'ve purchased (we also have several of their water fountains, which are amazing).Update: After about a week of use, this product is getting worse. It has issues dispensing food. If the bowl isn\'t virtually empty it will cause a backup and won\'t dispense more food. My cat for whatever reason prefers to eat from the front and sides of the bowl first. This leaves any remaining food at the rear of the bowl . This device registers this as the bowl being full and doesn\'t allow more to be dispensed. Other issues I can forgive, but when the sole purpose of the device is to feed your pets and the device has a flaw that prevents it from doing this, that\'s just a bad product.

My biggest concern was that my cats weren\'t going to figure out how to use it, but they did. Cool features in the app even allow you to schedule food to be dispensed periodically throughout the day, so we set up four small feedings (20 g, 10g, 10g and 20g) to be dispensed for breakfast, lunch, snack and supper. The feeders are kept in separate rooms.After I set up feeding schedules for both feeders in the app, each feeder has now randomly dispensed a full day\'s worth of food (all four feedings) between scheduled feedings. The first feeder did it the same day we set them up. We encouraged the cats to hang around so they could see the food being dispensed. Neither of them were near the dispenser at the time (several feet away). It only happened one time for that one feeder, so we chalked it up to a technology glitch (maybe I didn\'t set it up right, didn\'t save something, etc.) That was on Friday, (a day or two after we got it), and it worked as expected over the weekend, dispensing breakfast, lunch, snack and supper portions at the scheduled times.Yesterday (Tuesday), the same thing happened with the second feeder. Both cats were several rooms away from the feeder, asleep on our bed about an hour after the third feeding time (which they slept through) when a full day\'s worth of food was dispensed - in four consecutive portions, just like what happened with the first feeder a few days before. It still dispensed the last scheduled feeding at the right time afterward.I\'m at a loss. These were not inexpensive. My vet recommended getting something like it so our older cat could eat only her food (and not eat her sister\'s food) - she needs to lose the extra weight.

It seems to be dropping at 10 minutes after the hour at random. I sent an email to Petlibro's support team, so we'll see what they say - but I'm leaning towards this expensive feeder getting returned.First, if this feeder operated from my cat's implanted microchip, it would be amazing. The large, bulky tag that must be worn bothers my cat, and he's constantly trying to remove it from his neck, so I'm unsure if this feeder will work for us. If the tag were smaller, it could possibly work - but I'd really love to not have to have my cat wear a collar at all.The feeder is also much too 'sensitive' to the microchip tag - so if my cat is sitting near / next to his feeder, the door will stay open - allowing his brother to sneak in and eat as much as he wants, or grab a mouth full of food and run off with it. We have one overweight cat who eats all of his brother's food, so this sort of defeats the purpose of having a feeder like this. I'm unsure if this is something that could be fixed via a firmware update, but it definitely has an impact on the functionality.The positives? The hopper is airtight and holds a lot of food, the feeder is beautifully designed, and it was extremely easy to connect to the app (I already have another Petlibro feeder and water fountain). I also love being able to customize it with my pet's name or a message.I'm unsure if we will be able to keep the feeder - we'll likely give it a few days to see if my cat will keep the bulky tag on. The option to use an implanted microchip and having a slightly less sensitive sensor to said chip would easily make this a 5 out of 5, and I'd buy another one for my other cat.

I hope this review helps if you have cats like mine!For reference, I have one orange cat who is food obsessed (Gene). I have another tabby cat who is a grazer (Frank). At the moment I use the SureFeed microchip feeder but there are no doors and no automatic feeding option so I was really hoping the PetLibro one would fill that gap.What I Find Challenging:Bulky RFID Collar:The RFID collar provided is bulky and distracting, particularly for smaller cats. Comparatively, the SureFeed Microchip feeder's microchip reader seems more responsive and less obtrusive. A downsized RFID tag would be so much better here. My cat is so petite!Door Closing Speed:Despite confirming with Petlibro support that the feeder is functioning correctly, the door's closing speed on the fastest setting (1 second) is too slow. My food-motivated cat like Gene, can grab food before the door fully closes when my other cat walks away.Slow Food Dispensing:The slow dispensing of food - if I say my cat needs 2 portions it will spin out 2 portions pretty slowly. For a cat like Frank, who eats modestly throughout the day, the multiple drops required for one feeding can lead to waiting time ,which lets Gene anticipate and interfere with the process.Bowl Design Issues:The round-rectangle bowl shape is not great. Food gets stuck in the corners and it deff causes whisker fatigue. It needs to be raised or not so deep in the corners.What I Like:Auto-Feeder Concept:The automatic feeder with a door is a positive feature, particularly for households with less food-motivated cats on different diets.Monitoring Features:The ability to monitor the cat's eating habits on the app is really cool.Aesthetically Pleasing Design:The clean and sleek appearance of the Petlibro One RFID Feeder is commendable. Some even mistook it for a printer which I thought was funny but a call to its sleek look.Side Bumpers:The side bumpers are effective in keeping food thieves at bay while Frank was actively at the dish.Suggestions for Improvement:Microchip or RFID Tag Options:Offering a choice between microchip and RFID tags, with a downsized and more comfortable tag for cats with microchips, could address the issue of collar bulkiness.Faster Door Closing Mechanism:Enhancing the motor to close the door even faster could prevent food theft and improve the overall efficiency of the feeder.Revise Bowl Design:Rethinking the bowl design, perhaps elevating or changing its shape to prevent food accumulation in the corners, would be beneficial.If it was faster opening and closing as well as putting out food, had a better opening system (microchip or smaller RFID), and a better bowl would be perfect. It just didn't work in our household so instead I bought upgrades for my SureFeed Microchip feeder.Thanks!"", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 26, 2024', 'is_verified': True}]"

Took my cats to the vet and they are over weight, so he asked me to measure and focus on portion control. I used to use one of the 1/2 gallon like jugs that just hang upside down, and my cats were eating all the time whenever they wanted. I'm gone a lot, vets not happy, and I want my cats to be healthy. So I started searching and doing my homework.This feeder is working great for me and my fur babies! It has many ways of controlling the portion. You can set the exact amount of grams to be fed, 6 times daily. So on the app you choose how much you want it to dispense, title of feeding (ex. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack), and you can add a pre-recorded personalized voice message to play when it dispenses their meals.You can choose different recordings for each individual feeding time, or use the same recording for all feedings. I'm only using the one recording I made (ex. Nola, Oreo, Casper, it's time to eat! HERE KITTY KITTY KITTY! It plays the recording 3 times in a row while dispensing the food. Which is nice because if they don't hear it the first time, they definitely do by the third making sure they don't miss a meal.Within the first few days they became trained to the feeder. They can be in REM sleep, hear the recording, then immediately jump up to run and eat! It's actually really funny!The app sends a notification to your phone for every feeding, which prompts me to go in app and check the camera, to make sure all 3 are getting to eat. I can also hear them to make sure they aren't growling at each other, which thank goodness they eat together fine. But if they didn't you can also talk to them in real time from the app.I really like how the app is set up so you can see the camera on the top half of the screen, and the bottom of half you can choose to take a photo, record, listen, or talk. Or you can click the full screen to enlarge the full picture.The only thing I really think could have used improvement is the camera angle seems a bit high, for when they have their heads up close and in the bowl. I can only see the top of their heads. However, I don't know though, because if it were lower it would be too close and if it were higher you wouldn't see them at all. Because when they aren't face down in the bowl I can see them just fine. As a matter of fact I think it has a wide lens because I can see my entire kitchen! Which is a pretty neat bonus feature. I have found the app to be very easy to understand, operate and navigate. It does freeze when in camera view sometimes when I forget to close out the app after using, and leave inactive for too long. But it's easy to close and re-open the app.Overall I have found this to not only meet the needs of fine tuned portion control, but also many other neat features that have made feeding my cats so convenient and most of all FUN! Not only am I feeding them more responsibly to prevent over feeding, but I'm actually enjoying being able to interact with them when I'm not home, checking to make sure they are okay. And it holds alot of food so it's never a chore to feed. I really like this and now that I'm utilizing all of these fun and needed features, I could never go back to my jug feeder. This records every feeding, time, amount fed in grams etc. and stores it in the app. Now I can take this to the vet in a few more weeks to make sure that everything is right for my cats diet, and then he can give me accurate feedback. I hope this helps those who are needing a solution like I did. This would also be great for anyone like me who isn't home a lot or maybe has an unexpected hospital stay, or even use if you have a vacation to go on. This is also nice for those times you can't find a pet sitter on short notice. You can feed, see, talk to, and interact with your fur baby. Holds a lot of food for days when you can't be home which can reduce anxiety in emergency situations. Make sure to place batteries in the compartment in case of power outage. Because if the power goes out while your gone, the feeder will still work as long as you've put the batteries in it.

May not have been necessary but I took my time to gradually introduce them to the feeders, bowls and associated noise.Set up both feeders with small scoop option (nice feature) and placed them on the floor, side by side. Cats, being cats, carefully checked them out. The first few times I lightly placed (lightly dropping) kibble in the bowls; when the cats were comfortable woth the noise and eating from the bowls, I then moved on to manually trigger the feeders so the cats would become accustomed to the noise of the pellets being released (gentle motor whine and kibble hitting the plastic dish) while I was in the room. They were concerned initially with the noise (quieter feline version of coins dropping from a slot machine but their payout was in edible bits.) Once they were comfortable with one mechanical feeding a day, they were settled down enough to eat from the attached bowls without constantly looking around. Now they are somewhat attuned to feeding times and often wait in the room for the units to disperse their kibble.Both cats are enthusiastic eaters but the larger one uses his size to take over what he feels is unclaimed food. It was necessary to synchronize the distribution time and portions so both cats would be fed. Next time I’ll save time by using the power strip method mentioned by another owner; however, I was able to sync them close enough that feeding times are not battles with one winner and one loser. The mechanical mechanisms have worked fine so far. Portions are fairly consistent since both units are set the same setting. Nice to have up to 4 feedings a day and control over the portion sizes per feeding. After checking portion quantity often, I now feel confident that both cats receive the desired quantity per day.Initially, I thought the voice recording would not be necessary since the descending pellets are noisy. I’ve set up the voice recording on one of the units only. It’s a short message which repeats 3 times. This feature has been a useful alert and use it daily.The units are powered by USB cords. We’ve experienced one power outage since the units were set up. Back up batteries were installed; the units were not affected in the least. Again - nice feature.Being able to see the quantity of kibble in the container is a plus. The clear top is secure from opening by pet paws but convenient and handy with fingers.Neither cat has knocked over a unit but have turned them slightly in search of one or two pieces of kibble that bounced out of the bowl. Easy to realign when needed however.Our cats are comfortable with these units. We are very happy with them. Two months in use, they fit our needs now and envision they will continue to do so, hopefully for some time.A few surprises:The directions to replace the large size food rotator with the small size was confusing. Once I figured out one does not need to take the whole unit apart to replace this piece, it all made sense. Replacement in our second unit was quick.Seemed odd to use a 24 hour clock to set feeding times. It works but odd.Would be nice to be able to control the number of times the voice recording is activated.

We have come to discover that he is somehow getting more food than he should have been from this feeder and I need to now scale it back (we all know how cat diets go...). Not thrilled with that and am considering up grading or getting a feeder that uses some sort of weight system when it dispenses the food.

So, I don\'t use it for a few days and feed my cat manually away from the location where the ants were. I let the unit run according to schedule, there\'s no food in it, but no problem (I have the backup batteries installed). So, when I go to use it again after taking care of the ant problem, something is screwy. Previously, when the unit was working, the motor would do its full crank and dispense the food as its supposed to, then there would be one or two short cranks of the motor. I figured it is an alignment thing or something, cause it worked fine. Now, after several tests, all I get are the small cranks and no full crank according to the number of portions programmed. I\'ve removed the batteries, unplugged for a few minutes, plugged in and reset the clock to do a test feeding, or even just tried a manual test, and same thing, no full cranks of the motor. Well, I *think* it did work once, but that was it. And I don\'t think I did anything differently, the motor just worked and then didn\'t again. I\'m at a total loss...Now, reading some of the bad reviews, it seems like the motor dying after only a few months does happen, although not that often based on the product\'s overall rating. In the meantime, I\'ve ordered a different product which will barely arrive in time for a short trip I have this weekend... finger crossed!!!!I\'m going to keep trying to get the unit to work, and if it does, I\'ll have two (assuming the new one is still working; the electronics on these things seem of poor quality, Chinese made), maybe one as a back up, or I\'ll donate it to a shelter.TL;DRThe unit worked great for several months and now the motor doesn\'t seem to be cranking correctly to portion out the food.

First I purchased the HoneyGuardian 4.5L feeder (link below). It was OK. The price was right but a definite learning curve with the programming. The dispensing of food was fine but IT WAS SO LOUD. The first time it went off, the cats and I nearly had heart attacks. We suffered similar reactions every time. I grew up in NYC, across the street from a fire station and had learned to sleep through the fire truck sirens in the middle of the night. But this thing going off at 10pm jangled my nerves. Sent it back.Next I purchased the Rellorus 5L feeder. Not as modern looking as the HoneyGuardian, cheap price and about the same to program as the HoneyGuardian. It was quieter than the HoneyGuardian so despite being bulkier and more boring looking, it was already a better choice. Then, three weeks in it just stopped working.Which brought me to the Wopet 7L feeder. I impressed myself with a spreadsheet comparing capacity, # of feeding bowls, # of meals, battery backup and price which allowed me to choose wisely.This unit did not have a dual feeder but honestly, at this point I didn't care anymore. It cost more money but you know how they say you get what you pay for? Well so far this unit has been worth every penny. Easy to program, very sleek looking, and pretty silent dispensing. The feeding dish is generously sized and those genius cats figured out they can take turns eating.I did not use the voice memo feature on any of these because I am fairly confident that my disembodied voice would just freak the cat out. Cuz it's creepy. Highly recommend this unit - get it!Previously purchased models:Automatic Cat Feeder, HoneyGuaridan 4.5L Pet Feeder for 2 Cats Dogs Food Dispenser Auto Cat Feeder – 6 Meal Portion Control, Distribution Alarm, Programmable Timer Feeder, 10s Voice Recorder (White)Rellorus Automatic Cat Feeders, 5L/21Cups Pet Food Dispenser for Two Cats, Timed Cat Feeder with Double Bowls, 48 Portions 6 Meals Per Day for Cat and Dog, 10s Meal Call"", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States July 29, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Kitty is happy and so am I - UPDATED 2X', 'author': ""Will's Mom"", 'rating': 5, 'content': 'UPDATE 4/1:Wopet customer service responded to my message within 12 hours and within 24 hours let me know a replacement was on its way! I did not expect this at all but am so impressed by their quick action. A++ for customer service and satisfaction. Kitty will be happy to have her feeder back up and running.UPDATE 3/30/21:Well almost two years to the date of purchase, the feeder no longer works. Kitty was acting strange for days and we realized the feeder wasn\'t feeding properly. Tried to reset clock and feeding times - no luck, time just kept flashing but couldn\'t be set. Tried factory reset using their instructions - nothing. Unplugged and took batteries out and turned switch off hoping it would reset itself - nope. We have the basic version (not wifi, nothing fancy) and it just quit. Tried reaching out to manufacturer this morning but haven\'t heard back. Going to the store to buy a gravity feeder so my cat doesn\'t starve. It was great while it lasted.Original review:Works like a charm! This Wopet feeder replaced a ""smartfeeder"" made by another manufacturer that turned out to be a NOT SO smartfeeder! Without any warning or notifications, it stopped feeding my cat last week. How did I figure out that it wasn\'t working? Getting woken up at 3:00am by an angry and starving cat! Multiple attempts to get help went unanswered so I gave up on that company and decided it was time to try a new feeder.I decided it was more important to have an automatic feeder that actually feeds my cat reliably than have the ""smart"" feature so that narrowed down my search. This one was most recommended on various sites/reviews so I figured I\'d give it a go. It happened to be on sale and offered free returns so I had nothing to lose.Received it the other day, programmed it with ease and it has been working like a charm! Kitty is happy to have food coming out and I\'m happy it was so easy to set up. I did have one question when setting up the feeder so I emailed customer service. They responded quickly and were extremely helpful. The new feeder is sleek and takes up little space. There is an inner sleeve that holds the food and is easy to remove to clean which is nice. The dish is plastic but not strange odors or anything. It can be plugged in or run on batteries which work as a back up in case the power goes out - comforting to know in case it happens when we are away.All in all, a great experience.

In my case where I have a mesh Wifi system, and it sends both signals and you can\'t chose which one to connect to (by default 2.4 will connect to 2.4 and 5 will connect to 5) so when the feeder connects automatically to the 2.4 and my phone automatically to 5, Wopet will not allow you to set up. Both the feeder and phone had to be on the 2.4 signal. So what did I have to do? I took a 100\' extension cord and walked around my property when I finally was able to go so far from my house that my phone switched from 5 to 2.4. And so I am sitting in my driveway like an idiot near traffic with this feeder trying to set it up. Much more wasted time before this little trick.Great. finally set up, right? NoMost issues happen when I am not home, when the app and the feeder is most useful. When I am home it\'s all fine. But that defeats the purpose of having it.In the last year I have gotten many messages on the app, where on the event list it has multiple warnings where it ""dispensed excessive food"" at scheduled times. At times it showed that message as well, and I can\'t tell you how many because the app seems to delete old events after a while. So I only have the ones from this past month.At times, I think there was a message that no food was dispensed, but I came home to see traces of food like my dog ate. So then I didn\'t know if and how much my dog ate, and whether I\'ll be overfeeding it or not if I give it more food.Sometimes last minute I know I wasn\'t going to be home, it wasn\'t allowing me to schedule a feed time.And the most annoying of all, more than 3/4 of the time, when I am outside of my Wifi network, the camera won\'t connect. I just get the spinny wheel of death. Which is the main reason why I bought this, so I can watch my dog eat and check in on her because of her age.So at this point its just an expensive dog food storage bin.If you want a camera to watch your pet, just get a real indoor camera from Google or another maker. And maybe figure something else out for the feeding. When I bought it with tax and shipping it was probably around $150, and you can get an indoor Nest cam for $100.If I could I\'d give this back.EDIT: I have decided to edit the review from previous 3 to 1 star because after I posted this review, the company contacted me on the side and offered me return money or another product ONLY if I agree to remove this review.

This product is definitely the first step to helping me out without having to get a cat sitter-- I didn\'t know there was automatic wet food feeders, and iPettie doesn\'t disappoint.The container itself works like a charm. When it transitions, it\'s nice and quiet--love it! And so far it\'s cat proof enough that my desperate kitty hasn\'t been able to tip it over, crack it open, or wiggle her paw into it, while it\'s really easy for me (as a human) to open it, add food, and clean it. The smooth circular shape is ingenious this way. It does take a a good chunk of floor space, in case that matters (I use a large cat kennel at lot to separate my cats, and it is a little cramped.)The holders are a good size. I can put in a 3oz can of food in there with no issue, it maybe maxes out around one 5.5 oz can before you\'re probably breaching too close to the outer cover that\'s covering it.The app is easy enough. it\'s called ""Smart Life"" (must be some generic smart device controller app developed in China) and they can even send firmware updates through it (which is pretty slick). When it connects to my feeder, it\'s pretty simple to add when I want the feeder to rotate (the hardest part was getting the name of the app from the youtube video tutorial, so you\'re welcome). I do wish there was an ""every day"" option, instead of scheduling it again and again each day, but minor stuff. Also minor, the log has the AM/PMs switched (so a planned 8 PM is showing as an 8 AM, and vice versa) but that\'s easy to ignore.The hardest part is the food storage logistics so really not like any problem with the product. The ice packs are great and keep the food cold, but realistically can only keep it cold for...12 hours at most. I refrigerate or freeze some food so it will stay cold longer, but I think it\'s really should be a max 48 hours thing. How it works for me (on a 2 a day feeding schedule):1) rotate out the ice packs (so one in the freezer, refreezing, while one is in the holder)2) only use 4 of the slots, with 3 slots of food on standby over 1 ice pack (the pack can be placed on the rear, it doesn\'t have to only be on the left or right side as pictured)3) for extra longevity, use frozen food that\'s on standby for >24 hrs (the 2 later slots).I think this is a fairly food safe method but we shall see...just thought I\'d put it out there since really that was the hardest part for me, trying to figure out what works for me and my cat. iPettie really made a great tool that makes it possible!', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 22, 2024', 'is_verified': False}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars I can sleep through the night', 'author': 'M. J. Burak', 'rating': 4, 'content': ""One of the hallmarks of feline kidney disease is poor absorption of nutrients. This manifests as the cat being hungry all the time. I can feed him as much as he wants during the day, but he would often wake me in the middle of the night begging for food. I bought this device to feed him a couple of times while I sleep.He's really picky, and won't eat wet food that's been out for more than an hour, no matter how hungry he gets. I was worried he wouldn't eat the food after it's been sitting in the device most of the night, but the ice packs and the seal around the food compartments did their jobs.The app is for ALL of the products this company makes, so it's really basic. Set-up was easy, first using Bluetooth to connect to the device, then adding wi-fi to it so it knows what time it is. Setting the schedule is a breeze. You just move the virtual wheels to the time, then save. And, the app sends a notification when the tray has rotated for a feeding.The only complaint I have so far is that food compartments need to be at least 50% wider. My cat doesn't like squashing his whiskers to get food that got pushed to the sides (whisker fatigue), so he's only eating about half of what I give him. (Of course I'm going to increase the amount, but that means more waste.)Overall, I'm really happy with this device."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States March 3, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great quality and easy to use cat food dispenser with wifi', 'author': 'TigerFish', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'This automatic cat food dispenser is great quality with awesome features and wifi connectivity. It has two removable ice packs that will keep wet food cold for up to 6 hours once the packs are totally frozen in the freezer. They are obviously not needed if only using dry food in the feeder. The storage tray has six large areas for wet and dry food and is also removable from the unit for easy cleaning and is dishwasher safe. The tinted cover locks down into place and will expose one food tray opening per feeding session that can be programmed by using the wifi SmartLife app which can be downloaded to a phone or iPad. Only five of the food openings can be programmed since the sixth one will already be open. The wifi network frequency 2.4Ghz is needed to connect and operate this feeder, which is the same frequency needed to operate most other wifi connected devices in my house such as LED floor lamps. There is a touch control display on the center of the feeder which will display the wifi status and also if there are any other issues. The feeder is powered with a cable that has a USB plug which can be connected to the included wall charger if needed, and the other end is plugged into the bottom of the feeder. The power switch is also located on the bottom of the feeder. There are 4 rubber foot pads on the bottom for better stability of the feeder on hard flooring and to keep it from sliding around. I ordered this cat feeder for use mainly when I am away from the house for one or more days since I have no one to feed my cat when I am gone. I have had several multiple day hospital visits in the past and was always worried about feeding Wolfie. I used to have to leave large bowls of dry food out for him that would end up getting stale after a few days. With this feeder the dry food will stay fresh since the lid fits tight against the base. I can also put his treats in one of the tray openings for him. I recommend this automatic pet feeder to all cat owners who live alone or for those who are always away from their home for any extended time frame.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 29, 2024', 'is_verified': False}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Purrrfect for senior kitties!', 'author': 'TheVoiceOfUs', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'This is a GENIUS device!!

It seems like you get what you pay for and I am hella broke, but really needed something to help me with feeding my own cat while operating a pet care business and traveling without dumping my pet's needs on my roommates or hiring someone of my own to drop in and feed.My priorities for a feeder were dual power sources, controllable portion sizes, multiple feedings (up to 6), functionality of build, removable feeding tray for easy wash, functionality of app, and a securely fastening lid. Every feeder had a few negative reviews and it seems statistical that a malfunction could occur considering the moving parts and reliance on wifi so it was really a game of chance. I do not utilize the voice feature because my cat couldn't care less about a feeding time and grazes all day (hence the desire for multiple smaller-portioned feedings).The feeder was easy to wash, physically set up, and get connected to the wifi. The app was also easy to figure out and I had feedings scheduled within minutes of it being connected to my wifi. I checked the bag of cat food to figure out how many grams a day my cat should be eating and then I measured out 1 feeding portion a few times to check the consistency of the feeder. It came out at 8-9g every time and my cat needs up to 110g a day of her current food, so I broke that down into 14 portions and scheduled them across 5 feeding times to start. She doesn't like when her bowl is empty so I may adjust this, but so far it seems to be working out well. I haven't had any problems with it dispensing food (mechanical or technical) THAT I'M AWARE OF. I wish it had a camera, but that's a feature for a higher price point. I will be monitoring the feeder over the next few days to make sure the schedule works for my cat and that it operates without fail. I'll happily update my review after a few months to see if it's still functioning at 100%.EDIT 11/13/23:My only complaint at the moment is that I can't figure out how to erase the accidental recording I made that plays every time I dispense food.

We actually dont keep any food in the second chamber so if our new kitty starts crying during the night we can just do a manual feeding on chamber 2 and the voice recording will still play and distract her. The only complaint is that one of the reasons I purchased this model is that it worked with the Smart Life app. All the other devices I have using the Smart Life app also work with Google Assistant so I can control that way. This unit works with SL of course but is not able to be controlled by Google. Not a deal breaker but would have been that much nicer.

It's just a little safety net in case something happens that keeps the sitter away for longer than planned.The spinning feeders are cool and all but the openings are small and they can only be timed in a way that only keeps them going for 2-3 days. It could be 5 days each one but only if there is only one feeding per day and then we'd definitely need 4 feeders instead of the 2 we have.We bought this nice, big programmable feeder and it is a godsend. I love that we can adjust how much food comes out each time and can do so many feedings in a day. We have 4 cats so it's nice to be able to do lots of small feedings throughout the day so no matter what, each cat will likely get to nibble. We setup a camera and they do all take turns being first to the bowls and after they realized that it will keep providing food throughout the day, they stopped being so excited about it and stopped gobbling all the food all at once. Now they just eat what they need and leave the rest for another kitty.Even while not traveling, we have it setup to do 1 feed at about 3am. That way they get a snack and don't wake us up for it.The food container is huge! For a large dog it might seem a little small but for 4 spoiled kitties it can easily keep them fed for 2 weeks with lots of feedings each day. That should be plenty of time for us to get home if something happens to our sitter.It's also really nice that it can be battery powered or plugged in. Two of our cats love to chew on cords so anything that avoids cords while we are out of town is a huge bonus.The reason I knocked 1 star off is because the instructions aren't super clear and you have to push the same button soooo many times to get the desired setting and if you accidentally push it one too many times you have to cycle through all the numbers again.

The normal version is essentially the same because the Wi-Fi version which is no longer supported by the app that it claims to use to make it WIFI/smart. It used to work but they updated the app and prostituted it to ads and charging a premium which is a scam (the feeder no longer is supported. It use to pop up as a device but no longer is. Essentially, you are paying 20 dollars more for a tiny little WI-FI symbol at this point. Not worth it.The regular and Wi-Fi version is the same. They both feed six times and have different portion settings. Ok simple break down to show you how easy it is to set up because no one does a good job at explaining this. You have three buttons on the left, one in the middle and three on the right.1. To adjust the time simply click the first button on the right-hand side (time icon) that has the clock icon. Then use the second button below the first button located on the right to set the hours, and the third to set up the minutes. It is set up in the 24-hour format.2. To cycle through the servings do the same thing as step one except a tiny different. First click the ""time icon"" located on the right on the right and then the ""power/meal button"" on the left-hand side. This will allow you to cycle through the six portions (the meal button only cycles you through the portions).3. While cycling through the six cycle servings, you can add the size of the portions while on said cycle by clicking the second button on the left-hand side that has a ""small bowl"" logo (the one below the power/meal button which cycles you through the 6 servings). The bowl button determines the size servings. One is the smallest portion, and two is significantly more than the ""one"" portion (tinker around to see what fits your pet\'s needs). When on the first, second, third, etc... You use the hour and minute buttons on the right-hand side to set the time you feed.4.The middle button just lets you feed an extra ""one"" size portion. However, I have found that the longer you hold it the more it will release on the ""one"" portion.5. Finally, the last button that we have not covered is the third button on the left-hand side. It is the record button with a ""microphone"" icon. Hold it for about 5 seconds, until it turns red and keep it held. While red record a message you want your pets to hear.Caution: the reset button will reset all your setting and is NOW USELESS for the Wi-Fi version.AGAIN, the WI-FI version is now useless. It used to work, but now it does not after the app update. I bought a second one on 12/22/2023 so I could feed my cats, one who has a condition and is restricted to eating in tiny portions to now she will be going from 6 feed per day to 12 feed per day except smaller. This means I have to fill these feeders much less than I use to. The first one I bought in 1/1/2023 (don\'t remember exact date) and the app is useless.In conclusion, the feeder is great, but paying, an extra 20 dollars is now pointless. I will be calling for a partial refund because it is now gone from convenient to scam. However, this was not enough for me to give these feeders anything lower than 4 stars. I just wouldn\'t feel right doing it.I hope this saved you all time, money, and frustration. Since the manual doesn\'t explain how to function it. They use to provide a great manual but no longer do.

Had the dry food already in the 2nd bowl, just needed to add her bisque to the 3rd bowl while she was still drinking.

My cat every so often will spit her dry food back up, when I read that the eating position might have something to do with it I thought let\'s give this a try. Really nice looking setup. 1-2-3 to put together. Everything was securely pkg. Allen wrench included to install the legs. Even included little rubber squares to put on the ""feet"" to protect & prevent the eating station from moving around. I also had another reason for getting this particular item. My robot vacuum cleaner has a bad habit of trying to climb the tray that I have my little ones\' food on. This should certainly eliminate the climbing.

Yours may have different opinions. While the bowls come with no assembly instructions, you really don't need them as there's only 2 pieces to attach and common sense will tell you how they attach.

It does still slide around a little on my hardwood floor, so I put it on a silicone mat which helped a lot.One downside is that the bowl does not 'snap' to fit into the feeder. There is a little rectangle cutout on the feeder and a protrusion on the bowl that lines up with it to fit the two together, but it doesn't lock into place. One of my cats pulls on the bowls and has misaligned the bowl with the feeder a few times.The app is simple once you have it set up.

One thing I was confused about - it wasn't in the instructions and the app is not clear at all - was what the 'feed number' meant in the app. Reading the product description, I *think* what this means is the number of 'servings' of food the feeder dispenses.

Oops!I have been pretty pleased with it so far. The steel bowls have some marks on them - my cat is a messy eater and has dribbled water into the bowl, which left water stains.

The first time I set it up (on not a so strong 2.4 ghz WiFi) it spun and spun. I finally hit the back button and it showed that it was already connected. So there’s some glitch there (but it DID connect). Additionally, when I connected it to the 5ghz network it didn’t do that. So who knows. Just watch for it when you’re trying to add it and if it seems like it won’t pair.This would have been our second feeder so I’m familiar with the concept. It has a sound bite that’s about 20x the volume of our previous one. I actually had to turn it off because it scared me and the cats (and would have woken us up to my shrill “kitty… come here kitty …. Time to eat…. Smooch smooch smooch”. 😖)Also, it was a little wobbly and felt cheaply made. I wound up trying it with none of the legs though as my cats like to plop like loaves on the floor when they eat. The lid just felt like thin plastic compared to the lid I was used to with my other dispenser.Ultimately what did it in was the design of dispensation. We use freeze dried chicken that I cut up and it wasn’t steep enough for the chicken to actually come out of the shoot. I tried it with actual kibble (which my cats wouldn’t eat- they don’t like kibble) and it worked like a charm. But with the lighter, oddly shaped freeze dried chicken bits, it just wasn’t a match. (I know it CAN work from the previous dispenser which is finally getting old after 3 years).I think if you use kibble, you don’t work from home (so you’re not being scared by your voice and you think your cat will enjoy it), and you have carpet or a way to help with the potential wobble of the legs, this could be a really great dispenser. It has great camera quality, you can choose to set up notifications when there’s movement in front of it, there’s two way audio on it, and you can remotely dispense treats from it.

Either way, we dumped it all, stopped putting the larger food in and after a couple of days, it once again jammed.

This helped a lot and we were able to dispense the food, albeit it was still messy as the plunger part is difficult to push at times.Additionally, the nipple tip dispenser had the writing coming off when I opened it. Did someone return this and the seller repackaged it to the next unsuspecting Amazon buyer?My disappointment is this: Where is quality control in the manufacturing of these? Are they selling this to us ""sucker"" Amazon buyers who cannot see what we are getting? Are sellers getting defective products cheaper and then selling them on Amazon? Once upon a time defective products would not be sold or if something was wrong it would be identified as that and sold for cheaper price. Or be trashed, never leaving the facility.It seems not everyone got a defective product, but many of us did unfortunately. If you are lucky and get a good one that works then great.

That last point isn't really important to me, but it may be important to others.I'll note that we managed to spill liquid on and destroy the manual, so we had to figure stuff like programming and portion sizes out without instructions, and it was doable if a little complicated.One other thing worth noting is that it seems to dispense much more consistent amounts at higher portion sizes than smaller ones, but I expect some of that is due to the shape of the hopper feeder and the size and shape of the kibble itself. For example, on the smallest portion size it will dispense anywhere from about 10-20 kibbles at once.

So pleased to be able to feed our feral cat and not have to hire someone to put food out for us. This WiFi feeder has paid for itself.

Cats prefer to keep food and water separate (instinct is that killed prey would contaminate drinking water) so their water fountain is in another room.Our orange boy was never really food motivated, so was content in eating wet food after his sister, but lately his appetite had picked up and I had noticed them both crowding to eat from the small bowl at the same time. The it was time to find a triple diner so that they both could have their own serving space while still having the communal dry food.This server is nice in that it is rather compact, it’s in foot print in our small kitchen, but also that it doesn’t have a broad shelf which can impede access to the bowls and get messy. Generally our older black cat liked to access her bowl from the side, so also the kind that have feet on the sides were comfortable for her. This one leaves a nice open area for them to access at various angles.As far as quality, the drilled holes to make it adjustable in height are not made at the same angle at as the center arms, so even at the top most setting, they stick out further through the top and at a different angle that what is shown in the stock photos. They appear somewhat flush in the description, but they’re not. At the lower height I’d think they’d actually be more of a nuisance and look worse.No complaints on the strength nor quality of the bamboo sticks that these came with. The extras were nice just in case, but ours went in smoothly and hold just fine.My biggest complaint is about the bowls that this came with. We opted for the stainless steel version, and the bowls are just too deep to be whisker friendly. They are smaller in diameter than the standard cat food bowl, so I guess the depth was to allow for more volume of food, but this just doesn’t work for my senior cats.Our previous double dinner had enough width to accommodate smaller ceramic fruit bowls which we could swap out which each serving for cleanliness, so I was really hoping to find a third-party dish to use in this particular triple diner. Finding shallow bowls approximately 12cm in width was a challenge to say the least.I ended up find that OurPets DuraPet 6oz cat food bowls that hold 3/4 cup fit well and are nice and shallow. They’re more pricey each, but worth it for the convenience ad pet experience.Overall, this works for us, but I would probably recommend a different one with standard 5.5in bowls.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 18, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Wow!

This bowl is an improvement over the last one in that she leaves less food on the counter, probably because this bowl is higher -- but it is not the food on the counter that bothers me; instead for some reason she drops food into the water side (a lot more than her old bowls). The dry food quickly turns to mush, clogging the filter. I took out the filter and it was better, as at least it did not clog up and stop running leaving them with no water, but I still have to clean it every few days. While the stainless steel is easy to clean, it is not so easy to clean the entire water bowl as the wire runs through the base. This probably would not be a problem with wet food, and would not be with all cats, but is for my cat. I just clean it more than I want but I like the water feature so much I am willing to do this. If I go away for a long weekend, I will just not put the dry in the other side but leave out a couple bowls of dry far away on the counter! A design improvement would be to run the electric wire through the lid so you could easily clean the base. Also beware that they will have no access to water in a power outage -- all the water will be in the base.

I'm Shocked How Good It Is!"", 'author': 'Ryan A. Leemhuis', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'A little background first. We had previously used the Crown Majestic feeder for our cat. It worked fairly well although it was a bit ugly, would occasionally jam and the portion sizes were very hit and miss. We used it until its power connection internally broke and it would only run off batteries which was difficult to keep up with.So that led me on my search for a replacement. There are a lot more options now than there used to be. My main features I was looking for were wifi control and reliability.I found it difficult to narrow down my choice as I found varying reviews and some claimed that a model was terrible and some said it was amazing. I eventually settled on the Petkit mini feeder from a cost and design perspective. First of all, it looks great. I love the thought that went into the design from the magnetically attached bowl to the jumper that allows the DC adapter to easily disconnect from the wall should you need. I was a little nervous about how much food could be stored but upon seeing the compartment this is a good amount for a cat. I find we need to fill it once every 2 weeks or so.That brings us to the worst part of the product. Lets just be clear here...the app is decent...but there are some language oddities and the setup did not go according to design. I am a techy and I initially tried pairing the feeder with my phone. It got fairly far into the setup but kept failing out during the wifi pairing process. I then tried my wife\'s phone and it did the same. I then happened to notice that the feeder was already showing on the app\'s dashboard and sure enough it had been paired even though the app claimed it had failed. I don\'t know why this occurred but be prepared for some setup issues.Once setup, however, the app is great. The food portion sizes are accurate and on demand feeds occur nearly immediately. The schedule is easy to setup and food is distributed on time. We use prescription ""disc-shaped"" food and other feeders claimed they weren\'t compatible. We have had ZERO issues with this machine getting jammed or having any issue with our food. It is actually very fun to watch the little door open on the machine and then the food dump out.For the cost, this feeder is a steal. It is so much better than our previous feeder it makes me wonder why I didn\'t upgrade earlier. My only suggestions for improvement would be to further improve the app and instructions translations. There are some real English oddities (which you can see in the product\'s amazon page as well. In addition, the setup process obviously needs some improvement too as it failed twice for me and some how magically appeared on my apps dashboard after this fail. Other than that, the feeder is perfect. It feels very high quality and the mechanics seem sound. HIGHLY recommended.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 29, 2019', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars PetKit Mini - Small Pet Feeder - Review', 'author': 'AirplaneCatBlue', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""The PetKit Mini feeder is attractively and elegantly designed. It looks like it belongs in an art museum.The PetKit Mini feeder is the ideal automatic feeder for my needs. What I like best is that it precisely delivers very small meals (as little as 1/20 of a cup or 5 grams) to my overweight cat up to 10 times per day. In my case I had been feeding my cat 20 grams of cat kibbles twice per day... or 40 grams. My cat was waking me up at 4 AM begging for more food. The PetKit Mini stopped the begging behavior! With the PetKit Mini I was able to schedule 8 feedings of 5 grams each... for a total of 40 grams per day... but spread out over the course of the day and night. This way my cat gets precisely fed her reduced ration and eliminates my tendency to give her a little extra when she begs.The PetKit Mini has improved my cat's relationship with me. She no longer relies on me for food. With the PetKit Mini she visits me often and regularly because she wants my company... not because she wants food. And it has improved my relationship with my cat since I am no longer irritated by her pestering behaviors at 4 AM when she gets hungry.The engineers who designed the PetKit Mini payed very close attention to critical details that separate this feeder from the pack. I studied them all before I made my purchase decision. The silicone rubber paddles that meter the kibbles into the rotary dosing cups are designed to flex so the kibbles don’t jam in the mechanism.The engineers used silicone rubber gaskets to seal out moisture at the feeding door and food reservoir lid. Then they provide a replaceable desiccant pack (those little packs that you often find in a box of new shoes) that absorb any moisture that might otherwise accumulate in your dried food. You can imagine that if your kibbles absorbed moisture from the air and swelled up like a sponge that they wouldn’t feed well in the mechanism. It also keeps the food fresher and prevents mold growth I would think.I found the PetKit Mini was easy to set up. It did help that I had an $8 electronic scale so I could better measure in grams how much I had been feeding my cat. I had been using a very small measuring cup. It was a lot easier to weigh the kibbles than to try to measure the volume of food.I measured the amount of food the PetKit Mini delivered with each feeding. I did this 8 times just to see how repeatable the feedings were. With my dry kibbles the average amount of each feeding was 4.97 grams. Pretty good if you were targeting 5 grams! (The standard deviation was 0.31 grams… who remembers what a standard deviation is???)Since I am only feeding my cat 40 grams per day the food reservoir is large enough for storing a 37 day supply. I can just check the food level once per month to be safe… but the PetKit Mini is designed with a monitor that will alert me when the food is low. What a great feature! It will also remind me every 30 days to replace the desiccant pack. I found some after-market desiccant packs on EBay that will fit the PetKit Mini because I couldn’t find any OEM packs online.This is a great automatic WiFI cat feeder! I liked it so much I bought a second PetKit Mini for my daughter for Christmas. She too has an overweight cat (though not for long).

Unboxing and putting everything together is easy, and so far the feeder has been reliable. That said, I think the app is a lot more complex than it needs to be, and while that can be updated and changed over time, it's important to know what you're getting into.When you go through setup of the feeder and app for the first time, I think the experience is a bit all over the place. There are instruction stickers on the feeder itself, there is a booklet of instructions, there are QR codes and links within the booklet to scan to get to videos that you have to watch for further steps, and then there's setup within the app itself... etc. I think it's just a few too many layers of info and could be pared down significantly. Once everything is setup and you're trying to actually use the app, those same issues of unnecessary layers/ complications continue. The app tries to get you to schedule meals based on feeding recommendations for your pet, so you have to setup a profile for each of your pets first. This sounds minor, but it's quite detailed, and includes a whole lot of information that isn't truly necessary just to make a recommendation for feeding quantity. In the end, a truly informed recommendation would really require nutrition information about your pet food itself, so the whole exercise is a bit silly. I was left feeling a bit unsure of how much of this information I *really* needed or wanted to complete. Once you have been asked about various details for your pet, then you need to schedule fixed meals for each, and again I do appreciate that they tried to include a lot of options for customization, but it's just too much. For one, how do they propose that you make sure the right pet eats the right meal, etc? I think it would be much easier to remove those options, or hide them behind an advanced mode, and just let you set a very simple schedule with set times and quantities. K.I.S.S. you know? Given that the app doesn't interface with bluetooth trackers or smart catboxes or anything like that, I'm not sure I see any need for the pet profiles at all! It just adds complexity for no discernible reason.Beyond the actual cumbersome data entry requirements, I found the interface to be not very intuitive. I had difficulty finding the settings that I actually wanted to look for and find out more about, such as the Alexa integration, and kept getting lost in layers of social media integrations and gamification... which, why? I was looking into trying out the Smart Home integration options, but do I need a community and messaging platform for my smart feeder? Maybe this is more of a cultural thing, I believe the company is based in China, but I just don't need this kind of fluff cluttering up the basic functions of the app. I'd really enjoy it more if they could pull back on these added features, or again, maybe just hide them all in one area of the app called 'Social' or similar, but they seemed to be behind every corner. For me, again it just took away from the experience of feeling like I could find the basic information and functions quickly and easily. Thankfully, apps can be can be improved and refined over time, so I feel that most of those concerns are somewhat secondary. If you plan to use it in a way where you can sit down and get through it, then basically 'set it and forget it', I think it will work well for you. But if you would plan to regularly make any tweaks to your meal plans, I think it would be a not-minor annoyance. I'll also mention that this is something my partner and I considered setting up for aging parents, just as a little convenience item to make their lives easier. After working with it, I don't know if I can comfortably go that direction. I definitely don't feel confident that they would have gotten through any of the initial setup themselves, but I also don't think they could make any on-the-fly changes to the configuration even if the initial steps were done for them. My advice to the developers would be: pare down to the basics and make sure they are quick and intuitive. THEN add extras, but remember they are extras and not your primary functions.Ok, so it seems like I'm coming down kind of harsh. All that said, I do think this product will work just fine for use in my own home. The feeder itself is sturdy and has so far been reliable. While I don't have direct experience with a lot of competing products, I had been taking note of some other design issues I'd noted in some of those competitors and waited to try something that seemed to address them. For one, I don't just appreciate the option for plug-in power and battery backup, for me that's an absolute requirement on something like this. The food storage compartment also seems secure, which was a concern I had because I have one cat that will get into ANYTHING edible that is left out. I'm impressed because he hasn't even tried with this, which also tells me the seals are probably decent and he's not being tempted by the smell of kibble. That also leads me to believe that bugs shouldn't be an issue, though time will tell. I also appreciate that the actual food bowl portion is easily removable, as it just snaps into place with a magnet. Being plastic based, it's important to clean something like that regularly and you and I both know that won't happen if it's a pain point. Ideally, I would really like to see this component and the food storage bin being made out of stainless steel, but maybe that's something that could be incorporated in a future revision as well.Let's wrap this up...On the whole, if you are patient and technologically competent enough to get through the configuration of the app itself, it's a good product that I think you'll be happy with."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 12, 2020', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '1.0 out of 5 stars The PetKit app is nearly useless for this feeder!

Unfortunately, Petkit and Amazon failed to disclose that the app isn't ready for the hardware.

Interesting is that I have the PetKit Puramax automatic litter box with my cats' weights entered correctly. The feeder links to the info but changes the weights without any input from me. Another FAIL?Next it asks me to enter their cat food. I feed Purina Indoor Cat Food, a very common dry cat food pellet available in any American grocery store. Instead of a simple-to-use barcode reader that searches online and enters the food analysis for me, I have to enter the analysis manually.

I almost took off 1 star for the pain in the *** setup and user interface, bit in spite of the those annoyances, I like this feeder so much that I decided to give it the full 5. I\'m so happy that it can dispense portions in increments as small as 1/20th of a cup. I use this feeder to give my cat a small snack in between her normal meals, so that tiny portion size is greatly appreciated. It\'s so nice to be able to adjust the feeding from my phone. We used to go out to eat and hang out with friends until late at night all the time and we always worried about making our cat wait for dinner until we got home, but now (once we can finally go out again) we can just use our phone to give our cat some dinner as soon as we realize we won\'t be getting home until late.Another thing I like about this feeder is that the build quality is really nice. The food tray attaches magnetically so is easy to take off, clean, and re-attach. The food sits inside an inner basket within the feeder, so it keeps all the food crumbs contained.

I'm Shocked How Good It Is!"", 'author': 'Ryan A. Leemhuis', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'A little background first. We had previously used the Crown Majestic feeder for our cat. It worked fairly well although it was a bit ugly, would occasionally jam and the portion sizes were very hit and miss. We used it until its power connection internally broke and it would only run off batteries which was difficult to keep up with.So that led me on my search for a replacement. There are a lot more options now than there used to be. My main features I was looking for were wifi control and reliability.I found it difficult to narrow down my choice as I found varying reviews and some claimed that a model was terrible and some said it was amazing. I eventually settled on the Petkit mini feeder from a cost and design perspective. First of all, it looks great. I love the thought that went into the design from the magnetically attached bowl to the jumper that allows the DC adapter to easily disconnect from the wall should you need. I was a little nervous about how much food could be stored but upon seeing the compartment this is a good amount for a cat. I find we need to fill it once every 2 weeks or so.That brings us to the worst part of the product. Lets just be clear here...the app is decent...but there are some language oddities and the setup did not go according to design. I am a techy and I initially tried pairing the feeder with my phone. It got fairly far into the setup but kept failing out during the wifi pairing process. I then tried my wife\'s phone and it did the same. I then happened to notice that the feeder was already showing on the app\'s dashboard and sure enough it had been paired even though the app claimed it had failed. I don\'t know why this occurred but be prepared for some setup issues.Once setup, however, the app is great. The food portion sizes are accurate and on demand feeds occur nearly immediately. The schedule is easy to setup and food is distributed on time. We use prescription ""disc-shaped"" food and other feeders claimed they weren\'t compatible. We have had ZERO issues with this machine getting jammed or having any issue with our food. It is actually very fun to watch the little door open on the machine and then the food dump out.For the cost, this feeder is a steal. It is so much better than our previous feeder it makes me wonder why I didn\'t upgrade earlier. My only suggestions for improvement would be to further improve the app and instructions translations. There are some real English oddities (which you can see in the product\'s amazon page as well. In addition, the setup process obviously needs some improvement too as it failed twice for me and some how magically appeared on my apps dashboard after this fail. Other than that, the feeder is perfect. It feels very high quality and the mechanics seem sound. HIGHLY recommended.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 29, 2019', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars PetKit Mini - Small Pet Feeder - Review', 'author': 'AirplaneCatBlue', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""The PetKit Mini feeder is attractively and elegantly designed. It looks like it belongs in an art museum.The PetKit Mini feeder is the ideal automatic feeder for my needs. What I like best is that it precisely delivers very small meals (as little as 1/20 of a cup or 5 grams) to my overweight cat up to 10 times per day. In my case I had been feeding my cat 20 grams of cat kibbles twice per day... or 40 grams. My cat was waking me up at 4 AM begging for more food. The PetKit Mini stopped the begging behavior! With the PetKit Mini I was able to schedule 8 feedings of 5 grams each... for a total of 40 grams per day... but spread out over the course of the day and night. This way my cat gets precisely fed her reduced ration and eliminates my tendency to give her a little extra when she begs.The PetKit Mini has improved my cat's relationship with me. She no longer relies on me for food. With the PetKit Mini she visits me often and regularly because she wants my company... not because she wants food. And it has improved my relationship with my cat since I am no longer irritated by her pestering behaviors at 4 AM when she gets hungry.The engineers who designed the PetKit Mini payed very close attention to critical details that separate this feeder from the pack. I studied them all before I made my purchase decision. The silicone rubber paddles that meter the kibbles into the rotary dosing cups are designed to flex so the kibbles don’t jam in the mechanism.The engineers used silicone rubber gaskets to seal out moisture at the feeding door and food reservoir lid. Then they provide a replaceable desiccant pack (those little packs that you often find in a box of new shoes) that absorb any moisture that might otherwise accumulate in your dried food. You can imagine that if your kibbles absorbed moisture from the air and swelled up like a sponge that they wouldn’t feed well in the mechanism. It also keeps the food fresher and prevents mold growth I would think.I found the PetKit Mini was easy to set up. It did help that I had an $8 electronic scale so I could better measure in grams how much I had been feeding my cat. I had been using a very small measuring cup. It was a lot easier to weigh the kibbles than to try to measure the volume of food.I measured the amount of food the PetKit Mini delivered with each feeding. I did this 8 times just to see how repeatable the feedings were. With my dry kibbles the average amount of each feeding was 4.97 grams. Pretty good if you were targeting 5 grams! (The standard deviation was 0.31 grams… who remembers what a standard deviation is???)Since I am only feeding my cat 40 grams per day the food reservoir is large enough for storing a 37 day supply. I can just check the food level once per month to be safe… but the PetKit Mini is designed with a monitor that will alert me when the food is low. What a great feature! It will also remind me every 30 days to replace the desiccant pack. I found some after-market desiccant packs on EBay that will fit the PetKit Mini because I couldn’t find any OEM packs online.This is a great automatic WiFI cat feeder! I liked it so much I bought a second PetKit Mini for my daughter for Christmas. She too has an overweight cat (though not for long).

Unboxing and putting everything together is easy, and so far the feeder has been reliable. That said, I think the app is a lot more complex than it needs to be, and while that can be updated and changed over time, it's important to know what you're getting into.When you go through setup of the feeder and app for the first time, I think the experience is a bit all over the place. There are instruction stickers on the feeder itself, there is a booklet of instructions, there are QR codes and links within the booklet to scan to get to videos that you have to watch for further steps, and then there's setup within the app itself... etc. I think it's just a few too many layers of info and could be pared down significantly. Once everything is setup and you're trying to actually use the app, those same issues of unnecessary layers/ complications continue. The app tries to get you to schedule meals based on feeding recommendations for your pet, so you have to setup a profile for each of your pets first. This sounds minor, but it's quite detailed, and includes a whole lot of information that isn't truly necessary just to make a recommendation for feeding quantity. In the end, a truly informed recommendation would really require nutrition information about your pet food itself, so the whole exercise is a bit silly. I was left feeling a bit unsure of how much of this information I *really* needed or wanted to complete. Once you have been asked about various details for your pet, then you need to schedule fixed meals for each, and again I do appreciate that they tried to include a lot of options for customization, but it's just too much. For one, how do they propose that you make sure the right pet eats the right meal, etc? I think it would be much easier to remove those options, or hide them behind an advanced mode, and just let you set a very simple schedule with set times and quantities. K.I.S.S. you know? Given that the app doesn't interface with bluetooth trackers or smart catboxes or anything like that, I'm not sure I see any need for the pet profiles at all! It just adds complexity for no discernible reason.Beyond the actual cumbersome data entry requirements, I found the interface to be not very intuitive. I had difficulty finding the settings that I actually wanted to look for and find out more about, such as the Alexa integration, and kept getting lost in layers of social media integrations and gamification... which, why? I was looking into trying out the Smart Home integration options, but do I need a community and messaging platform for my smart feeder? Maybe this is more of a cultural thing, I believe the company is based in China, but I just don't need this kind of fluff cluttering up the basic functions of the app. I'd really enjoy it more if they could pull back on these added features, or again, maybe just hide them all in one area of the app called 'Social' or similar, but they seemed to be behind every corner. For me, again it just took away from the experience of feeling like I could find the basic information and functions quickly and easily. Thankfully, apps can be can be improved and refined over time, so I feel that most of those concerns are somewhat secondary. If you plan to use it in a way where you can sit down and get through it, then basically 'set it and forget it', I think it will work well for you. But if you would plan to regularly make any tweaks to your meal plans, I think it would be a not-minor annoyance. I'll also mention that this is something my partner and I considered setting up for aging parents, just as a little convenience item to make their lives easier. After working with it, I don't know if I can comfortably go that direction. I definitely don't feel confident that they would have gotten through any of the initial setup themselves, but I also don't think they could make any on-the-fly changes to the configuration even if the initial steps were done for them. My advice to the developers would be: pare down to the basics and make sure they are quick and intuitive. THEN add extras, but remember they are extras and not your primary functions.Ok, so it seems like I'm coming down kind of harsh. All that said, I do think this product will work just fine for use in my own home. The feeder itself is sturdy and has so far been reliable. While I don't have direct experience with a lot of competing products, I had been taking note of some other design issues I'd noted in some of those competitors and waited to try something that seemed to address them. For one, I don't just appreciate the option for plug-in power and battery backup, for me that's an absolute requirement on something like this. The food storage compartment also seems secure, which was a concern I had because I have one cat that will get into ANYTHING edible that is left out. I'm impressed because he hasn't even tried with this, which also tells me the seals are probably decent and he's not being tempted by the smell of kibble. That also leads me to believe that bugs shouldn't be an issue, though time will tell. I also appreciate that the actual food bowl portion is easily removable, as it just snaps into place with a magnet. Being plastic based, it's important to clean something like that regularly and you and I both know that won't happen if it's a pain point. Ideally, I would really like to see this component and the food storage bin being made out of stainless steel, but maybe that's something that could be incorporated in a future revision as well.Let's wrap this up...On the whole, if you are patient and technologically competent enough to get through the configuration of the app itself, it's a good product that I think you'll be happy with."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 12, 2020', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '1.0 out of 5 stars The PetKit app is nearly useless for this feeder! Portion size is randomly variable....', 'author': 'D', 'rating': 1, 'content': ""The PETKIT app is poorly implemented and largely non-functional. I bought this Petkit Automatic Cat Feeder because it promised being able to identify my two cats and calculate their food requirements based on weight and metabolic needs. Using this info I wanted to program daily feedings customized for each cat. This product is another example of decent hardware with poor software implementation. Unfortunately, Petkit and Amazon failed to disclose that the app isn't ready for the hardware. I consider this failure to be a bait and switch scam and I'd return it but I already tossed the package because the delivery person left it in the rain without a plastic wrap for protection.Linking the app and feeder was easy. Connecting to my home router/wifi was easy. It even ran an automatic software upgrade so I know I have the latest, greatest app software. So far so good.Next task is to program my two cats into the Feeding Calculator. Entering the name is easy. Enter the weight? The app reverts to a default weight of 6.8 pounds every time. So it fails to update the cats's weights. FAIL! There isn't any obvious way to edit the cat information either. So another FAIL! Interesting is that I have the PetKit Puramax automatic litter box with my cats' weights entered correctly. The feeder links to the info but changes the weights without any input from me. Another FAIL?Next it asks me to enter their cat food. I feed Purina Indoor Cat Food, a very common dry cat food pellet available in any American grocery store. Instead of a simple-to-use barcode reader that searches online and enters the food analysis for me, I have to enter the analysis manually. Okay, needlessly complicated but okay.The app lets me program the feeding schedule but I'm unable to vary the portion size. I ran a few trials and the portion size isn't consistent.

I almost took off 1 star for the pain in the *** setup and user interface, bit in spite of the those annoyances, I like this feeder so much that I decided to give it the full 5. I\'m so happy that it can dispense portions in increments as small as 1/20th of a cup. I use this feeder to give my cat a small snack in between her normal meals, so that tiny portion size is greatly appreciated. It\'s so nice to be able to adjust the feeding from my phone. We used to go out to eat and hang out with friends until late at night all the time and we always worried about making our cat wait for dinner until we got home, but now (once we can finally go out again) we can just use our phone to give our cat some dinner as soon as we realize we won\'t be getting home until late.Another thing I like about this feeder is that the build quality is really nice. The food tray attaches magnetically so is easy to take off, clean, and re-attach. The food sits inside an inner basket within the feeder, so it keeps all the food crumbs contained.

One was fast, the other was slow, so over the course of a week, we would have a gulf of about 2 1/2 minutes which resulted in hurt feelings and competition. Cue the third cat and we tried a different brand. That one kept time a little better, but we were still struggling with clocks that would never be synchronized and it was a chore to always update 3 feeders every few days just to ensure the cats were fed at their respective stations at the same time and no one had an opportunity to eat theirs and steal another's in the time it took for food to be dispensed.I had my eye on this, as it's WiFi enabled, and we already have the automatic litter box, so we were familiar with the brand. I bought a couple to trial and they have worked wonders so far, the internet connectivity ensures they are dispensing at almost identical times, rather than relying on an onboard clock. So, we purchased a third, and will purchase a fourth and fifth once the kittens are a bit bigger.Setting up the feeding plan is a breeze and refilling couldn't be easier. I also like the shallow bowl because it does keep whisker fatigue to a minimum as they don't have to bury their heads too deep to reach their food.Set up was a breeze as well. It was very easy to connect as the device was easily recognized and firmware updates took moments without any failures. The app works great with virtually no delays in input - want to give them a little snack? Tap the snack button, select your serving size and it dispenses as soon as you make your choice.For the price and the features, it's a no brainer. There's simply no reason reason to pay more for less with competitors, at least those who are respectable names in this market, and not just a random brand that has popped up trying to offer a cheap alternative with a janky app.5/5 stars."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 28, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Super happy I risked this feeder!!', 'author': 'Amazon Customer', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'UPDATE**: still 5stars. Update is bc people are saying this has a bad wifi system. I set up a separate 2.4G network off my main 5G network, and it works perfectly fine. I get 2-3 wifi Bars on my phone from where the feeder is so I do have a good network connection. Only have about avg 700-800mbps wifi and a ton of other items in the home like security cameras and smart plugs with multiple roommates also tech heavy, so the issue is definitely not with the feeder (unless they got a defective one idk). I did have my power go out once but due to the battery backup the feeder still dispensed food on time and reconnected to the wifi when the power came back on without me having to do anything. Also read someone said the app didn’t work with an iPhone. I have a newer iPhone and the app was super easy, as if I was downloading any other app (Instagram, etc.). Updating bc I don’t want people to overlook this feeder bc of a few reviews that don’t always apply.So this feeder only had 8 reviews when I ordered it which is way low for my usual trust with a new brand. however, MY CATS LOVE THIS FEEDER. They weren’t intimidated by the size or layout. Very intuitive for my cats to use. Love that it’s also a plain clean look with the app (so far so good) and doesn’t have those tacky looking buttons on most automatic feeders. Extremely clean design which was a big factor in buying. The lid That seals is also nice. I picked up the feeder and turned it sideways just to see if it would spill, and it stayed secure with the latch they used.The installation was incredibly easy and straight forward. I expected it to be more intense. My cats use purina one kitten food mixed with purina one probiotic health adult food, and the dispenser has done very well with portion size mixed. Will update this if anything changes.The App really impressed me with how it logged my cats’ weights and age etc to help with portion control. I needed this bc I wasn’t sure how much to give my kitties after them being on an open bowl meal (but got too chunky hence the feeder & I am a student and not always home etc).Only Pros at this Point. I got the stainless steel option and highly recommend that bowl as opposed to the plastic. Your cat will appreciate it and it’s a lot easier to clean.The Green Color is exactly how the picture looks.

I\'ll update if it stops working or something. The app isn\'t super sleek and displays my feeding history partially in Chinese, but it\'s not too confusing either, and the feeder quickly connected to my iPhone on a 2.4G network. Set up was really easy, 2-3 minutes, and mostly I just use the ""extra feeding"" button, although the recommended meal plan seemed appropriate if all my cat ate was dry food, and was easy to edit. I like the green color and the stainless steel bowl.I\'ve only had it for a few weeks, with no problems. My cat is underweight, not food-motivated, usually eats raw or wet food, and was recently diagnosed with kidney issues and maybe isn\'t really supposed to be eating dry food anyway. However, he often refuses to eat his wet food, especially prescription food, before I leave for work. It\'s better for him to eat dry food than not eat at all, so I use this to send him small amounts food throughout the day and give me some peace of mind that if he wants to eat, he can (and that the food isn\'t super stale). I do wish the feeder could tell me if the cat has eaten any of the food in the bowl, and how much, instead of just logging how much has been dispensed. This way I could track his eating and avoid adding more food when he hasn\'t eaten... but maybe that\'s a lot to ask from a feeder? Anyway, having a remotely controlled feeder also means that if I find I\'m not going to be home for scheduled feeding times, it\'s not such a big deal, which is good because I live in a city with unpredictable traffic. I\'m pretty satisfied.Edit: I\'ve had the feeder for a while now to feed two cats on a schedule. It does have some bugs. The main issue is that it will double-dispense food randomly, some 10-20% of the time. I always receive a notification that it\'s working normally and has released the scheduled amount of food, but if I am home, I can see/hear that it dispenses, and then after about 30 seconds dispenses the same amount again, this time without sending any notification. This isn\'t as bad as if it were not dispensing any food at all, but it\'s a pain because one of my cats will happily overeat and get sick if I\'m not home to intervene. The only solution seems to be making meals even smaller so that when it double dispenses, it\'s not so much extra. I also somewhat frequently receive notifications that the feeder is jammed or low on food when it is not (maybe twice a month). The feeder has only actually jammed once.

Whether I'm at work, running errands, or traveling, I can easily monitor my cat's feeding schedule and adjust it as needed with just a few taps on my smartphone. The convenience and peace of mind this provides are priceless.I love that I can schedule up to 10 meals per day, allowing me to customize my cat's feeding routine to fit his needs perfectly.

It's sturdy and reliable, with a sleek and modern design that looks great in any home. The food storage compartment is spacious enough to hold a generous amount of kibble, reducing the need for frequent refills.Overall, I couldn't be happier with the PETKIT Automatic WiFi Cat Feeder.

I don\'t know why companies don\'t sit regular people down with their product and say ""set this up"" it might help. After getting connected, started a meal plan. I did not have to do a pet profile as some others reported. If I did, I would have stopped.Smallest portion is 1/10 cup. I usually feed her less as she gobbles and then throws it up, but I tried it.So I set up 4 feeds a day. This is tedious with scrolling wheels for times for each feeding. After that you are to hit ""start plan"". I get message ""request incorrect"". what\'s that mean? If you go back a page it erases your plan and you have to start over.Start over. Same thing. 4 times 16 entries. I guess I wasn\'t smart enough to just try one time! Finally I figured out it had lost internet connection. App will show ""Petkit is running"" which means you are connected to the machine but not the internet? Reconnected, and it save the next plan I put in. On the settings page it will show ""online"", why not have it on the home page??? Why not notify you lost connection??.

Town', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I bought this for a colony of about a dozen feral cats (all but a couple TNR\'d) that live in the woods near my house. I set them up some beds and a big food bowl in a shed but raccoons and possums were stealing the food. (And I was tired if going out in the rain to fill the bowl.) So I got this feeder and set it up in the shed. So far, this has held up well. The raccoons and possums can only steal 1/2 cup at a time. The raccoons get pretty aggressive when the bowl is empty but they haven\'t managed to get the lid off the new feeder. I\'ve seen them tossing it around on the security camera but the feeder\'s held up fine. I eventually attached it to the floor of the shed.I haven\'t set up a schedule because feral cats are terrible at telling time. If it\'s empty when I check the security camera, I hit ""Extra feeding"" on my phone and dump 1/2 cup in the bowl. It took the cats about 2 days to figure out that the noise means food. Sometimes I\'ll see 3 or 4 of them sitting in a semi-circle around the bowl waiting for me to hit the button.I\'ve run several brands of cat food thru it (whatever\'s on sale in bulk) and it\'s pretty consistent with the portion despite the different sizes and shapes of the kibble. I\'ve never had it get stuck with food left in the hopper. It gets down to the last few pieces every time.It would be nice if it was easier to clean. You have to take out 4 screws to take the dispenser chamber off and really get in there with a brush to get the rotating part clean. If the chamber was a twist-lock and the rotating part came out easily, it\'d be much better.My only other real complaint is the AAA batteries. They should be AA.

I’ve spent an incredible amount of time researching Cat Feeders ever since 2020 when PetNet (feeders) went out of business. They were the best in the industry, hands-down! and now I’m stuck with TWO of their $150 paper weights, essentially. I’ve searched far and wide for replacements. So on Amazon Prime Day, July 12, I pulled the trigger on a deal for this ELEMENT SOLO feeder. I’ll be returning it promptly before my 30 day money-back guarantee runs out.1st - the amount of information that you MUST input just to set up a feeding schedule is by far very un necessary. You have to create a profile for your animal, you have to enter their height, their weight, their age their type, then you need to input their food brand, THEN verify if it fits in the feeder, and THEN enter the ingredients and what %percentage of moisture and ash etc. etc. None of that is necessary when you’re using a measurement you already know and what type or amount of food you’re going to dispense. You just want to set up a schedule to have it done. BTW the plug is quite large, so I you’ll waste the space beside it, and above it, which is very unfortunate.2nd -my cat is on a strict food diet. His dry food portion of his diet he receives 1/4 (ONE QUARTER) cup of dry kibble (IAMS) TWICE a day to totaling 1/2 (ONE HALF) cup of food per day.By the third day, this feeder gave me issues, dispensing the incorrect amount of food. Sometimes it dispensed 16 kibbles. Sometimes it gave 48 kibbles. Sometimes it gave 62 kibbles. None of those equaled 1/4 cup as I tested it out for EACH of their dispensing measurements PRIOR to using it. The closest I could get to 1/4 cup of their measurements was 3/10 so I used that and set up a feeding plan per their requirements to automatically feed two times a day every 12 hours using the 3/10 dispensed amount. They use FIFTHS (1/5) measurements so it’s a little confusing trying to find what worked for 1/4 cup dispensing amounts. Then within that problem lies another one that’s even bigger. After posting a question about an accurate amounts, dispensed, and then reaching out to their support team, I found an answer. This feeder will only feed an APPROXIMATE amount of their dispensed portion (of 3/10 cup). Let that soak in for a minute. Give it a second. Really let it soak in.Now, let me give you a scenario. … Dr tells you, based on your weight, height and the food intake you can eat (lets use RICE) 1 cup of Rice per meal for a total of 3 cups rice per day. Ok Doc, great. I can do that.So, on your first meal, I hand you … oh, let’s say maybe 2/3 cup, and on your second meal, I hand you let’s say maybe 3/4, on your third meal, I hand you oh maybe 7/8th. You’re an adult, a senior even, so you “understand” what you’re allowed to have per meal and your rice is right there, in that square thing that makes a noise and gives you your rice but it’s not giving you what you’re allowed to have each meal. Would you be happy? Or full? or satisfied? Or always thinking about food and how to get it out of that thing. Because if it’s edible (& sometimes even if it’s not edible) you’ll attempt to get it and eat it. Because all you do is EAT, SLEEP, POOP/PEE, PLAY & PURRTo finish, I would like to quote the review of another Amazon verified purchase user, Jessica (3 years ago! man I SHOULD’VE dug deeper)“ Jessica4.0 out of 5 starsVerified PurchaseBasic features work well, unnecessarily complex app makes setup a painReviewed in the United States on May 12, 2020I think my title basically says it all, but I'm not really a brief person so here goes...On the whole, I'm very pleased with the quality of the build of this product, and the ease of filling and cleaning, which are really paramount concerns for something like this. Unboxing and putting everything together is easy, and so far the feeder has been reliable.That said, I think the app is a lot more complex than it needs to be, and while that can be updated and changed over time, it's important to know what you're getting into.When you go through setup of the feeder and app for the first time, I think the experience is a bit all over the place. There are instruction stickers on the feeder itself, there is a booklet of instructions, there are QR codes and links within the booklet to scan to get to videos that you have to watch for further steps, and then there's setup within the app itself... etc. I think it's just a few too many layers of info and could be pared down significantly. Once everything is setup and you're trying to actually use the app, those same issues of unnecessary layers/ complications continue. The app tries to get you to schedule meals based on feeding recommendations for your pet, so you have to setup a profile for each of your pets first. This sounds minor, but it's quite detailed, and includes a whole lot of information that isn't truly necessary just to make a recommendation for feeding quantity. In the end, a truly informed recommendation would really require nutrition information about your pet food itself, so the whole exercise is a bit silly. I was left feeling a bit unsure of how much of this information I *really* needed or wanted to complete. Once you have been asked about various details for your pet, then you need to schedule fixed meals for each, and again I do appreciate that they tried to include a lot of options for customization, but it's just too much. For one, how do they propose that you make sure the right pet eats the right meal, etc? I think it would be much easier to remove those options, or hide them behind an advanced mode, and just let you set a very simple schedule with set times and quantities. K.I.S.S. you know? Given that the app doesn't interface with bluetooth trackers or smart catboxes or anything like that, I'm not sure I see any need for the pet profiles at all! It just adds complexity for no discernible reason.Beyond the actual cumbersome data entry requirements, I found the interface to be not very intuitive. I had difficulty finding the settings that I actually wanted to look for and find out more about, such as the Alexa integration, and kept getting lost in layers of social media integrations and gamification... which, why? I was looking into trying out the Smart Home integration options, but do I need a community and messaging platform for my smart feeder? Maybe this is more of a cultural thing, I believe the company is based in China, but I just don't need this kind of fluff cluttering up the basic functions of the app. I'd really enjoy it more if they could pull back on these added features, or again, maybe just hide them all in one area of the app called 'Social' or similar, but they seemed to be behind every corner. For me, again it just took away from the experience of feeling like I could find the basic information and functions quickly and easily. Thankfully, apps can be can be improved and refined over time, so I feel that most of those concerns are somewhat secondary. If you plan to use it in a way where you can sit down and get through it, then basically 'set it and forget it', I think it will work well for you. But if you would plan to regularly make any tweaks to your meal plans, I think it would be a not-minor annoyance. I'll also mention that this is something my partner and I considered setting up for aging parents, just as a little convenience item to make their lives easier. After working with it, I don't know if I can comfortably go that direction. I definitely don't feel confident that they would have gotten through any of the initial setup themselves, but I also don't think they could make any on-the-fly changes to the configuration even if the initial steps were done for them. My advice to the developers would be: pare down to the basics and make sure they are quick and intuitive. THEN add extras, but remember they are extras and not your primary functions.Ok, so it seems like I'm coming down kind of harsh. All that said, I do think this product will work just fine for use in my own home. The feeder itself is sturdy and has so far been reliable. While I don't have direct experience with a lot of competing products, I had been taking note of some other design issues I'd noted in some of those competitors and waited to try something that seemed to address them. For one, I don't just appreciate the option for plug-in power and battery backup, for me that's an absolute requirement on something like this. The food storage compartment also seems secure, which was a concern I had because I have one cat that will get into ANYTHING edible that is left out. I'm impressed because he hasn't even tried with this, which also tells me the seals are probably decent and he's not being tempted by the smell of kibble. That also leads me to believe that bugs shouldn't be an issue, though time will tell. I also appreciate that the actual food bowl portion is easily removable, as it just snaps into place with a magnet. Being plastic based, it's important to clean something like that regularly and you and I both know that won't happen if it's a pain point. Ideally, I would really like to see this component and the food storage bin being made out of stainless steel, but maybe that's something that could be incorporated in a future revision as well.Let's wrap this up...On the whole, if you are patient and technologically competent enough to get through the configuration of the app itself, it's a good product that I think you'll be happy with.9 people found this helpful”” …”"", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 8, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Must use your cellphone.', 'author': 'Connie M.

This is why we docked a star.

When my cat is stressed out by being assist fed and I'm stressed out by feeling bad for her I'm thankful for how easy these are to use.Note- always put the tip of the syringe in the side of your cat's mouth so your cat doesn't aspirate the food into his/her lungs. Push small amounts at a time.I love that the 'food' syringe lists both ml (same as cc) and teaspoon amounts!***Update, August 2013-I have had to (unfortunately) use the food syringe of this set 3-4x/day every day for the last 8 days. I never throw it in the dishwasher or wash with regular soaps. The most I do is put it in nearly boiling water, sometimes with a drop of white vinegar (kills bacteria from cat's mouths) and let sit until the water cools. The numbers and markings are beginning to lightly rub off but so far, so good. I'm posting a picture of the comparison between the syringe I've been using and the brand new one I got today.Sometimes the blue plunger sticks slightly which I thought was the food in the syringe but after testing my brand new syringe I realize it's actually the wearing of the syringe/plunger. I've read that you can use a tiny bit of oil (olive, coconut, etc) to lubricate the plunger.Also, if feeding exact increments of food is important know that there will be some food (if feeding pureed/mixed cat food) left on the 'bottom' of the blue plunger; I'd say it's about 0.5ml- 1ml of food. Also, there will be about 1ml of food left in the syringe tip that you can't possibly feed. So, in total you MAY lose roughly 2ml of food/meds when using these syringes.For now I'm leaving my review with 5 stars but depending on how worn the syringe becomes in the next few weeks I may have to downgrade to 4 stars."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 19, 2012', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Great for very small pets', 'author': 'J. de la C', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'Four Paws Pet Easy Feeder set was particularly helpful in feeding medicine to my ailing dog.

I've got to say that this is the best for assisted feeding of a small pet.

Although you have to re-fill it to complete the feeding it is well worth it since it's a smooth operation and less stress and distress on the animal parent and the animal being fed.

It was hard to push through all the way even without anything in it. The food would not come out. Like other reviewers said this does not work with a cat !!! Thought I was doing something wrong until I went back and saw the lower rated reviews and the video. The reviewers are correct. I was wondering why some people rated it so hightly.I ended up cutting the narrow tip, thinking maybe I just needed the wider part (The 2nd part of the tube that is a little wider than the tip). Alas, I did not have anything to properly cut into the wider part so I ended up with a stump of the narrower tip. :-( However in doing this I did discover something. Where the narrow tip and the middle part of the dispenser join, there was a small piece of plastic partially blocking the hole. One would be unable to see this if it had not have been cut. We took a piece of metal and pushed it through to get rid of that small piece of plastic and make the hole a little wider. This helped a lot and we were able to dispense the food, albeit it was still messy as the plunger part is difficult to push at times.Additionally, the nipple tip dispenser had the writing coming off when I opened it. Did someone return this and the seller repackaged it to the next unsuspecting Amazon buyer?My disappointment is this: Where is quality control in the manufacturing of these? Are they selling this to us ""sucker"" Amazon buyers who cannot see what we are getting? Are sellers getting defective products cheaper and then selling them on Amazon?

My robot vacuum cleaner has a bad habit of trying to climb the tray that I have my little ones\' food on. This should certainly eliminate the climbing. It should even beable to clean under the eating station. Found a lot of dry kibble under the tray when I removed. Just a bit embarrassed. The bowls are really nice white ceramic and the wooden frame is smooth, no splinters and appears to have a stained finished. I\'m hoping the size of the bowls are not too small. Perfect for dry food and bisque, but my cat drinks a lot of water. I figure I can use the bisque bowl for additional water when I leave for work.

First I put the new bowls as her first choice, then later moved it further away from the other bowls so she'd had to choose go to it if she wanted to use it. The results: She preferred this dish for eating. But for water she completely avoided this bowl unless the flat bowl was empty. She would walk past it to drink from her flat bowl, and when it was further away still went immediately to her flat raised bowl. So what does this tell us? Really just my cat's preferences. Yours may have different opinions. While the bowls come with no assembly instructions, you really don't need them as there's only 2 pieces to attach and common sense will tell you how they attach. But for some inexplicable reason, they chose to use an allen wrench as opposed to a screwdriver. My only guess it that you'd need a really short handled screwdriver to attach the legs.

It is also cool that you can check food and water levels easily through the little windows.I am taking off a star due to the following:Firstly, there is no leaflet or manual explaining how the thing goes together or what the parts are. The box is just a brown blank one. I had to go back and peruse the rather lengthy Amazon copy for the item (which lacks clarity from a bit of a language gap) to learn that the blue thing in the water bowl is to keep the cat’s whiskers dry. I guess it minimizes splashing too. There was also a packet in the water bottle's nozzle assembly that I presume is some kind of charcoal filter. If so, it is very cheap, so much so that it's probably wholly ineffectual. On the off chance it’s some sort of silica thingy to keep things fresh for shipping, I tossed it. There is no explanation in the product’s write-up on Amazon that I saw, though I did not read every word. Anyway, the assembly is otherwise self-explanatory.Secondly, the seal of the top doesn’t seem very airtight, and the size of the food reservoir is pretty big. Air can of course get in from the bottom anyway, since simple gravity is how it operates. As a one cat owner, I think the kibble would get stale before it is all used up if I fill up the whole thing. I filled it only about halfway, so I guess that’ll work.Thirdly, as others have mentioned, I can tell it’ll be unwieldy to clean. You’d have to take out the water bottle, dump out the water, and empty out the food side prior to a thorough cleaning. It can see that process being a little annoying. No giant deal, but it is true. If the bowls had lift-out inserts, it might make it easier.Lastly, though the price is fair enough, as a very frugal shopper, I had to give a little “humph!” After I got it together. It is a very basic item, basically just some molded plastic and a bottle with a simple valve, and I’m inclined to see it as around $10 overpriced. But what isn’t?!Overall, I do think it is a good item, and I think it will be fine"", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States November 15, 2023', 'is_verified': False}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect size', 'author': 'LWT', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Easy and ready to use right out of the box.

The one positive is that it does hold a lot of food and water, but that is about the ONLY positive.The thing I hate the most is that it is HORRIBLE when you are trying to clean it. If your cat is anything like mine, she accidentally spills food into the water side, and it ends up disintegrating and getting dirty pretty quickly. The little spacer/riser in the water area is a total waste and dirt collector as well. So anyways, when you get ready to clean the water side, you have to worry about all the food on the other side when you are trying to dump the water since this thing is NOT detachable. Pretty much the only way to clean this thing (mostly the water side) without spilling food EVERYWHERE, is if you emptied the entire thing. Even if you tried to empty it all to clean it, that is not the easiest task. The cylindrical piece that holds in the food and water does not clip in or snap in place and it moves VERY easily (AKA SPILL HAZARD). Therefore the only way to empty it to clean it is to wait for it to get empty... or hold the top & cylinder plastic thing VERY precisely as you CAREFULLY dump the food out of the bottom or top - pick your poison.The other annoying thing is that the opening where the food comes out is not very slanted, so you have to force the food out with your hands every couple days.Bottom line, this product was very poorly designed, and I do not recommend it unless it is last resort."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 5, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent!', 'author': 'Ashley “Rudy”', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Just as advertised', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 29, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars A Game-Changer for Pet Care', 'author': 'Gilbert', 'rating': 4, 'content': ""This product is a true game-changer for pet owners.

Just so-so for wet food use.', 'author': 'PA', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'Super easy to use, program, re-program, and wash. (For those reviewers that have issues with the trays not aligning, it\'s because you didn\'t read the simple instructions. There is a very easy fix that re-aligns them perfectly every time. This unit is extremely user friendly.)The unit is comprised of (i) a base that the freezer packs are inserted into, (ii) a bowl/plate that has 5 numbered compartments (numbered 0-4), which you lay on the base so that the compartment numbers on the bowl/plate match up with the corresponding numbers on the base, and (iii) a lid that has a hole cut out of it for one compartment only. The first compartment (number 0) is exposed, which you can consider the ""starter"" compartment (leaving it empty, or filling it with food if you want to); the other 4 compartments are covered by the lid. You can set the timer for one, two, three, or four compartments. It remembers your programs, so you don\'t have to reset again, or you can remove a timer (not using that compartment) or adjust a compartment\'s timer very easily. When the programmed time arrives, the bowl/plate rotates inside and exposes its corresponding compartment and your pet can eat the food from it. There is not a bell or an alarm. The pet hears the unit begin to rotate. They get used to the sound in a couple days, and then the rotating sound trains them that it\'s chow time. It\'s very simple and works great.However, for wet food, this unit is good up to about 5 hours as that\'s about as long as the thin freezer packs will keep the food cool (this review is written during the winter - I suspect the freezer packs will last a shorter time during summer months). Because I don\'t trust wet food sitting at room temperate for hours, I end up only using one or two of the compartments. For example, if I want to leave my house at noon and come home at 9pm, that means I can program feedings until only about 5pm, and as a result the cats don\'t get fed from about 5pm until I get home at 9pm. It is better to have one or two feedings while I\'m out than none though. If you feed your pet a combo of wet and dry food, the unit will be great for you because you can give them one or two wet feedings at the beginning and then follow with dry feedings and not have to worry about bacteria.The rest of this review is in regards to cats only:Initially, the cats are startled by the unit moving, and are, of course, curious cats but not sure what to do with the thing. If they don\'t get it, just kind of put their face by the food compartment and they\'ll realize it\'s food and eat up.They can smell the food in the other unexposed compartments and if they want it, they will try to get it - although they cannot break into the unit. One very determined kitty did scratch up the lid trying though - luckily, this is good, thick, quality plastic so their efforts were in vain other than cosmetically damaging the unit.The cat\'s head kind goes into the compartment when they eat, and their whiskers will smush against the sides of the compartment. Although the compartments are very easy to wash, there\'s a bit of a design flaw - the bottom edges of the compartments are too right-angled and food gets pushed up to the edges and is hard for the cats to get at. It would be better if the compartments were designed with scooped edges. So the cats end up eating as much as they can get to, and then literally have to walk around the unit to eat more, then walk around the unit again to eat more - so they have to ""work"" for their food. If they don\'t want to work so hard, there ends up being uneaten food at the edges.I don\'t see what happens because I\'m gone, but a few times the unit was moved a few feet away from where I placed it. I don\'t know if one of my cats is trying hard to get to the other compartment\'s foods before it\'s time, or if the unit is getting pushed around while they are trying hard to eat the food from the bottom edges. The unit has never been tipped over though.Overall, this is a great unit and I recommend it.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States March 22, 2020', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Awesome product!', 'author': 'Baguazhang', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I bought 2 Cat Mate C50s a couple years ago, after much online research that led me to the conclusion that wet food feeders are all garbage. The Cat Mate C50 model was the best that I had found at the time -- even with their many flaws.My cat sitter broke one feeder and then I broke the second. (It dropped my about 7 feet off a shelf.) I reassembled it\'s simple components and it worked fine. But then I bought the new Cat Mate C500 to replace the first feeder.It\'s a great product. Compared to everything else on the market for wet food pets, the old Cat Mate C50 was the best. Now the relatively new Car Mate C500 is much much better still.Basically, all of the pesky little faults were solved: no battery compartment cover, poor meal timing accuracy, timer cover easily removed by cat (he would screw up the timing and get all of his meal much sooner), my cat could cheat by advancing food tray one position, timing arm and cam had to be set up correctly for product to work properly, etc.I created workarounds for most of the Cat Mate C50\'s flaws. No big deal But that\'s not the case with the Cat Mate C500.All of the pesky little faults were solved except one: for my wet food cat, the tray depth and corners makes it awfully difficult for him to eat all of each meal. Even when I place the food in the middle of a tray, my cat inevitably nudges food into the corners as he eats.However, an additional problem was created with the digital timer: the Cat Mate C500 delivers 4 meals within a 24 hour period.The old Cat Mate C50 model allowed meals to be distributed over 4 days. Since my cat eats four meals a day, I would use two Cat Mate C50s. Which was great for 2-day weekend trips.1 or 2 Cat Mate C500s can be used for such a weekend scenario, depending how often your cat(s) eat.Being much less complicated to set up correctly, I feel much more confident that the CMC500 will deliver every intended meal when I\'m away. That\'s HUGE.According to instructions, three AA batteries last 12 months. Which is awesome; however, I wish the CMC500 included a battery strength display. (The instructions also show a ""low battery indicator"" [Image 2, #2], so maybe it will eventually show up once battery power declines to a certain point.)For a weekend trip, I recommend freezing almost all of the meals before setting up the feeder. Use the 2 freezer packs included with the product.

The timed turntable works and setting it is simple; there is nothing complicated to the mechanism. If you're dispensing dry food, it's just fine. My interest was in keeping wet food cold. The unit by itself, with both cold packs installed, will keep pre-frozen wet food cold for around 12 hours. At 15 hours, everything is room temperature. I built a styrofoam enclosure that was able to stretch the window to around 36 hours maximum. The final version holds an extra three ice packs. I've attached my controlled test results, which were not stellar. If you don't want wet food sitting at room temperature for more than a few hours, I wouldn't recommend setting it's dispensal time at longer than 12 hours. Freezing it first can stretch it a bit, but not much. All told, the ice packs don't do much at all. So unless you absolutely need a set amount of food dispensed at set times, a regular gravity feeder is probably better. If you are using all five bowls within 24 hours, it might be ok for wet food. Just don't expect it to be a cooler. It's most certainly not that.And after all of this I realise, of course, that a cat that will happily eat garbage and drink from the toilet hardly cares about spoilage.

It's not too loud, but makes a buzzing noise loud enough to cue the cat. Three main points sell me on this feeder currently: 1) the gears lock between feeding sessions, so she can't push the chambers around to reach her next meal early, 2) there are holes built into the bottom of the feeder where you can either screw it into a piece of wood or (as we did) use zipties to lock it onto a larger object so the cat can't flip it (it's not heavy, so that's definitely a possibility), and 3) it comes with a freezer pack (though we haven't tested this out yet).

Part of this review is my actual review of it and the other part is to call out another review that has completely misunderstood how this thing works.First off, I think it will take some time (maybe a few days) teaching them that they don\'t need to rely on us humans for food anymore and instead can go sit and wait by the feeder for food. That\'s why these feeders were purchased and that\'s why I\'ve got my fingers crossed since they like to wake my husband and I up starting at 6am every morning and don\'t get fed until at least 7am. So they\'re whiny, meowy, and restless for at least an hour each morning and it\'s just gotten to be too much. And then when they want dinner they again start meowing and whining and getting restless around 2:30pm but don\'t get fed until 4pm. I will try to remember to follow up with their progress in a few weeks.As for the review with inaccurate information: A Courtney from the UK (international review) wrote a review back in 2018. They were complaining about two things. Number one, they said it wasn\'t clear that you could schedule the same feeding time over multiple days (1 meal a day for 4 days). That\'s literally the first part of the instructions under the ""meal time setting"". Maybe instructions from 2 years ago were different but the ones I received were so blatantly clear that I don\'t understand how they could misinterpret that section.Number 2, they state the timing function is over-engineered, whatever that means. It\'s not. Important: The display screen automatically displays the meals in chronological order. This is simply so you know the schedule. This does not indicate when the next meal will come. What\'s listed as meal number 1 is not necessarily the time that the next meal will come. What determines when the next meal will come is the clock on the feeder. Let\'s say you feed your pet at 6:30am, 10am, 4pm, and 9pm. Assuming you set the clock to match your phone/watch/anything else that tells time and you fill all the compartments up and give your pet its first meal just after 4pm (because you just got the feeder delivered at 3:30) the next time the feeder will rotate is 9pm because that\'s the next time that will occur that day. Even though it\'s listed as meal number 4 (because it\'s the last one of the day) on the display screen, it\'ll be the next time the feeder rotates based on a 12 hour day (if you choose, you can change it to a 24 hour day). Again, if you read the instructions it\'s very clear. Meal 1 is not the first time the feeder will rotate it\'s just 1 meal out of a maximum of 4 that you can schedule. It doesn\'t matter the order that you enter the meals because it automatically displays the times into chronological order from AM to PM and this is stated in the instructions.So another example based on my timing above: if you enter all the times mentioned above and then first feed your pet at 10am, the next time it will rotate is NOT 6:30am but 4pm because that\'s the next time that will occur during the day because that\'s just how time works. They\'re like alarms you set on your phone.I can\'t believe I\'m getting this worked up over an automatic pet feeder. Maybe something should be changed about the scheduling if some people are having this hard of a time. Or maybe they just need to work on their reading and understanding skills.I just really hope my pets stop whining for food.***Update***It\'s been 11 days since we received the feeder and this is what I have to say: The cat realized pretty quickly that the feeder is what serves up the food each meal now and not the humans. Her whining as stopped HALLELUJAH. The dog does not whine either anymore for the most part, but she will still usually hop on and off the bed once or twice in the morning once she sees the cat approach her feeder down the hall (we live in a shotgun style condo, all one level with one hallway that goes from one end of the condo to the other). I think the dog does this for three reasons: 1) She knows her food is coming soon because the cat is on the move. 2) She is anxious because she knows the cat will try to eat her food if it is left unprotected. Luckily the cat\'s feeder turns like 15 seconds before the dog\'s so the cat is already eating by the time the dog\'s feeder turns. 3) She likes to be near us at all times. The back and forth between the bedroom and her feeder in the kitchen is part excitement, part protection, and part wanting to still be near her humans who are still sleeping. If my husband or I were to get up at 6am (they get fed at 6:30am), they would both still go nuts though and think that we were about to feed them because it\'s close enough to 6:30am and they can\'t tell time. The same happens in the afternoon. It\'s ingrained in their minds. Years and years of us humans feeding them will do that. I don\'t know if that habit will ever break but we completely ignore them if they do this. Overall, this setup is a huge improvement and makes mornings so much more pleasant for me.The ice packs. I think they are better than nothing. I wish the unit was made of a more insulating material. Luckily, since I bought two units and only one is needed for wet food, I use the two ice packs for the dry food unit as replacements for the wet food feeder. Ideally I\'d say the ice packs should be replaced every 4-5 hours. I usually change it every 6-8 hours, sometimes longer than that. The smell of the wet food has never been an issue and the cat has no issues with the temperature of the food either. Overall, I\'m not too concerned about the ice pack situation. The replacements are only like $17 for a pair so if you need an additional set that\'s not a bad price. Whenever I change out the ice packs, both animals freak out for a few minutes but then quickly chill out. I try to change out the ice packs within a few hours of them eating so that it\'s not close to the next feeding timing. If I changed them closer to the next feeding time (say 2pm and their next meal is at 4pm), they would remain anxious and restless for the next 2 HOURS until the feeder turns at 4pm.Restocking the feeders. My husband and I have a decent set up for this. Every other morning, the feeders need to be refilled. We scheduled it that way. I think we may eventually adjust to every other evening but we\'ll see. Anyways, husband takes the dog out for her morning walk, the cat is usually passed out on the bed again after inhaling her breakfast so now is my time to refill both of them. I lock the cat in the bedroom, lock myself in the second bathroom where her food bowl is kept (to keep the dog away, she\'ll eat it if we don\'t, side note - check out Door Buddy if your dog likes to eat cat poop or cat food) and fill up 4 out of the 5 compartments. Then I do the same for the dog food. Cleaning these things is easy. Water and a tiny bit of elbow grease get any wet food residue off. We decided not to use the exposed compartment so that we are never the ones actually placing the food down for the animals to eat. I want them to really get used to the feeder serving their food and not us. So after a refill, the feeders go back down with one empty compartment open and four full compartments covered. The dog comes back in from her walk and immediately knows that food has been dealt but can\'t access it (she\'s a beagle, everything she does revolves around what she smells and where her next meal is coming from. My husband thinks she can smell the fresh food from outside of our condo. I don\'t doubt it). She frantically sniffs around but then gives up shortly after. Sometimes the cat will hear me opening the cans and will be waiting by the bedroom door meowing like she\'s about to die (so dramatic) but once I come out and she sees there\'s no food out for her she\'ll go back to bed.Size of compartments. My beagle eats 1/2 cup of dry food each meal. This is the perfect size for that. You could probably fit 3/4 cup of dry food in there. Not sure about anything more than that. Cat gets half a can (size of the smaller tuna cans) and there is plenty of room in it - non issue.So, overall, the animals have figured it out and I am happy. Is this thing perfect, no? But it\'s a huge improvement on my situation. If you have animals that whine and meow and beg for food leading up to each meal, I strongly recommend this automatic feeder.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 17, 2020', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars A no-frills workhorse', 'author': 'Elizabeth James', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I love this feeder.I use the 3-meal version, in conjunction with a hopper style dry food feeder. My cat, bless his dumb little head, lived outside for 5 years and has what we politely call ""food issues"" which means he cannot self regulate. To prevent the dreaded scarf-n-barf, he gets 4 meals a day, 2 dry and 2 wet. I bought a second carousel (the grey part the food goes in) and two ice packs, and every evening before I go to bed, I fill two sections with his breakfast and tea for the next day, and put it in the feeder with just a treat in the open bowl, and the ice pack underneath to keep it cool. Then the prior ice pack goes in the freezer, and I wash the dirty carousel, so everything is ready for the next evening.This system has made it so the cat\'s food focused ire isn\'t directed at me, and there are no more 5am demands for an early breakfast. It is up to the feeder gods. Every few months the carousel comes out of alignment (I\'m pretty sure from the cat attempting to push it) but that is easily corrected. It doesn\'t have a million buttons or internet connectivity or a camera, which are pros in my book, but ymmv. I set this up in December 2022, and am still on the first set of batteries. It\'s clock runs about 5 minutes slow at the moment, but since I\'ll reset it at the time change, that doesn\'t both us at all.My only complaint is that my cat is a bit of a messy eater. He gets food on the sides of the bowl and cover on a regular basis, and it can end up smeared inside the cover (I\'m not even sure how, and I assume most people\'s cats aren\'t quite so ill mannered) and it can be a bit of a to-do to clean. It was also a disaster the one time we had ants. But to me, this is more of a user error, and as long as himself lacks table manners, we would have this issue with any feeder.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 21, 2024', 'is_verified': True}]"

For some reason it didn't show up initially. There is no outside edge around the bowl. It is sloped downward to direct the food toward the center of the bowl, but my cat pushed the food up the slope & off of the side of the bowl. Big mess. I'm not sure why it didn't happen at first, but the problem didn't start until several weeks later.I really loved these bowls. They're cleverly made with protruding fishes that act to slow a cat's eating as they work to get the food from between them. This is one of the few bowls I saw formulated just for cats & there are many positives to the way it's made. The fish are a big deal at slowing the rate of eating. I also think that because the bowl is made of hard material, it was easier for my cat to eat, by using the hard surface of the fish to get a good grip on the piece of food she was trying to eat. She pushed the food up against the fish, where it was stopped by the hard surface, allowing her to then get it in her mouth.But that ended up being the reason for the problem too. She pushed the food around the bowl, and partially because the surface was hard & slippery, the food that didn't get wedged up against a fish, eventually got pushed right off of the bowl. I was sad when I had to pack up all of the bowls I'd bought & return them because I also thought they were pretty cute. But the long time went on, the worse the pushing of food from the bowl got to be, so they weren't helpful anymore. If the manufacturers would put a raised edge around the outside edge of the bowl, that would prevent food from getting pushed off of it. I liked these so much...until I didn't. In spite of my experience, I'd still recommend others give them a try. Your pet may not do what my cat did & they may be a perfect success story for you. To the manufacturers I'd recommend that you consider putting an edge around the bowl. Even if someone else's cat doesn't push the food off of the bowl, it would be a preventative measure so that it couldn't happen.

Smaller portion size for cats!!!', 'author': 'PorcupineMom', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'The media could not be loaded. Our biggest complaint about automatic pet feeders in the past is that the portion sizes are too big. With our older cat having a sensitive stomach, this has led to a lot of overeating and vomiting. This feeder has SOLVED that problem for us. We took out our scale and weighed out the portions between our old feeder and the Roilpet feeder. The Roilpet feeder came in about 2 grams less per serving! Yay! (And yes, our old boy has noticed.) As the video will tell you, we generally love everything about this feeder. When you initially set it up, do it closer to your router, but after that you can move it to a different location and it works perfectly. We love the fact that we control all of the settings from our phone. One of our biggest frustrations in the past was learning the button combinations to program other feeders. No more! This one is so easy! Our only feedback is we wish it had the capability to record video automatically every time they come to the feeder (you can manually record), but it does have a great feature where it will notify you on your phone when it senses motion at the feeder.

It was significantly more noticeable when larger portions were dispensed at once.Another design flaw is the part that attaches to the spout of the dispenser also causes kibble crumbs to fall into the crevices. Unlike their single bowl attachment which sits completely under the spout, this one does not. So for the single bowl attachment, all the kibble falls into the bowl including the crumbs. For the double bowl attachment, the crumbs constantly build up in the crevices because the bowls do not sit under the spout but rather in front of it.I feel these issues could easily be modified and improved. With the divider, I feel if it was a bit longer and had more flexibility to move more to the right, it could solve the issue with unequal portions. In addition to having us choose whether the right or left bowl gets more food as well. I'm not sure why they designed it in such a limited way.

Gonzalez', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""The media could not be loaded. So after looking at tons of different feeders on amazon and extensively reading reviews we decided on this one, here's my long but detailed review with all the information i would've liked to find when I was searching for one. (if you already have one and can't figure out how to program it skip to the bottom)All in all its great for the price and so far so good, two months in and its doing its job.Upsides:We like that the lid locks perfectly smooth with the rest of the feeder, no way for the cats to unlock it, lift it, or take it off even if they managed to trip the whole thing, if youre trying to manage/limit the amount of food your cat has access to, I recommend itIt doesn't make an awful sound like other feeders that have scared me to death when they turn on, just a little whirring noise and the kibble hitting the metal dish isnt bad at allDoesn't make any mess, all the food stays inside the dishPerfect size, not huge or bothersome at all, doesn't take too much spaceHolds 13 cups, each cup is 105gr so it totals to 1.36 kgsI tested the feeding ratio with a scale time and time again to have peace of mind before we left for a few days and it does vary 1 or 1.5 grams per portion sometimes but it has a pretty consistent 6.4 grams average per portion, and all the feedings were delivered exactly on timeCats like it, they were wary at first but figured it out by the end of the day and they now love it. We used an empty cardboard box on the bottom to raise it a little bit since we couldn't find a raised automatic feeder that we liked and it works, they haven't thrown it down even once.You can put batteries in so it keeps working in case of an energy outage, we haven't put any batteries in yet but it works fine, we actually had an outage for a couple of seconds and I was happily surprised to find out it was still programmed as usualThe dish comes out easily if you need to wash it. It hasn't become discolored or anything.Downsides:Other comments say it might not be as easy to unlock the lid if you have super long nails or arthritis, I usually keep mine long and manage just fine.It would be nice if the inside could be disassembled to clean, but not quite , you can take the top part off (above the orange line) but not the mechanical part and the feeding tube.My only complaint is that if the food doesn't get completely eaten, it stacks up in a little mountain in front of the feeding tube, it doesn't get pushed to the rest of the dish, so even if there's always food available for my cat (which gives me peace of mind if we ever have to leave for a trip) I can't be sure how much she is really eating on the regular day to dayThat said...Package arrived on time and in perfect condition, it was pretty easy breezy setting it up, as for the comments complaining its hard to program, I disagreeFirst measure how much food you want it to deliver per day and divide the grams between how many times a day you want your cat to be fed. If your cat eats one cup (105gr) of kibble and you want it to dispense food say four times during the day, that comes to 4 portions (approx 25 gr) each time in our case.Click the left button for a few seconds to unlock the digital pad and it'll let you begin programming, applies too if you want to reset/reprogram your settings, the light will turn on and you'll see the lock image disappear, next click the right button for a few seconds until you see the number for setting the hour begins flashing, use the middle (- +) button to adjust, when done click the right button to continue and set the minutes on the clock, click right button to continue, continue to adjust the time you want the first feeding and the amount of portions for it, next the second and so on, if you don't want all six feedings you can just select zero portions for the ones left, don't take too long between clicking buttons or it'll lock itself and you'll have to start from the beginning of the cycle and circle through to were you left off.the button on the top for feeding one portion at a time works perfectly well too, you just have to unlock the pad first...

I’m not using the bowl that came with it for several reasons. First, it’s too small for my big dog and second, neither I nor my dogs like the sound of the metal. Luckily, the bowl is detachable and an 8 inch ceramic pasta bowl fit under the shoot just fine. The portions are tiny and limited to 16 portions per feeding. With the dog food size I use, 6 portions is about 1/4 cup. There are six programmable time-slots, so feeding my large dog four times a day, she needs to eat 24 portions twice a day (which takes up four slots), and 16 portions twice (last two slots) to equal the 3.5 cups she needs every day. For example, in order to get 24 portions in a single feeding, I set the timer for 2:00 to serve the maximum 16 portions and for 2:01 to serve the additional eight portions. There was quite a lot of math setting this up and unfortunately because dog and cat food sizes differ, you will have to do your own math. I suggest that you allow the machine to dispense one portion and work out how much that is and go from there. One of my little ones is overweight and ruining free feeding for everyone, I’m hoping that this helps him.

There is no brand or model of these made truly for outdoor use that I could find, and I looked everywhere for quite a long time, but this one has the cleverest lid attachment latches I saw and an actual lid seal against ants, so I bought it. Most lid designs are to thwart a cat. I need to thwart raccoons.When I got it, I found that the lid attaches and seals very firmly as they had boasted, and you need two fingers to get it open. See the photo of the mud from raccoon paw prints as they tried unsuccessfully to get it open, so I was happy there. But then to my surprise, the food tank attaches very flimsily to the base with two side spring flip levers that a coon could easily figure out to break it open. So, as seen in photo #2, I drilled a small hole in the front and back and used two very short (about 3/8"" long) sheet metal screws to firmly attach it. That works great so far.You can also see in photo #2 that I used a bungee cord to firmly attach it to the leg of a metal outdoor chair so the coons could not bash it off the porch and bat it around trying to open it. Coons are very strong!It remains to be seen if the tiny fire ants we have here will be able to get between the seam of the tank and the base to get at the food, or enter the distribution area to enter the tank. It has been too cold for them so far. I can seal the tank seam with silicone, but if they can get in through the impeller, not much can be done.What I wish for: 1.) A truly outdoor, sealed auto feeder (and I have ideas!). 2.) A feed tank that attaches to the base with an ant-proof gasket by screws. It would be easy and inexpensive to engineer threaded brass inserts and thumbscrews or better yet, knurled screws, so it would still come apart easily for cleaning. 3.) Some molded brackets, so there is a better spot to hook bungee cords and be sure they can\'t slide off. The slight lip between tank and base does a pretty good job, though. 3.) A more ant-proof tray design, though this one does a lot better than a plain bowl of food did.The cat learned it right away. We\'ll see how well it stands up longer term. But so far it seems to be working well with the modifications.UPDATE 12/16/23: The raccoons finally got into the lid. Cannot find it anywhere, lol. Now trying to find out how to contact the company to see if I can get another lid. I guess more mods are still ahead for me.

The first time I set it up (on not a so strong 2.4 ghz WiFi) it spun and spun. I finally hit the back button and it showed that it was already connected. So there’s some glitch there (but it DID connect). Additionally, when I connected it to the 5ghz network it didn’t do that. So who knows. Just watch for it when you’re trying to add it and if it seems like it won’t pair.This would have been our second feeder so I’m familiar with the concept. It has a sound bite that’s about 20x the volume of our previous one. I actually had to turn it off because it scared me and the cats (and would have woken us up to my shrill “kitty… come here kitty …. Time to eat…. Smooch smooch smooch”. 😖)Also, it was a little wobbly and felt cheaply made. I wound up trying it with none of the legs though as my cats like to plop like loaves on the floor when they eat. The lid just felt like thin plastic compared to the lid I was used to with my other dispenser.Ultimately what did it in was the design of dispensation. We use freeze dried chicken that I cut up and it wasn’t steep enough for the chicken to actually come out of the shoot. I tried it with actual kibble (which my cats wouldn’t eat- they don’t like kibble) and it worked like a charm. But with the lighter, oddly shaped freeze dried chicken bits, it just wasn’t a match. (I know it CAN work from the previous dispenser which is finally getting old after 3 years).I think if you use kibble, you don’t work from home (so you’re not being scared by your voice and you think your cat will enjoy it), and you have carpet or a way to help with the potential wobble of the legs, this could be a really great dispenser. It has great camera quality, you can choose to set up notifications when there’s movement in front of it, there’s two way audio on it, and you can remotely dispense treats from it.

Right now as my husband attempts to program it using our own miserable batteries (very unhappy not having the adaptor included and the last one was chewed partly through by mice) he is cursing it.

We had a vacation planned for the week of Christmas, so we decided to get an automatic feeder. We actually got two because I was worried that someone might get pushed away & not be able to eat as much. So, we got this feeder along with one from another brand. Due to a wildlife problem in our barn, we decided to bring the feeders up to our deck, since the cats like to hang out up here, anyway. This one seems to be working very well.The main food compartment has a lid that locks in place, so you have to have human sized hands to open it. You do have to download an app on your phone or tablet in order to work it. You can set as many feedings as you want (I have ours set to drop food every 4 hours during the day). You can also set how many portions you want to drop at each feeding. There is a camera, so you can see your cats when they are at the feeder & take pictures or record a video. There is also a microphone feature on the app, so you can talk to them through the feeder. I\'ve tried it a few times & they come running when I call.Overall, I think this feeder works great. It does send me notifications on my phone rather often to tell me that the ""bucket is empty,"" which I think just means that there is no food in the bowl, which is fine.

Should've gotten this years ago!"", 'author': 'Amazon Customer', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""Cannot rate highly enough what you get ESPECIALLY for the price. I've had this for over a month now and it's the BEST investment I've made for my cat!I decided to get an auto feeder for my fuzzy friend after running into issues with her vomiting due to hairballs. I switched her to a different food and went to portion feeding instead of free-feeding which, in combo with regular brushing, did the trick! Saving my carpets and my poor cat from the discomfort. Now I didn't mind feeding her myself but I found when I traveled for a weekend or something, I didn't have that ability, just had to leave her a giant bowl of food. So I figured it was time to invest in something like this. Shortly after getting it, my work actually started having me travel more so it ended up working out perfectly.Here's why I give this 10/5 stars:- Simple setup. Has an app, which works great, and was super easy to get everything connected to my Wi-Fi.- The food storage compartment is HUGE, large enough to feed my one cat for over a month, so even if you have a few cats, this will keep them covered for awhile. It's also secured with a latch at the top so if you have some clever, trouble-making felines, they can't just pop the lid off to get inside.- On-demand feeding and/or setting schedule. There's many different portions size options and you can schedule it as often as you like. Even if you don't want it daily, you can set it to release x portions like M, W, F, Su, for example. There's also a button to drop however many portions right away, without having to do anything with the schedule.- The camera is EXCELLENT. It's incredibly good quality. You can take photos and record videos from it if you like.- The camera has NIGHT-VISION! Which is also EXCELLENT quality. This was a bonus I didn't expect to like as much as I did. I especially like it for when I'm gone because I can check it whatever time of day, whether my lights are on or not (they are set to timers as well when I'm gone).- Microphone is a cool bonus. Two-way mix. I can hear what's going on and even talk to my cat if I want. Personally, I felt bad talking to her because it seemed to just confuse her but it's still a really cool feature.- Connection while you're gone is EXCELLENT. Long as you have phone service or internet, you can use the app from anywhere in the world to check on your furry friends. It takes seconds for the video to load and I've never had an issue with it failing or not loading for some reason. This is a double whammy for me because not only can I check on my cat and see her when I'm gone but with where I have the feeder in my apartment, you can see most of the main area. So it effectively acts as kinda a security cam as well. Granted it's not constantly recording but I can see check on my place to see what's going on anytime, day or night, light or dark, anywhere in the world.- Has both battery power (D) and plug-in. I use both. It's great knowing if there's a power outage, the batteries will keep it going, but I don't have to rely on JUST those and worry if they go dead.I rate products every so often on Amazon and while I've had many great experiences, this is probably the most satisfied I've been with any product I've purchased with regards to price vs value.

But the batteries can also just function as a backup power supply in the event that you have a power outage, which I guess is a good idea to have, just in case, and that wouldn’t run thru those expensive batteries very fast.The one thing I do find really strange and a bit annoying is the way you set the amount of food to dispense is through “portions”, but one portion is like 6-10 individual pieces of food… it doesn’t seem accurate that one portion is 1/8 of a cup like it says.

Despite being marketed as a cat feeder, I seamlessly adapted it to suit my dog's feeding schedule. Managing two meals a day, each dispensing a precise 2 cups of kibble, has never been easier.What truly sets this feeder apart is the ability to record my own voice for feeding reminders. It's like a personal touch, even when I'm not around. This feeder allows you to record a personal message, and it will be played right before the meal is dispensed. It’s an adorable and personal touch. The initial setup was a breeze, thanks to straightforward instructions. However, disassembly for cleaning, which I undertake weekly (sometimes twice), is a tad more intricate.The packaging impressed me – a box within a box ensured a secure delivery. Powering this feeder with three D alkaline batteries grants an impressive 180-day battery life. This makes feedings so much easier at my house. I just have to clean the batteries up to date, keep dog food around, and the machine clean.The scheduled meal feature has eradicated issues like overeating, vomiting, and esophagitis. I appreciate the thoughtful design, including a built-in desiccant box in the BPA-free tank that keeps the kibble fresh and crunchy. The stainless steel bowl is dishwasher-safe, and very hygienic eating space for my pup. Equipped with a torque motor, this feeder eliminates concerns about food jams and missed feedings. I only use this feeder with dry kibbles or freeze-dried food. This wireless automatic pet feeder has exceeded my expectations, providing a reliable, convenient, and safe solution to streamline my dog's mealtime routine.

The programming of it is moderately easy too.

In my situation the flexibility of being able to place the feeder “anywhere” won outtraining the cat: Since kitty currently gets a mixture of wet and dry catfood, i had to come up with a training plan to teach her to eat all dry (since the machine cannot handle wet, canned catfood.) I decided to mix kitty’s current dry kibble with small tuna-flavored treats that are equally dry but - according to kitty - are irresistible. That mixture got kitty to eat timidly out of the stainless steel bowl whenever the machine dispensed some food. kitty was quick to figure out what the sound of the food being dispensed was - no issues there. But she seemed spooked by the mirror-like stainless steel bowl. (Kitty was feral till she became an indoor cat some nine years ago. so she still retains some of those feral ways that kept her alive back then.) So - bottom line - it will likely take weeks for kitty to totally adapt to the new process but that’s OK. Your kitty might find it far easier to become acclimated to new things.i plan to use this automatic feeder as kitty’s only source of food till she is 100% comfortable with it. At that point i will feel confident that i can depend on it for the next trip out of town.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 4, 2023', 'is_verified': False}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars kittens enjoy the dispenser!', 'author': 'xingou', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""this automatic food dispenser is great!

Like clockwork, at 5:00 am, 5:00 pm, and 10:30 pm, Squeakie must be fed, or else! The iPettie automatic cat (or small dog) food dispenser is the perfect solution to our problems and has finally given us independence from our cat's craving's.This food dispenser allows you to program from one to four feedings a day at any time specified, with portion sizes ranging from 1/8 cup up to 1 1/4 cups, in eighth-cup intervals. This allows us to give our cat a larger meal portion in the morning, and smaller portions later on.This product seems to be well designed and manufactured and works quite well, so far. One negative, was that our cat was quickly able to find a way to disengage the plastic bowl holder and bowl from the disperser, and one of his early meals went on to the floor. He ate it anyway. We were able to find an easy workaround by placing the feeder on a small tray with a slight rim.If your cat is driving you crazy with his or her food cravings then an automatic food dispenser might be exactly what you need.

This is particularly useful for those who don't want the hassle of frequent battery changes.Voice Recording: The voice recording feature allows you to call your cat when it's mealtime, adding a personal touch that many pets will find comforting.Quality Materials: The stainless steel bowl and food-grade BPA-free tank ensure that your cat's food stays fresh and free from harmful chemicals.Ease of Use: The interface is user-friendly, making it easy to set up feeding schedules. The 3L/12 cup capacity is also a plus, reducing the frequency of refills.Flaws:Wireless Issues: While the product is advertised as wireless, it's worth noting that the wireless functionality is somewhat limited. It doesn't connect to a mobile app, which some might find inconvenient for remote adjustments.Price Point: The iPettie Hourglass is on the higher end of the price spectrum for automatic cat feeders. While its features justify the cost to an extent, budget-conscious buyers may hesitate.Noise Level: The mechanism that dispenses the food is a bit noisy, which could be startling for more skittish cats.In summary, the iPettie Hourglass Automatic Cat Food Dispenser offers a robust set of features that will satisfy most needs. Its long battery life and quality materials make it a reliable choice, although it does come with a few minor drawbacks.

That last point isn't really important to me, but it may be important to others.I'll note that we managed to spill liquid on and destroy the manual, so we had to figure stuff like programming and portion sizes out without instructions, and it was doable if a little complicated.One other thing worth noting is that it seems to dispense much more consistent amounts at higher portion sizes than smaller ones, but I expect some of that is due to the shape of the hopper feeder and the size and shape of the kibble itself. For example, on the smallest portion size it will dispense anywhere from about 10-20 kibbles at once.

The batteries needed are D size (some reviews say AA or C).The recording announces my call twice very clearly and loudly and sounds like me perfectly. The cats came immediately, they were a bit skittish at first but ate out of the dish, and a month in, are now used to this and come running as soon as they hear it.We have used the ""manual"" feed option a few times and it will play my recording and dispense 1 portion.The locking top seems secure however, when moving the dispenser a few pieces of food came out (I\'ve noticed if you tilt it FORWARD, that\'s when the food falls out), so as long as the cats don\'t tip this or move this somehow, we should be good. My Siberian kitty is extremely intelligent and has tried to put her paw where the food is dispensed to get more, but so far she hasn\'t been successful.Cons:1. I wish there was an ability/option to dispense a half portion.2. I wish it was a stainless steel container that holds the food as I\'m not a fan of plastic storage for food.3. There is no way to turn off the flashing blue light, which sometimes attracts the cats curiosity when it isn\'t feeding time.4.

This is one of my favourites. One thing I like is that it is melamine instead of plastic, so there\'s less worry about that vile ""amazon stink"" clinging to it and germs growing in microscopic scratches (plastic is notoriously a cause of feline acne, which you do not want to get! Whatever material your slow feeders are, be sure to clean them regularly). Another thing I love is the elevation, as two of the cats are getting old and I prefer they not have to crouch down with their arthritic old spines and hips. Actually the baby is a puker so I think it is great for her too, to eat with her mouth somewhat level with her stomach rather than leaning down. Third great thing is that rim around the base. Sure a couple crunchies escape each day but compared to all our other puzzles, which scatter a couple dozen crunchies a day each, this is very tidy! Another very important plus is that the cats actually started to use it almost right away. Some of the more elaborate puzzles they never would use after months, or only a few of the cats would use it and it took weeks to get them to try. Also I like that it comes in some bland colours. Most slow feeders are made in such loud colours so they may spoil the look of your room. Last detail I love is that it\'s so petite. Some of them are so big it is a pain to wash them, they don\'t even fit in a standard sink.Downsides are nothing major. The bumps stick up higher than the edge of the food dish so you can\'t submerge them by filling it with boiling water to sanitize the dish. But oh well, I just pour the water over and it seems to get it clean enough (so far no acne). I think they may be a bit annoying to the cats because of how high they are. But that\'s kinda the point. If it was easy to eat out of it would be useless. I had thought shark fins would have been cute but now that I see it in action I realise it\'s necessary the bumps be rounded so nobody loses an eye LOL. Another downside is that the rubber feet fall off easily. I intend to glue them in someday soon before they end up missing or worse, eaten. Be sure to use a non stinky glue so you don\'t put the pet off their food. I like the feet in general though because after washing you can put it down before it is perfectly dry, without worry that there\'ll be water trapped beneath. The feet elevate it just a hair so there\'s a little airflow underneath. They also keep it from clattering if the pet bumps the dish while they eat.

Maybe he's just an Olympic champion of eating but he scarfs his food just as fast with or without this bowl.

My suggestion for this product: Use it for 2 separate days where your cat wants wet food. Use ANOTHER automatic feeder for their dry food to get you buy. If your cat ONLY eats dry food, there are better automatic feeders out there for pet needs which can cover up to 10 days.

She\'s a former stray and tends to scarf down her food so fast that she then barfs it back up. I\'d been told a puzzle feeder was a good solution. So, maybe my cat is a genius, but it only took her a moment to figure out how the egg works. Now she gets all excited every time I pick up the egg because she knows what\'s coming.For my purposes, this thing seems sturdy and durable but I can see that there could possibly be issues with breakage in situations where a cat might be very rambunctious, such as if it was likely to get rolled down a flight of hardwood stairs or knocked off a table. It\'s made of a hard plastic that feels like it could be a bit brittle. But all that\'s happening is that it\'s rolling around on the floor, this egg seems durable enough. Filling it, ""dialing"" the hole sizes and cleaning it are all very easy.My only real complaint is not entirely the fault of the product. I wish there was a little more precision in controlling the size of the holes. It happens that the food I feed my cat is too big to exit the holes easily on one setting. My little instant gratification princess gets annoyed and walks away if she\'s not rewarded pretty quickly. She left it sitting with treats for 2 full days because she was not going to give it the satisfaction of rolling it a million times to get out one piece of goodness. But if I adjust the hole size by just one click, the hole is so large that a bunch of pieces fall out all at once and the egg is empty within seconds, thereby defeating the whole ""slow down the eating"" thing I was trying to accomplish.

One is a glutton and the other is a puker.The glutton got really overweight and was unable to clean herself properly. I had to give her bathes to help her. The person I live with would feed her every time she meowed at them begging for food even though she was not starved and it was terrible for her. Before this I tried using a scheduled portion controlled automatic feeder for my cats to get them to stop begging people and told people to not feed them at all anymore. Sadly people continued feeding them so it really did not work out and that was a lot of money down the drain for me. Very frustrating!The puker would eat too fast and later throw up some food. Not often but it happened more than I want it to because I don't want it to happen AT ALL.As a result of this toy...My glutton has lost enough weight in one months time to be able to clean herself. Yay! She must have lost 1lb at least!? I didn't weigh her so I don't know but you can visibly see it regardless. I did supplement this with playing with her more as well so probably not all credit goes to the toy but it has definitely LARGELY contributed.My puker no longer throws up! Double yay!Some people just simply do not understand how this toy works so if you're considering it, please don't be discouraged by the people who think it doesn't work. Let me just clarify something... If you twist the settings at the top so that each hole is less than about a quarter inch open.... Your cat will have to work for it. The food does not just fall out. However, if you completely open one hole on the thing then obviously food is just going to fall out... It shouldn't be hard to figure out but for some, it is. My cat gets at most 3-4 kibbles to drop out of it in a single bat. That's being generous. Normally it's just 1-2. The kibble I feed my cats are very small as well. So they really have to keep batting the toy to get a full meal which is better than just scarfing it down out of a bowl which is effortless and requires no energy at all and contributes to eating too fast and/or gaining weight. And because it takes time for them to get a meals worth, they eat slower which is healthier for a puker. Because it requires work, THEY STOP either because it's empty or because they are no longer hungry enough to keep playing with it! This is good. Especially for a beggar. They can simply come back to the toy later when they're hungry enough to play with it again and work their food out. My cat took some time to get used to the new system but now she doesn't beg me for food unless the toy is empty so it really does help throughout the day if she isn't pestering me or people I live with for food because she ate it all at once. It's also very very easy to wash and clean! I don't think I'd trust it in the dishwasher even on the top rack... I'd suggest giving it a good scrub with soap and water by hand and letting it air dry.Literally the only con to this toy... I should have gotten 2. That way I only have to fill each one up once a day and each cat would have their own. My cats did develop some behavioral issues towards each other because they were forced to share. My puker is part feral and has always had attitude. She has attacked my glutton in frustration. Nothing damaging but enough to get the point across that she doesn't want to share lol.

So I tried the NiMH AA cells we use for just about everything else in D size adapters. It powered up briefly, but quickly shut down. I suspected the voltage was too low from either type of rechargeable batteries, so I tried AA alkaline cells in the D adapters. Still no go, so I’ll have to pick up some real D cells. But since we rarely have a power outage, and even then it only lasts an hour or so, we probably don’t need battery backup anyway.I downloaded the Android app, and went through the registration process.

I'm Shocked How Good It Is!"", 'author': 'Ryan A. Leemhuis', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'A little background first. We had previously used the Crown Majestic feeder for our cat. It worked fairly well although it was a bit ugly, would occasionally jam and the portion sizes were very hit and miss. We used it until its power connection internally broke and it would only run off batteries which was difficult to keep up with.So that led me on my search for a replacement. There are a lot more options now than there used to be. My main features I was looking for were wifi control and reliability.I found it difficult to narrow down my choice as I found varying reviews and some claimed that a model was terrible and some said it was amazing. I eventually settled on the Petkit mini feeder from a cost and design perspective. First of all, it looks great. I love the thought that went into the design from the magnetically attached bowl to the jumper that allows the DC adapter to easily disconnect from the wall should you need. I was a little nervous about how much food could be stored but upon seeing the compartment this is a good amount for a cat. I find we need to fill it once every 2 weeks or so.That brings us to the worst part of the product. Lets just be clear here...the app is decent...but there are some language oddities and the setup did not go according to design. I am a techy and I initially tried pairing the feeder with my phone. It got fairly far into the setup but kept failing out during the wifi pairing process. I then tried my wife\'s phone and it did the same. I then happened to notice that the feeder was already showing on the app\'s dashboard and sure enough it had been paired even though the app claimed it had failed. I don\'t know why this occurred but be prepared for some setup issues.Once setup, however, the app is great. The food portion sizes are accurate and on demand feeds occur nearly immediately. The schedule is easy to setup and food is distributed on time. We use prescription ""disc-shaped"" food and other feeders claimed they weren\'t compatible. We have had ZERO issues with this machine getting jammed or having any issue with our food. It is actually very fun to watch the little door open on the machine and then the food dump out.For the cost, this feeder is a steal. It is so much better than our previous feeder it makes me wonder why I didn\'t upgrade earlier. My only suggestions for improvement would be to further improve the app and instructions translations. There are some real English oddities (which you can see in the product\'s amazon page as well. In addition, the setup process obviously needs some improvement too as it failed twice for me and some how magically appeared on my apps dashboard after this fail. Other than that, the feeder is perfect. It feels very high quality and the mechanics seem sound.

It looks like it belongs in an art museum.The PetKit Mini feeder is the ideal automatic feeder for my needs. What I like best is that it precisely delivers very small meals (as little as 1/20 of a cup or 5 grams) to my overweight cat up to 10 times per day. In my case I had been feeding my cat 20 grams of cat kibbles twice per day... or 40 grams. My cat was waking me up at 4 AM begging for more food. The PetKit Mini stopped the begging behavior! With the PetKit Mini I was able to schedule 8 feedings of 5 grams each... for a total of 40 grams per day... but spread out over the course of the day and night. This way my cat gets precisely fed her reduced ration and eliminates my tendency to give her a little extra when she begs.The PetKit Mini has improved my cat's relationship with me. She no longer relies on me for food. With the PetKit Mini she visits me often and regularly because she wants my company... not because she wants food. And it has improved my relationship with my cat since I am no longer irritated by her pestering behaviors at 4 AM when she gets hungry.The engineers who designed the PetKit Mini payed very close attention to critical details that separate this feeder from the pack. I studied them all before I made my purchase decision. The silicone rubber paddles that meter the kibbles into the rotary dosing cups are designed to flex so the kibbles don’t jam in the mechanism.The engineers used silicone rubber gaskets to seal out moisture at the feeding door and food reservoir lid. Then they provide a replaceable desiccant pack (those little packs that you often find in a box of new shoes) that absorb any moisture that might otherwise accumulate in your dried food. You can imagine that if your kibbles absorbed moisture from the air and swelled up like a sponge that they wouldn’t feed well in the mechanism. It also keeps the food fresher and prevents mold growth I would think.I found the PetKit Mini was easy to set up. It did help that I had an $8 electronic scale so I could better measure in grams how much I had been feeding my cat. I had been using a very small measuring cup. It was a lot easier to weigh the kibbles than to try to measure the volume of food.I measured the amount of food the PetKit Mini delivered with each feeding. I did this 8 times just to see how repeatable the feedings were. With my dry kibbles the average amount of each feeding was 4.97 grams. Pretty good if you were targeting 5 grams! (The standard deviation was 0.31 grams… who remembers what a standard deviation is???)Since I am only feeding my cat 40 grams per day the food reservoir is large enough for storing a 37 day supply. I can just check the food level once per month to be safe… but the PetKit Mini is designed with a monitor that will alert me when the food is low. What a great feature! It will also remind me every 30 days to replace the desiccant pack. I found some after-market desiccant packs on EBay that will fit the PetKit Mini because I couldn’t find any OEM packs online.This is a great automatic WiFI cat feeder! I liked it so much I bought a second PetKit Mini for my daughter for Christmas. She too has an overweight cat (though not for long).

Unboxing and putting everything together is easy, and so far the feeder has been reliable. That said, I think the app is a lot more complex than it needs to be, and while that can be updated and changed over time, it's important to know what you're getting into.When you go through setup of the feeder and app for the first time, I think the experience is a bit all over the place. There are instruction stickers on the feeder itself, there is a booklet of instructions, there are QR codes and links within the booklet to scan to get to videos that you have to watch for further steps, and then there's setup within the app itself... etc. I think it's just a few too many layers of info and could be pared down significantly. Once everything is setup and you're trying to actually use the app, those same issues of unnecessary layers/ complications continue. The app tries to get you to schedule meals based on feeding recommendations for your pet, so you have to setup a profile for each of your pets first. This sounds minor, but it's quite detailed, and includes a whole lot of information that isn't truly necessary just to make a recommendation for feeding quantity. In the end, a truly informed recommendation would really require nutrition information about your pet food itself, so the whole exercise is a bit silly. I was left feeling a bit unsure of how much of this information I *really* needed or wanted to complete. Once you have been asked about various details for your pet, then you need to schedule fixed meals for each, and again I do appreciate that they tried to include a lot of options for customization, but it's just too much. For one, how do they propose that you make sure the right pet eats the right meal, etc? I think it would be much easier to remove those options, or hide them behind an advanced mode, and just let you set a very simple schedule with set times and quantities. K.I.S.S. you know? Given that the app doesn't interface with bluetooth trackers or smart catboxes or anything like that, I'm not sure I see any need for the pet profiles at all! It just adds complexity for no discernible reason.Beyond the actual cumbersome data entry requirements, I found the interface to be not very intuitive. I had difficulty finding the settings that I actually wanted to look for and find out more about, such as the Alexa integration, and kept getting lost in layers of social media integrations and gamification... which, why? I was looking into trying out the Smart Home integration options, but do I need a community and messaging platform for my smart feeder? Maybe this is more of a cultural thing, I believe the company is based in China, but I just don't need this kind of fluff cluttering up the basic functions of the app. I'd really enjoy it more if they could pull back on these added features, or again, maybe just hide them all in one area of the app called 'Social' or similar, but they seemed to be behind every corner. For me, again it just took away from the experience of feeling like I could find the basic information and functions quickly and easily. Thankfully, apps can be can be improved and refined over time, so I feel that most of those concerns are somewhat secondary. If you plan to use it in a way where you can sit down and get through it, then basically 'set it and forget it', I think it will work well for you. But if you would plan to regularly make any tweaks to your meal plans, I think it would be a not-minor annoyance. I'll also mention that this is something my partner and I considered setting up for aging parents, just as a little convenience item to make their lives easier. After working with it, I don't know if I can comfortably go that direction.

I'm Shocked How Good It Is!"", 'author': 'Ryan A. Leemhuis', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'A little background first. We had previously used the Crown Majestic feeder for our cat. It worked fairly well although it was a bit ugly, would occasionally jam and the portion sizes were very hit and miss. We used it until its power connection internally broke and it would only run off batteries which was difficult to keep up with.So that led me on my search for a replacement. There are a lot more options now than there used to be. My main features I was looking for were wifi control and reliability.I found it difficult to narrow down my choice as I found varying reviews and some claimed that a model was terrible and some said it was amazing. I eventually settled on the Petkit mini feeder from a cost and design perspective. First of all, it looks great. I love the thought that went into the design from the magnetically attached bowl to the jumper that allows the DC adapter to easily disconnect from the wall should you need. I was a little nervous about how much food could be stored but upon seeing the compartment this is a good amount for a cat. I find we need to fill it once every 2 weeks or so.That brings us to the worst part of the product. Lets just be clear here...the app is decent...but there are some language oddities and the setup did not go according to design. I am a techy and I initially tried pairing the feeder with my phone. It got fairly far into the setup but kept failing out during the wifi pairing process. I then tried my wife\'s phone and it did the same. I then happened to notice that the feeder was already showing on the app\'s dashboard and sure enough it had been paired even though the app claimed it had failed. I don\'t know why this occurred but be prepared for some setup issues.Once setup, however, the app is great. The food portion sizes are accurate and on demand feeds occur nearly immediately. The schedule is easy to setup and food is distributed on time. We use prescription ""disc-shaped"" food and other feeders claimed they weren\'t compatible. We have had ZERO issues with this machine getting jammed or having any issue with our food. It is actually very fun to watch the little door open on the machine and then the food dump out.For the cost, this feeder is a steal. It is so much better than our previous feeder it makes me wonder why I didn\'t upgrade earlier. My only suggestions for improvement would be to further improve the app and instructions translations. There are some real English oddities (which you can see in the product\'s amazon page as well. In addition, the setup process obviously needs some improvement too as it failed twice for me and some how magically appeared on my apps dashboard after this fail. Other than that, the feeder is perfect. It feels very high quality and the mechanics seem sound. HIGHLY recommended.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 29, 2019', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars PetKit Mini - Small Pet Feeder - Review', 'author': 'AirplaneCatBlue', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""The PetKit Mini feeder is attractively and elegantly designed. It looks like it belongs in an art museum.The PetKit Mini feeder is the ideal automatic feeder for my needs. What I like best is that it precisely delivers very small meals (as little as 1/20 of a cup or 5 grams) to my overweight cat up to 10 times per day. In my case I had been feeding my cat 20 grams of cat kibbles twice per day... or 40 grams. My cat was waking me up at 4 AM begging for more food. The PetKit Mini stopped the begging behavior! With the PetKit Mini I was able to schedule 8 feedings of 5 grams each... for a total of 40 grams per day... but spread out over the course of the day and night. This way my cat gets precisely fed her reduced ration and eliminates my tendency to give her a little extra when she begs.The PetKit Mini has improved my cat's relationship with me. She no longer relies on me for food. With the PetKit Mini she visits me often and regularly because she wants my company... not because she wants food. And it has improved my relationship with my cat since I am no longer irritated by her pestering behaviors at 4 AM when she gets hungry.The engineers who designed the PetKit Mini payed very close attention to critical details that separate this feeder from the pack. I studied them all before I made my purchase decision. The silicone rubber paddles that meter the kibbles into the rotary dosing cups are designed to flex so the kibbles don’t jam in the mechanism.The engineers used silicone rubber gaskets to seal out moisture at the feeding door and food reservoir lid. Then they provide a replaceable desiccant pack (those little packs that you often find in a box of new shoes) that absorb any moisture that might otherwise accumulate in your dried food. You can imagine that if your kibbles absorbed moisture from the air and swelled up like a sponge that they wouldn’t feed well in the mechanism. It also keeps the food fresher and prevents mold growth I would think.I found the PetKit Mini was easy to set up. It did help that I had an $8 electronic scale so I could better measure in grams how much I had been feeding my cat. I had been using a very small measuring cup. It was a lot easier to weigh the kibbles than to try to measure the volume of food.I measured the amount of food the PetKit Mini delivered with each feeding. I did this 8 times just to see how repeatable the feedings were. With my dry kibbles the average amount of each feeding was 4.97 grams. Pretty good if you were targeting 5 grams! (The standard deviation was 0.31 grams… who remembers what a standard deviation is???)Since I am only feeding my cat 40 grams per day the food reservoir is large enough for storing a 37 day supply. I can just check the food level once per month to be safe… but the PetKit Mini is designed with a monitor that will alert me when the food is low. What a great feature! It will also remind me every 30 days to replace the desiccant pack. I found some after-market desiccant packs on EBay that will fit the PetKit Mini because I couldn’t find any OEM packs online.This is a great automatic WiFI cat feeder! I liked it so much I bought a second PetKit Mini for my daughter for Christmas. She too has an overweight cat (though not for long).

Unboxing and putting everything together is easy, and so far the feeder has been reliable. That said, I think the app is a lot more complex than it needs to be, and while that can be updated and changed over time, it's important to know what you're getting into.When you go through setup of the feeder and app for the first time, I think the experience is a bit all over the place. There are instruction stickers on the feeder itself, there is a booklet of instructions, there are QR codes and links within the booklet to scan to get to videos that you have to watch for further steps, and then there's setup within the app itself... etc. I think it's just a few too many layers of info and could be pared down significantly. Once everything is setup and you're trying to actually use the app, those same issues of unnecessary layers/ complications continue. The app tries to get you to schedule meals based on feeding recommendations for your pet, so you have to setup a profile for each of your pets first. This sounds minor, but it's quite detailed, and includes a whole lot of information that isn't truly necessary just to make a recommendation for feeding quantity. In the end, a truly informed recommendation would really require nutrition information about your pet food itself, so the whole exercise is a bit silly. I was left feeling a bit unsure of how much of this information I *really* needed or wanted to complete. Once you have been asked about various details for your pet, then you need to schedule fixed meals for each, and again I do appreciate that they tried to include a lot of options for customization, but it's just too much. For one, how do they propose that you make sure the right pet eats the right meal, etc? I think it would be much easier to remove those options, or hide them behind an advanced mode, and just let you set a very simple schedule with set times and quantities. K.I.S.S. you know? Given that the app doesn't interface with bluetooth trackers or smart catboxes or anything like that, I'm not sure I see any need for the pet profiles at all! It just adds complexity for no discernible reason.Beyond the actual cumbersome data entry requirements, I found the interface to be not very intuitive. I had difficulty finding the settings that I actually wanted to look for and find out more about, such as the Alexa integration, and kept getting lost in layers of social media integrations and gamification... which, why? I was looking into trying out the Smart Home integration options, but do I need a community and messaging platform for my smart feeder? Maybe this is more of a cultural thing, I believe the company is based in China, but I just don't need this kind of fluff cluttering up the basic functions of the app. I'd really enjoy it more if they could pull back on these added features, or again, maybe just hide them all in one area of the app called 'Social' or similar, but they seemed to be behind every corner. For me, again it just took away from the experience of feeling like I could find the basic information and functions quickly and easily. Thankfully, apps can be can be improved and refined over time, so I feel that most of those concerns are somewhat secondary. If you plan to use it in a way where you can sit down and get through it, then basically 'set it and forget it', I think it will work well for you. But if you would plan to regularly make any tweaks to your meal plans, I think it would be a not-minor annoyance. I'll also mention that this is something my partner and I considered setting up for aging parents, just as a little convenience item to make their lives easier. After working with it, I don't know if I can comfortably go that direction. I definitely don't feel confident that they would have gotten through any of the initial setup themselves, but I also don't think they could make any on-the-fly changes to the configuration even if the initial steps were done for them.

I previously owned a wopet feeder that ending up being too top heavy and my cat could knock it over or using her paw to turn the impeller that dispensed food.

It's a stockier feeder so it's hard to knock over. It's feed buttons are on the side and requires you to hold them to dispense food manually. Also the cat can't reach a impeller to vend food. It even has a dessicant (oxygen absorber) you can add to keep food fresh in the feeder. I ended up buying some replacements that you can heat up to reuse as a cost saving measure. This pet kit feeder includes a HD camera and a speaker and microphone if you want to talk to your cats or set recorded messages during feeding times. You can set detailed feeding times and has an easy way to stop a feeding in case you want to feed them wet food. The app can be somewhat buggy at times but never for more than a minute since it fixes itself. It will bother you about signing up for the petkit+ service to see video recordings and make vlogs to music of their activities in front of the camera.

The big issue was that the two units, even though they were the same exact model, kept time differently. One was fast, the other was slow, so over the course of a week, we would have a gulf of about 2 1/2 minutes which resulted in hurt feelings and competition. Cue the third cat and we tried a different brand. That one kept time a little better, but we were still struggling with clocks that would never be synchronized and it was a chore to always update 3 feeders every few days just to ensure the cats were fed at their respective stations at the same time and no one had an opportunity to eat theirs and steal another's in the time it took for food to be dispensed.I had my eye on this, as it's WiFi enabled, and we already have the automatic litter box, so we were familiar with the brand. I bought a couple to trial and they have worked wonders so far, the internet connectivity ensures they are dispensing at almost identical times, rather than relying on an onboard clock. So, we purchased a third, and will purchase a fourth and fifth once the kittens are a bit bigger.Setting up the feeding plan is a breeze and refilling couldn't be easier. I also like the shallow bowl because it does keep whisker fatigue to a minimum as they don't have to bury their heads too deep to reach their food.Set up was a breeze as well. It was very easy to connect as the device was easily recognized and firmware updates took moments without any failures. The app works great with virtually no delays in input - want to give them a little snack? Tap the snack button, select your serving size and it dispenses as soon as you make your choice.For the price and the features, it's a no brainer. There's simply no reason reason to pay more for less with competitors, at least those who are respectable names in this market, and not just a random brand that has popped up trying to offer a cheap alternative with a janky app.5/5 stars."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 28, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Super happy I risked this feeder!!', 'author': 'Amazon Customer', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'UPDATE**: still 5stars. Update is bc people are saying this has a bad wifi system. I set up a separate 2.4G network off my main 5G network, and it works perfectly fine. I get 2-3 wifi Bars on my phone from where the feeder is so I do have a good network connection. Only have about avg 700-800mbps wifi and a ton of other items in the home like security cameras and smart plugs with multiple roommates also tech heavy, so the issue is definitely not with the feeder (unless they got a defective one idk). I did have my power go out once but due to the battery backup the feeder still dispensed food on time and reconnected to the wifi when the power came back on without me having to do anything. Also read someone said the app didn’t work with an iPhone. I have a newer iPhone and the app was super easy, as if I was downloading any other app (Instagram, etc.). Updating bc I don’t want people to overlook this feeder bc of a few reviews that don’t always apply.So this feeder only had 8 reviews when I ordered it which is way low for my usual trust with a new brand. however, MY CATS LOVE THIS FEEDER. They weren’t intimidated by the size or layout. Very intuitive for my cats to use. Love that it’s also a plain clean look with the app (so far so good) and doesn’t have those tacky looking buttons on most automatic feeders. Extremely clean design which was a big factor in buying. The lid That seals is also nice. I picked up the feeder and turned it sideways just to see if it would spill, and it stayed secure with the latch they used.The installation was incredibly easy and straight forward. I expected it to be more intense. My cats use purina one kitten food mixed with purina one probiotic health adult food, and the dispenser has done very well with portion size mixed. Will update this if anything changes.The App really impressed me with how it logged my cats’ weights and age etc to help with portion control. I needed this bc I wasn’t sure how much to give my kitties after them being on an open bowl meal (but got too chunky hence the feeder & I am a student and not always home etc).Only Pros at this Point. I got the stainless steel option and highly recommend that bowl as opposed to the plastic. Your cat will appreciate it and it’s a lot easier to clean.The Green Color is exactly how the picture looks.

I\'ll update if it stops working or something. The app isn\'t super sleek and displays my feeding history partially in Chinese, but it\'s not too confusing either, and the feeder quickly connected to my iPhone on a 2.4G network. Set up was really easy, 2-3 minutes, and mostly I just use the ""extra feeding"" button, although the recommended meal plan seemed appropriate if all my cat ate was dry food, and was easy to edit. I like the green color and the stainless steel bowl.I\'ve only had it for a few weeks, with no problems. My cat is underweight, not food-motivated, usually eats raw or wet food, and was recently diagnosed with kidney issues and maybe isn\'t really supposed to be eating dry food anyway. However, he often refuses to eat his wet food, especially prescription food, before I leave for work. It\'s better for him to eat dry food than not eat at all, so I use this to send him small amounts food throughout the day and give me some peace of mind that if he wants to eat, he can (and that the food isn\'t super stale). I do wish the feeder could tell me if the cat has eaten any of the food in the bowl, and how much, instead of just logging how much has been dispensed. This way I could track his eating and avoid adding more food when he hasn\'t eaten... but maybe that\'s a lot to ask from a feeder? Anyway, having a remotely controlled feeder also means that if I find I\'m not going to be home for scheduled feeding times, it\'s not such a big deal, which is good because I live in a city with unpredictable traffic. I\'m pretty satisfied.Edit: I\'ve had the feeder for a while now to feed two cats on a schedule. It does have some bugs. The main issue is that it will double-dispense food randomly, some 10-20% of the time. I always receive a notification that it\'s working normally and has released the scheduled amount of food, but if I am home, I can see/hear that it dispenses, and then after about 30 seconds dispenses the same amount again, this time without sending any notification. This isn\'t as bad as if it were not dispensing any food at all, but it\'s a pain because one of my cats will happily overeat and get sick if I\'m not home to intervene. The only solution seems to be making meals even smaller so that when it double dispenses, it\'s not so much extra. I also somewhat frequently receive notifications that the feeder is jammed or low on food when it is not (maybe twice a month). The feeder has only actually jammed once.

I did not have to do a pet profile as some others reported. If I did, I would have stopped.Smallest portion is 1/10 cup. I usually feed her less as she gobbles and then throws it up, but I tried it.So I set up 4 feeds a day. This is tedious with scrolling wheels for times for each feeding.

Town', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I bought this for a colony of about a dozen feral cats (all but a couple TNR\'d) that live in the woods near my house. I set them up some beds and a big food bowl in a shed but raccoons and possums were stealing the food. (And I was tired if going out in the rain to fill the bowl.) So I got this feeder and set it up in the shed. So far, this has held up well. The raccoons and possums can only steal 1/2 cup at a time. The raccoons get pretty aggressive when the bowl is empty but they haven\'t managed to get the lid off the new feeder. I\'ve seen them tossing it around on the security camera but the feeder\'s held up fine. I eventually attached it to the floor of the shed.I haven\'t set up a schedule because feral cats are terrible at telling time. If it\'s empty when I check the security camera, I hit ""Extra feeding"" on my phone and dump 1/2 cup in the bowl. It took the cats about 2 days to figure out that the noise means food. Sometimes I\'ll see 3 or 4 of them sitting in a semi-circle around the bowl waiting for me to hit the button.I\'ve run several brands of cat food thru it (whatever\'s on sale in bulk) and it\'s pretty consistent with the portion despite the different sizes and shapes of the kibble. I\'ve never had it get stuck with food left in the hopper. It gets down to the last few pieces every time.It would be nice if it was easier to clean. You have to take out 4 screws to take the dispenser chamber off and really get in there with a brush to get the rotating part clean.

I’ve spent an incredible amount of time researching Cat Feeders ever since 2020 when PetNet (feeders) went out of business. They were the best in the industry, hands-down! and now I’m stuck with TWO of their $150 paper weights, essentially. I’ve searched far and wide for replacements. So on Amazon Prime Day, July 12, I pulled the trigger on a deal for this ELEMENT SOLO feeder. I’ll be returning it promptly before my 30 day money-back guarantee runs out.1st - the amount of information that you MUST input just to set up a feeding schedule is by far very un necessary. You have to create a profile for your animal, you have to enter their height, their weight, their age their type, then you need to input their food brand, THEN verify if it fits in the feeder, and THEN enter the ingredients and what %percentage of moisture and ash etc. etc. None of that is necessary when you’re using a measurement you already know and what type or amount of food you’re going to dispense. You just want to set up a schedule to have it done. BTW the plug is quite large, so I you’ll waste the space beside it, and above it, which is very unfortunate.2nd -my cat is on a strict food diet. His dry food portion of his diet he receives 1/4 (ONE QUARTER) cup of dry kibble (IAMS) TWICE a day to totaling 1/2 (ONE HALF) cup of food per day.By the third day, this feeder gave me issues, dispensing the incorrect amount of food. Sometimes it dispensed 16 kibbles. Sometimes it gave 48 kibbles. Sometimes it gave 62 kibbles. None of those equaled 1/4 cup as I tested it out for EACH of their dispensing measurements PRIOR to using it. The closest I could get to 1/4 cup of their measurements was 3/10 so I used that and set up a feeding plan per their requirements to automatically feed two times a day every 12 hours using the 3/10 dispensed amount. They use FIFTHS (1/5) measurements so it’s a little confusing trying to find what worked for 1/4 cup dispensing amounts. Then within that problem lies another one that’s even bigger. After posting a question about an accurate amounts, dispensed, and then reaching out to their support team, I found an answer. This feeder will only feed an APPROXIMATE amount of their dispensed portion (of 3/10 cup). Let that soak in for a minute. Give it a second. Really let it soak in.Now, let me give you a scenario. … Dr tells you, based on your weight, height and the food intake you can eat (lets use RICE) 1 cup of Rice per meal for a total of 3 cups rice per day. Ok Doc, great. I can do that.So, on your first meal, I hand you … oh, let’s say maybe 2/3 cup, and on your second meal, I hand you let’s say maybe 3/4, on your third meal, I hand you oh maybe 7/8th. You’re an adult, a senior even, so you “understand” what you’re allowed to have per meal and your rice is right there, in that square thing that makes a noise and gives you your rice but it’s not giving you what you’re allowed to have each meal. Would you be happy? Or full? or satisfied? Or always thinking about food and how to get it out of that thing. Because if it’s edible (& sometimes even if it’s not edible) you’ll attempt to get it and eat it. Because all you do is EAT, SLEEP, POOP/PEE, PLAY & PURRTo finish, I would like to quote the review of another Amazon verified purchase user, Jessica (3 years ago! man I SHOULD’VE dug deeper)“ Jessica4.0 out of 5 starsVerified PurchaseBasic features work well, unnecessarily complex app makes setup a painReviewed in the United States on May 12, 2020I think my title basically says it all, but I'm not really a brief person so here goes...On the whole, I'm very pleased with the quality of the build of this product, and the ease of filling and cleaning, which are really paramount concerns for something like this. Unboxing and putting everything together is easy, and so far the feeder has been reliable.That said, I think the app is a lot more complex than it needs to be, and while that can be updated and changed over time, it's important to know what you're getting into.When you go through setup of the feeder and app for the first time, I think the experience is a bit all over the place. There are instruction stickers on the feeder itself, there is a booklet of instructions, there are QR codes and links within the booklet to scan to get to videos that you have to watch for further steps, and then there's setup within the app itself... etc. I think it's just a few too many layers of info and could be pared down significantly. Once everything is setup and you're trying to actually use the app, those same issues of unnecessary layers/ complications continue. The app tries to get you to schedule meals based on feeding recommendations for your pet, so you have to setup a profile for each of your pets first. This sounds minor, but it's quite detailed, and includes a whole lot of information that isn't truly necessary just to make a recommendation for feeding quantity. In the end, a truly informed recommendation would really require nutrition information about your pet food itself, so the whole exercise is a bit silly. I was left feeling a bit unsure of how much of this information I *really* needed or wanted to complete. Once you have been asked about various details for your pet, then you need to schedule fixed meals for each, and again I do appreciate that they tried to include a lot of options for customization, but it's just too much. For one, how do they propose that you make sure the right pet eats the right meal, etc? I think it would be much easier to remove those options, or hide them behind an advanced mode, and just let you set a very simple schedule with set times and quantities. K.I.S.S. you know? Given that the app doesn't interface with bluetooth trackers or smart catboxes or anything like that, I'm not sure I see any need for the pet profiles at all! It just adds complexity for no discernible reason.Beyond the actual cumbersome data entry requirements, I found the interface to be not very intuitive. I had difficulty finding the settings that I actually wanted to look for and find out more about, such as the Alexa integration, and kept getting lost in layers of social media integrations and gamification... which, why? I was looking into trying out the Smart Home integration options, but do I need a community and messaging platform for my smart feeder? Maybe this is more of a cultural thing, I believe the company is based in China, but I just don't need this kind of fluff cluttering up the basic functions of the app. I'd really enjoy it more if they could pull back on these added features, or again, maybe just hide them all in one area of the app called 'Social' or similar, but they seemed to be behind every corner. For me, again it just took away from the experience of feeling like I could find the basic information and functions quickly and easily. Thankfully, apps can be can be improved and refined over time, so I feel that most of those concerns are somewhat secondary. If you plan to use it in a way where you can sit down and get through it, then basically 'set it and forget it', I think it will work well for you. But if you would plan to regularly make any tweaks to your meal plans, I think it would be a not-minor annoyance. I'll also mention that this is something my partner and I considered setting up for aging parents, just as a little convenience item to make their lives easier. After working with it, I don't know if I can comfortably go that direction. I definitely don't feel confident that they would have gotten through any of the initial setup themselves, but I also don't think they could make any on-the-fly changes to the configuration even if the initial steps were done for them. My advice to the developers would be: pare down to the basics and make sure they are quick and intuitive. THEN add extras, but remember they are extras and not your primary functions.Ok, so it seems like I'm coming down kind of harsh. All that said, I do think this product will work just fine for use in my own home. The feeder itself is sturdy and has so far been reliable. While I don't have direct experience with a lot of competing products, I had been taking note of some other design issues I'd noted in some of those competitors and waited to try something that seemed to address them. For one, I don't just appreciate the option for plug-in power and battery backup, for me that's an absolute requirement on something like this. The food storage compartment also seems secure, which was a concern I had because I have one cat that will get into ANYTHING edible that is left out. I'm impressed because he hasn't even tried with this, which also tells me the seals are probably decent and he's not being tempted by the smell of kibble. That also leads me to believe that bugs shouldn't be an issue, though time will tell. I also appreciate that the actual food bowl portion is easily removable, as it just snaps into place with a magnet. Being plastic based, it's important to clean something like that regularly and you and I both know that won't happen if it's a pain point. Ideally, I would really like to see this component and the food storage bin being made out of stainless steel, but maybe that's something that could be incorporated in a future revision as well.Let's wrap this up...On the whole, if you are patient and technologically competent enough to get through the configuration of the app itself, it's a good product that I think you'll be happy with.9 people found this helpful”” …”"", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 8, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Must use your cellphone.', 'author': 'Connie M.

I did order a 2nd one so that both cats would be eating at the same speed.But the one cat just shuffles between both dishes and the other cat doesn't eat (it's been days and he's only had a few bites each day, after a week it did manage to eat one bowl). Started feeding the starving cat in another room, only to have the 1st cat paw and scratch at the door for the hour it took the other cat to eat, and he still doesn't finish his portion. And the cat still vomits, so there really is not point for us to suffer using these cat dishes in our house. Might work with just one cat but doesn't work with two. Sorry, but not a product we can use. Excellent quality though and really cute dishes, they just don't work for us.Our cats hate it! We ordered this hoping to slow down one cat that eats fast and tends to vomit almost nightly. But his sister eats even faster (but never vomits) and then pushes him out of his new slow feeder dish and eats the rest of his food - so he just walks off. So, we figured we'd give the fast eater the slow feeder bowl to slow her down, but she just pushes her brother off his dish and they both ignore the slow feeder.We are ordering a 2nd slow feeder and putting both cats on them - to see if they both will adjust if they have no other option (they both certainly need to slow down their eating speed).If we can't get them to adjust fairly quick - within a few days, then we will be returning both dishes.The dishes/bowls are fantastic on their own. Very well made. Heavy, and stay put, and the cats don't tip them over. Easy to wash and dry. Nice height to them as well and low edges so cats do not get whisper fatigue using them.

This is how I use it, food goes on both end bowls and water is kept in the center bowl to separate both cats. Our previous elevated stand only had two slots which mean water had to go elsewhere on the ground. I couldn't keep a water bowl on the ground because one of the cats would flip it over all the time when she demands our attention. Now there is no flipping over of the water bowl when it is firmly in place on the elevated platform that has a slot for each bowl.There was some assembly required to screw in the metal legs to the wood platform. The screws were small so it took me a little while to do by hand. It did come with a printout of directions on how to do it, which I appreciated.This also came with a feeding mat to place the feeder on, what a bonus! Thank you for that!My only wish is that at least two of the bowls were a little more shallow and a little more wide to prevent cat whiskers from touching the walls of the bowl (whisker fatigue).

My cat drinks from hers a lot since she naps a lot in her window seat & this makes it right there handy & convenient w/out much effort! I highly recommend getting one for your cat. Cats in particular (esp. indoor cats) stay in a perpetual dehydrated state due to their natural wild design. In the wild, cats get their hydration & water intake from prey almost exclusively; so they don't have a thirst drive like dogs, humans & other animals. If you feed your cat dry food, your cat is really hurting for water even if they don't seem like it or act like. PLEASE switch to wet food! It is so much better for them & saves their kidneys & bladder from stones, extremely painful cystitis & a lot of suffering in life. Cats also don't show pain like dogs; so they are not going to tell you or show it. Anything that helps my cat remember to drink I'm all for & this item helps in that endeavor w/out a doubt. Again, cats need the reminder & constant access b/c they do not have a natural thirst drive at all! They stick great on the window & knock on wood have not had any issues, falls or it coming unattached. It's very sturdy, nice size bowl & holds water well. One note, if the bowl sits in window that gets direct sunlight, PLEASE check it for temp.& replace the water DAILY in case it gets too hot & the water gets a funny metallic taste from the heated up stainless steal. I have not used it w/food but would not hesitate to. I don't have any dogs that require the food be kept up high or food separated. I bought this from an online store the first time & they sold out. I was so happy to find it on Amazon & at a similar price, just a few dollars more.

I own 4 brands of pet feeders. They all work about the same. This one was cheap enough I bought one for my mom’s cat as well. I like the east clean stainless steel bowl that sits in the plastic bowl for easy cleaning, not all come with a steel bowl. I wish it had two for swapping. It has a compartment for back up batteries. I like the ability to feed through out the day at set times and amounts. This one is easy to clean between fills.Two things I don’t like as much is the front clean look is great unless you want to use the settings. It faces the wall so I have to pick it up to get to the controls. If I want to give a manual feed, I now just open the top to get some out. My other feeder has a button that allows me to feed manually easily. My one piece of advice is to make sure you use proper sized pebbles, if they are too big they can get stuck and not fall properly. It can be funny to watch the cats come running to an empty drop though, they are use to hearing its dinner time now. I have them set in different rooms and they make the rounds looking for food, getting more exercise and less pre filled bowls which is what the vet recommended.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 21, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Size', 'author': 'Linda Metcalf', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Was the right size my the room my cats are in.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 25, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Helpful, a few minor things are annoying.', 'author': 'Alex Denham', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'I like the idea of this a lot. I sometimes stay over at a friends, don’t get home until late, or decide to sleep in one morning when I have a day off from work, and my cats will whine and complain so much about it because the food in their bowl is stale or they just know it’s not fresh and they HAVE to have fresh food.. this is helpful in those times and it helps keep the food fresh for them because it has the lid that covers the air vent at the top.The programming is relatively easy once you understand how it functions, but I definitely needed to read the instructions first or I would not have understood how to use the lock/unlock feature or what button to hold and for how long. Also, I would be aware that If you plan to use the power cord to an outlet then you will be fine, but the cordless feature requires 6 D batteries! Those are the giant round ones, and they are not cheap. So I would not recommend this if you plan to use it without plugging it in. But the batteries can also just function as a backup power supply in the event that you have a power outage, which I guess is a good idea to have, just in case, and that wouldn’t run thru those expensive batteries very fast.The one thing I do find really strange and a bit annoying is the way you set the amount of food to dispense is through “portions”, but one portion is like 6-10 individual pieces of food… it doesn’t seem accurate that one portion is 1/8 of a cup like it says. To get the amount I need for 2 cats I had to set it for 6 portions twice a day which just seems a bit odd, but now that it’s set it works and is a great help.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 9, 2023', 'is_verified': False}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars On time feedings every day', 'author': 'Jessica D.', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I recently acquired this wireless automatic pet feeder, and let me tell you, it's been a total game-changer for my canine companion. Despite being marketed as a cat feeder, I seamlessly adapted it to suit my dog's feeding schedule. Managing two meals a day, each dispensing a precise 2 cups of kibble, has never been easier.What truly sets this feeder apart is the ability to record my own voice for feeding reminders. It's like a personal touch, even when I'm not around. This feeder allows you to record a personal message, and it will be played right before the meal is dispensed. It’s an adorable and personal touch. The initial setup was a breeze, thanks to straightforward instructions. However, disassembly for cleaning, which I undertake weekly (sometimes twice), is a tad more intricate.The packaging impressed me – a box within a box ensured a secure delivery. Powering this feeder with three D alkaline batteries grants an impressive 180-day battery life. This makes feedings so much easier at my house. I just have to clean the batteries up to date, keep dog food around, and the machine clean.The scheduled meal feature has eradicated issues like overeating, vomiting, and esophagitis. I appreciate the thoughtful design, including a built-in desiccant box in the BPA-free tank that keeps the kibble fresh and crunchy. The stainless steel bowl is dishwasher-safe, and very hygienic eating space for my pup. Equipped with a torque motor, this feeder eliminates concerns about food jams and missed feedings. I only use this feeder with dry kibbles or freeze-dried food. This wireless automatic pet feeder has exceeded my expectations, providing a reliable, convenient, and safe solution to streamline my dog's mealtime routine. She has food allergies and need a strict diet with the same time schedule. This has made the diet scheduling and elimination a lot easier. The size of this feeder works well for my dog now, but she is a German shepherd so I’m not sure how long we will have it around. I purchased this product in white, again, it’s very easy to clean, I’ve had a little over a month and no stains, still looks brand new. Im also still on my first set of batteries.

In the past i have simply used a gravity self-feeding device but the idea of having exact control over the time and amount of feeding is best for keeping kitty at the right weight, etc.training me: the automatic feeder is pretty easy to put together. The programming of it is moderately easy too. But if you have trouble programming your microwave or your television remote, make sure to have a ten-year-old nearby to help you because there is a fair amount of complexity to getting the feeding schedule, the feeding amount and the timing all set up exactly as you would like it to be. On the positive side, i found the instructions to be clearly written and that’s always helpful.Oh and the automatic feeder can be used attached to a wall outlet. A wall adapter (a 100V AC to 5V DC adapter) comes with it along with a changing cable. But i decided to use the feeder remote by installing 3 alkaline D-bateries. In my situation the flexibility of being able to place the feeder “anywhere” won outtraining the cat: Since kitty currently gets a mixture of wet and dry catfood, i had to come up with a training plan to teach her to eat all dry (since the machine cannot handle wet, canned catfood.) I decided to mix kitty’s current dry kibble with small tuna-flavored treats that are equally dry but - according to kitty - are irresistible. That mixture got kitty to eat timidly out of the stainless steel bowl whenever the machine dispensed some food. kitty was quick to figure out what the sound of the food being dispensed was - no issues there. But she seemed spooked by the mirror-like stainless steel bowl. (Kitty was feral till she became an indoor cat some nine years ago. so she still retains some of those feral ways that kept her alive back then.) So - bottom line - it will likely take weeks for kitty to totally adapt to the new process but that’s OK. Your kitty might find it far easier to become acclimated to new things.i plan to use this automatic feeder as kitty’s only source of food till she is 100% comfortable with it.

When the food is out, our more aggressive kitten will push the other kitten out of the way each and every time until he's had his fill.

This allows us to give our cat a larger meal portion in the morning, and smaller portions later on.This product seems to be well designed and manufactured and works quite well, so far. One negative, was that our cat was quickly able to find a way to disengage the plastic bowl holder and bowl from the disperser, and one of his early meals went on to the floor. He ate it anyway. We were able to find an easy workaround by placing the feeder on a small tray with a slight rim.If your cat is driving you crazy with his or her food cravings then an automatic food dispenser might be exactly what you need.

The first time I set it up (on not a so strong 2.4 ghz WiFi) it spun and spun. I finally hit the back button and it showed that it was already connected. So there’s some glitch there (but it DID connect). Additionally, when I connected it to the 5ghz network it didn’t do that. So who knows. Just watch for it when you’re trying to add it and if it seems like it won’t pair.This would have been our second feeder so I’m familiar with the concept. It has a sound bite that’s about 20x the volume of our previous one. I actually had to turn it off because it scared me and the cats (and would have woken us up to my shrill “kitty… come here kitty …. Time to eat…. Smooch smooch smooch”. 😖)Also, it was a little wobbly and felt cheaply made. I wound up trying it with none of the legs though as my cats like to plop like loaves on the floor when they eat. The lid just felt like thin plastic compared to the lid I was used to with my other dispenser.Ultimately what did it in was the design of dispensation. We use freeze dried chicken that I cut up and it wasn’t steep enough for the chicken to actually come out of the shoot. I tried it with actual kibble (which my cats wouldn’t eat- they don’t like kibble) and it worked like a charm. But with the lighter, oddly shaped freeze dried chicken bits, it just wasn’t a match. (I know it CAN work from the previous dispenser which is finally getting old after 3 years).I think if you use kibble, you don’t work from home (so you’re not being scared by your voice and you think your cat will enjoy it), and you have carpet or a way to help with the potential wobble of the legs, this could be a really great dispenser. It has great camera quality, you can choose to set up notifications when there’s movement in front of it, there’s two way audio on it, and you can remotely dispense treats from it. It has pretty much everything you could want.As long as you’re using a small projectile food.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 28, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Can’t fill it with a lot', 'author': 'Pablo', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I use this for my two doggos.

We’ve had it for a few months now and have to add food constantly because it won’t hold too much food. The weight of filling it up to the top seems to make the motor stop.

I also hated having multiple alarms set on my phone to feed them as well, it was simply a hassle and I needed to simplify their feeding process.So I purchased this after doing research for a couple of weeks and while I love that I can set multiple feeding schedules and have them set for certain days only or every day, as well as being able to see the girls while we're gone and talk to them, this thing started clogging up almost immediately. At one time we did have 2 different sized foods in the machine but according to all the foods indicated, the larger pieces, still shouldn't have jammed it. Either way, we dumped it all, stopped putting the larger food in and after a couple of days, it once again jammed. I have dumped this feeder at least 3-4 times now, shaken the heck out of it, put my fingers up the dispensing area to also try to fix it but nothing works.All in all, while I love the camera, the portion sizes, and the scheduling, the way this dispenses food, is a real problem and the chute and dispenser area need to be redesigned.

This product, however, has a small one-inch diameter hole in the water-bowl section so Sabrina doesn\'t try to stick her paw in there to play with her water. Therefore, the water stays clean. Nor can she drag her bowl around since this 3-bowl product comes with a vinyl floor-mat which makes dragging them around difficult. I didn\'t know about having the food-bowls a little higher and at an angle in order for older cats, like my Sabrina, to not feel any back pain. That was new to me.

So far so good. I ordered 3 bowls—one for each cat and a third for extra food for during the day (I thought they were smaller but they are a very nice size actually). They arrived 5 days ago, we have yet to have a vomiting incident which is unheard of with the younger one, both cats are totally into them, and they are heavy enough that no one has managed to knock one over, me included.

Each little tick mark equates to 30 minutes. Honestly, I'm not sure what the other reviews are complaining about regarding the noise. I had to put my ear to the feeder to hear the ticking and make sure it was working, and it made a small sound when the lids popped open that my husband and I didn't even notice. Dropping a wand cat toy on the floor was louder than this. I wouldn't recommend leaving wet food in for longer than 12 hours as the ice packs won't stay cold that long, but that's just how ice packs work if you really think about it. If you need to leave food for longer than 12 hours, you can put dry food in no problem. I also saw someone suggest in another product's reviews that you could probably freeze your wet food before placing it in the feeder to keep it fresh for longer than 12 hours, although I have not tried this. I love how shallow the bowls are as it provides whisker relief for the cats. We use this when we aren't going to be home in time to feed our cat dinner, so that he can eat at his normal time. It also works for if you're going on an overnight trip to give dinner and breakfast as needed. Make sure to use new or fully charged batteries. I love the battery component as it lets us put this anywhere in our apartment without needing to worry about access to an outlet (which is very limited in our apartment). Just make sure to replace the batteries as needed. The bowls clean very easily in the dishwasher and everything else can be wiped down. This is honestly a lifesaver for our busy lives so we don't have to keep asking friends to visit our apartment to feed our cat if we won't make it home by dinner time/breakfast. This probably wouldn't be practical for everyday use, but this really isn't designed for that unless you want to fill it up and reset the timers every day. It is perfect for short-term traveling, and our cat adjusted to this immediately.The only issue we had was that the little red line for one of the timers came off? It's like a sticker or something, but there is a little indent where it is supposed to be so we just used a marker to fill in that indent.

If that had more plastic under it, it would make it really hard for ants to get in, and would even allow you to add water to create a true ant moat. (Haven\'t had to deal with it yet, but where we live the ants mostly come in looking for water in the summer anyway, so not sure even that would keep them away.)To be clear, the manufacturer makes no claims that this will keep ants away. The moat is primarily for catching your kitty\'s mess.

I put all 3 bowls in. Well, the center bowl sat completely flat with no issues. The two on the ends did not. They hit the nut so they would not go in all the way.

I used 2 of my own washers and put them on the outside (the knob side) which then allowed the bowls to drop all the way in and sit flat.Then I noticed that the whole platform that held the bowls would rotate back and forth. I tried tightening everything but that wasn't the problem. The way the board is cut to fit the black leg is at an angle so it doesn't fit snugly. The only level that does fit snug is the very bottom level.

The ""Cat Bowls, Upgraded 13 oz Ceramic Elevated Cat Food Bowls for Food and Water"" have proven to be a delightful addition to our cat\'s feeding routine.First and foremost, the elevated design of these bowls has been a game-changer. My cat, Whiskers, used to struggle with her mealtime, often hunching over her old floor-level bowls, which resulted in digestive discomfort. With these elevated cat bowls, she can now comfortably access her food and water without straining her neck. This design has significantly reduced the instances of post-meal regurgitation and has visibly improved her digestion.The ceramic material is another standout feature of these bowls. The smooth and non-porous surface not only makes them easy to clean but also keeps Whiskers\' food and water fresh and free from any lingering odors. The sturdy construction ensures they remain stable even during enthusiastic eating sessions, which is a relief for both of us.I\'m also impressed with the 13 oz capacity of each bowl. It provides ample room for a satisfying meal and generous hydration, perfect for my medium-sized cat. I no longer find myself refilling the water bowl multiple times a day, and Whiskers appreciates the continuous access to fresh water.Furthermore, the elegant design and neutral color of these bowls complement our home decor seamlessly. They add a touch of sophistication to our pet\'s feeding area, making it a more pleasant space for both Whiskers and us.Lastly, the packaging and shipping were handled with care, and the product arrived in pristine condition. It\'s evident that the manufacturer values customer satisfaction.In conclusion, the ""Cat Bowls, Upgraded 13 oz Ceramic Elevated Cat Food Bowls for Food and Water"" have exceeded my expectations in terms of functionality and aesthetics.

One is fine for dry kibble (or even wet food), but the other one doesn't hold a whole lot of water. And this might not be an especially big problem, but the issue comes when you enable the tilt feature - the dish already doesn't hold a whole lot of water, but when you tilt it 30 degrees (or whatever the angle of the tilt), then the bowl can hold even less water... so we're refilling our dog's water dish a WHOLE LOT more often now than we used to, and sometimes she'll be out of water for possibly more than a day without us realizing.Overall it's still a pretty good product and fits our dog's size nicely, and we're still using it, but I wish the water dish had a different design to accommodate for the tilt, so that it could hold more water."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 6, 2024', 'is_verified': False}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Love the thought put into these bowls!', 'author': 'Christi L.', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I got these bowls for my 17 lb kitty, because I noticed that her food would spill into her water with her other feeder, and I wanted something that I could just devote to her water and keep it clean.

I'm Shocked How Good It Is!"", 'author': 'Ryan A. Leemhuis', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'A little background first. We had previously used the Crown Majestic feeder for our cat. It worked fairly well although it was a bit ugly, would occasionally jam and the portion sizes were very hit and miss. We used it until its power connection internally broke and it would only run off batteries which was difficult to keep up with.So that led me on my search for a replacement. There are a lot more options now than there used to be. My main features I was looking for were wifi control and reliability.I found it difficult to narrow down my choice as I found varying reviews and some claimed that a model was terrible and some said it was amazing. I eventually settled on the Petkit mini feeder from a cost and design perspective. First of all, it looks great. I love the thought that went into the design from the magnetically attached bowl to the jumper that allows the DC adapter to easily disconnect from the wall should you need. I was a little nervous about how much food could be stored but upon seeing the compartment this is a good amount for a cat. I find we need to fill it once every 2 weeks or so.That brings us to the worst part of the product. Lets just be clear here...the app is decent...but there are some language oddities and the setup did not go according to design. I am a techy and I initially tried pairing the feeder with my phone. It got fairly far into the setup but kept failing out during the wifi pairing process. I then tried my wife\'s phone and it did the same. I then happened to notice that the feeder was already showing on the app\'s dashboard and sure enough it had been paired even though the app claimed it had failed. I don\'t know why this occurred but be prepared for some setup issues.Once setup, however, the app is great. The food portion sizes are accurate and on demand feeds occur nearly immediately. The schedule is easy to setup and food is distributed on time. We use prescription ""disc-shaped"" food and other feeders claimed they weren\'t compatible. We have had ZERO issues with this machine getting jammed or having any issue with our food. It is actually very fun to watch the little door open on the machine and then the food dump out.For the cost, this feeder is a steal. It is so much better than our previous feeder it makes me wonder why I didn\'t upgrade earlier. My only suggestions for improvement would be to further improve the app and instructions translations. There are some real English oddities (which you can see in the product\'s amazon page as well. In addition, the setup process obviously needs some improvement too as it failed twice for me and some how magically appeared on my apps dashboard after this fail. Other than that, the feeder is perfect. It feels very high quality and the mechanics seem sound.

It looks like it belongs in an art museum.The PetKit Mini feeder is the ideal automatic feeder for my needs. What I like best is that it precisely delivers very small meals (as little as 1/20 of a cup or 5 grams) to my overweight cat up to 10 times per day. In my case I had been feeding my cat 20 grams of cat kibbles twice per day... or 40 grams. My cat was waking me up at 4 AM begging for more food. The PetKit Mini stopped the begging behavior! With the PetKit Mini I was able to schedule 8 feedings of 5 grams each... for a total of 40 grams per day... but spread out over the course of the day and night. This way my cat gets precisely fed her reduced ration and eliminates my tendency to give her a little extra when she begs.The PetKit Mini has improved my cat's relationship with me. She no longer relies on me for food. With the PetKit Mini she visits me often and regularly because she wants my company... not because she wants food. And it has improved my relationship with my cat since I am no longer irritated by her pestering behaviors at 4 AM when she gets hungry.The engineers who designed the PetKit Mini payed very close attention to critical details that separate this feeder from the pack. I studied them all before I made my purchase decision. The silicone rubber paddles that meter the kibbles into the rotary dosing cups are designed to flex so the kibbles don’t jam in the mechanism.The engineers used silicone rubber gaskets to seal out moisture at the feeding door and food reservoir lid. Then they provide a replaceable desiccant pack (those little packs that you often find in a box of new shoes) that absorb any moisture that might otherwise accumulate in your dried food. You can imagine that if your kibbles absorbed moisture from the air and swelled up like a sponge that they wouldn’t feed well in the mechanism. It also keeps the food fresher and prevents mold growth I would think.I found the PetKit Mini was easy to set up. It did help that I had an $8 electronic scale so I could better measure in grams how much I had been feeding my cat. I had been using a very small measuring cup. It was a lot easier to weigh the kibbles than to try to measure the volume of food.I measured the amount of food the PetKit Mini delivered with each feeding. I did this 8 times just to see how repeatable the feedings were. With my dry kibbles the average amount of each feeding was 4.97 grams. Pretty good if you were targeting 5 grams! (The standard deviation was 0.31 grams… who remembers what a standard deviation is???)Since I am only feeding my cat 40 grams per day the food reservoir is large enough for storing a 37 day supply. I can just check the food level once per month to be safe… but the PetKit Mini is designed with a monitor that will alert me when the food is low. What a great feature! It will also remind me every 30 days to replace the desiccant pack. I found some after-market desiccant packs on EBay that will fit the PetKit Mini because I couldn’t find any OEM packs online.This is a great automatic WiFI cat feeder! I liked it so much I bought a second PetKit Mini for my daughter for Christmas. She too has an overweight cat (though not for long).

First you have to connect your phone to your 2.5GHz wifi, then you connect your phone to this thing\'s ""wifi"", and somehow it uses that to get this thing connected to the 2.5GHz wifi that your phone was connected to. After you get it setup though, you have to contend with the really UN-intuitive software. Once you have overcome both of those headaches, the feeder works really well. I almost took off 1 star for the pain in the *** setup and user interface, bit in spite of the those annoyances, I like this feeder so much that I decided to give it the full 5. I\'m so happy that it can dispense portions in increments as small as 1/20th of a cup. I use this feeder to give my cat a small snack in between her normal meals, so that tiny portion size is greatly appreciated. It\'s so nice to be able to adjust the feeding from my phone. We used to go out to eat and hang out with friends until late at night all the time and we always worried about making our cat wait for dinner until we got home, but now (once we can finally go out again) we can just use our phone to give our cat some dinner as soon as we realize we won\'t be getting home until late.Another thing I like about this feeder is that the build quality is really nice. The food tray attaches magnetically so is easy to take off, clean, and re-attach. The food sits inside an inner basket within the feeder, so it keeps all the food crumbs contained. All the parts fit together very precisely so it feels sturdy and looks really nice.

It's a stockier feeder so it's hard to knock over. It's feed buttons are on the side and requires you to hold them to dispense food manually. Also the cat can't reach a impeller to vend food. It even has a dessicant (oxygen absorber) you can add to keep food fresh in the feeder. I ended up buying some replacements that you can heat up to reuse as a cost saving measure. This pet kit feeder includes a HD camera and a speaker and microphone if you want to talk to your cats or set recorded messages during feeding times. You can set detailed feeding times and has an easy way to stop a feeding in case you want to feed them wet food.

I'm Shocked How Good It Is!"", 'author': 'Ryan A. Leemhuis', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'A little background first. We had previously used the Crown Majestic feeder for our cat. It worked fairly well although it was a bit ugly, would occasionally jam and the portion sizes were very hit and miss. We used it until its power connection internally broke and it would only run off batteries which was difficult to keep up with.So that led me on my search for a replacement. There are a lot more options now than there used to be. My main features I was looking for were wifi control and reliability.I found it difficult to narrow down my choice as I found varying reviews and some claimed that a model was terrible and some said it was amazing. I eventually settled on the Petkit mini feeder from a cost and design perspective. First of all, it looks great. I love the thought that went into the design from the magnetically attached bowl to the jumper that allows the DC adapter to easily disconnect from the wall should you need. I was a little nervous about how much food could be stored but upon seeing the compartment this is a good amount for a cat. I find we need to fill it once every 2 weeks or so.That brings us to the worst part of the product. Lets just be clear here...the app is decent...but there are some language oddities and the setup did not go according to design. I am a techy and I initially tried pairing the feeder with my phone. It got fairly far into the setup but kept failing out during the wifi pairing process. I then tried my wife\'s phone and it did the same. I then happened to notice that the feeder was already showing on the app\'s dashboard and sure enough it had been paired even though the app claimed it had failed. I don\'t know why this occurred but be prepared for some setup issues.Once setup, however, the app is great. The food portion sizes are accurate and on demand feeds occur nearly immediately. The schedule is easy to setup and food is distributed on time. We use prescription ""disc-shaped"" food and other feeders claimed they weren\'t compatible. We have had ZERO issues with this machine getting jammed or having any issue with our food. It is actually very fun to watch the little door open on the machine and then the food dump out.For the cost, this feeder is a steal. It is so much better than our previous feeder it makes me wonder why I didn\'t upgrade earlier. My only suggestions for improvement would be to further improve the app and instructions translations. There are some real English oddities (which you can see in the product\'s amazon page as well. In addition, the setup process obviously needs some improvement too as it failed twice for me and some how magically appeared on my apps dashboard after this fail. Other than that, the feeder is perfect. It feels very high quality and the mechanics seem sound.

It looks like it belongs in an art museum.The PetKit Mini feeder is the ideal automatic feeder for my needs. What I like best is that it precisely delivers very small meals (as little as 1/20 of a cup or 5 grams) to my overweight cat up to 10 times per day. In my case I had been feeding my cat 20 grams of cat kibbles twice per day... or 40 grams. My cat was waking me up at 4 AM begging for more food. The PetKit Mini stopped the begging behavior! With the PetKit Mini I was able to schedule 8 feedings of 5 grams each... for a total of 40 grams per day... but spread out over the course of the day and night. This way my cat gets precisely fed her reduced ration and eliminates my tendency to give her a little extra when she begs.The PetKit Mini has improved my cat's relationship with me. She no longer relies on me for food. With the PetKit Mini she visits me often and regularly because she wants my company... not because she wants food. And it has improved my relationship with my cat since I am no longer irritated by her pestering behaviors at 4 AM when she gets hungry.The engineers who designed the PetKit Mini payed very close attention to critical details that separate this feeder from the pack. I studied them all before I made my purchase decision. The silicone rubber paddles that meter the kibbles into the rotary dosing cups are designed to flex so the kibbles don’t jam in the mechanism.The engineers used silicone rubber gaskets to seal out moisture at the feeding door and food reservoir lid. Then they provide a replaceable desiccant pack (those little packs that you often find in a box of new shoes) that absorb any moisture that might otherwise accumulate in your dried food. You can imagine that if your kibbles absorbed moisture from the air and swelled up like a sponge that they wouldn’t feed well in the mechanism. It also keeps the food fresher and prevents mold growth I would think.I found the PetKit Mini was easy to set up. It did help that I had an $8 electronic scale so I could better measure in grams how much I had been feeding my cat. I had been using a very small measuring cup. It was a lot easier to weigh the kibbles than to try to measure the volume of food.I measured the amount of food the PetKit Mini delivered with each feeding. I did this 8 times just to see how repeatable the feedings were. With my dry kibbles the average amount of each feeding was 4.97 grams. Pretty good if you were targeting 5 grams! (The standard deviation was 0.31 grams… who remembers what a standard deviation is???)Since I am only feeding my cat 40 grams per day the food reservoir is large enough for storing a 37 day supply. I can just check the food level once per month to be safe… but the PetKit Mini is designed with a monitor that will alert me when the food is low. What a great feature! It will also remind me every 30 days to replace the desiccant pack. I found some after-market desiccant packs on EBay that will fit the PetKit Mini because I couldn’t find any OEM packs online.This is a great automatic WiFI cat feeder! I liked it so much I bought a second PetKit Mini for my daughter for Christmas. She too has an overweight cat (though not for long).

Instead of a simple-to-use barcode reader that searches online and enters the food analysis for me, I have to enter the analysis manually. Okay, needlessly complicated but okay.The app lets me program the feeding schedule but I'm unable to vary the portion size. I ran a few trials and the portion size isn't consistent. That's a definite FAIL!!I have two PetKit water dispensors that work very well. The Petkit Pure Max Litter box works well.

The setup is really strange. First you have to connect your phone to your 2.5GHz wifi, then you connect your phone to this thing\'s ""wifi"", and somehow it uses that to get this thing connected to the 2.5GHz wifi that your phone was connected to. After you get it setup though, you have to contend with the really UN-intuitive software. Once you have overcome both of those headaches, the feeder works really well. I almost took off 1 star for the pain in the *** setup and user interface, bit in spite of the those annoyances, I like this feeder so much that I decided to give it the full 5. I\'m so happy that it can dispense portions in increments as small as 1/20th of a cup. I use this feeder to give my cat a small snack in between her normal meals, so that tiny portion size is greatly appreciated. It\'s so nice to be able to adjust the feeding from my phone. We used to go out to eat and hang out with friends until late at night all the time and we always worried about making our cat wait for dinner until we got home, but now (once we can finally go out again) we can just use our phone to give our cat some dinner as soon as we realize we won\'t be getting home until late.Another thing I like about this feeder is that the build quality is really nice. The food tray attaches magnetically so is easy to take off, clean, and re-attach. The food sits inside an inner basket within the feeder, so it keeps all the food crumbs contained. All the parts fit together very precisely so it feels sturdy and looks really nice. The door over the food chute is controlled by a little robotic arm, so my cat can\'t just push her paw up in there to steal more food.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States July 7, 2020', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect！！！！', 'author': 'yufei s.', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""This isn't the first time I've bought an automatic feeder.

It's a stockier feeder so it's hard to knock over. It's feed buttons are on the side and requires you to hold them to dispense food manually. Also the cat can't reach a impeller to vend food. It even has a dessicant (oxygen absorber) you can add to keep food fresh in the feeder. I ended up buying some replacements that you can heat up to reuse as a cost saving measure. This pet kit feeder includes a HD camera and a speaker and microphone if you want to talk to your cats or set recorded messages during feeding times. You can set detailed feeding times and has an easy way to stop a feeding in case you want to feed them wet food.

The big issue was that the two units, even though they were the same exact model, kept time differently. One was fast, the other was slow, so over the course of a week, we would have a gulf of about 2 1/2 minutes which resulted in hurt feelings and competition. Cue the third cat and we tried a different brand. That one kept time a little better, but we were still struggling with clocks that would never be synchronized and it was a chore to always update 3 feeders every few days just to ensure the cats were fed at their respective stations at the same time and no one had an opportunity to eat theirs and steal another's in the time it took for food to be dispensed.I had my eye on this, as it's WiFi enabled, and we already have the automatic litter box, so we were familiar with the brand. I bought a couple to trial and they have worked wonders so far, the internet connectivity ensures they are dispensing at almost identical times, rather than relying on an onboard clock. So, we purchased a third, and will purchase a fourth and fifth once the kittens are a bit bigger.Setting up the feeding plan is a breeze and refilling couldn't be easier. I also like the shallow bowl because it does keep whisker fatigue to a minimum as they don't have to bury their heads too deep to reach their food.Set up was a breeze as well. It was very easy to connect as the device was easily recognized and firmware updates took moments without any failures. The app works great with virtually no delays in input - want to give them a little snack? Tap the snack button, select your serving size and it dispenses as soon as you make your choice.For the price and the features, it's a no brainer.

Update is bc people are saying this has a bad wifi system. I set up a separate 2.4G network off my main 5G network, and it works perfectly fine. I get 2-3 wifi Bars on my phone from where the feeder is so I do have a good network connection. Only have about avg 700-800mbps wifi and a ton of other items in the home like security cameras and smart plugs with multiple roommates also tech heavy, so the issue is definitely not with the feeder (unless they got a defective one idk). I did have my power go out once but due to the battery backup the feeder still dispensed food on time and reconnected to the wifi when the power came back on without me having to do anything. Also read someone said the app didn’t work with an iPhone. I have a newer iPhone and the app was super easy, as if I was downloading any other app (Instagram, etc.). Updating bc I don’t want people to overlook this feeder bc of a few reviews that don’t always apply.So this feeder only had 8 reviews when I ordered it which is way low for my usual trust with a new brand. however, MY CATS LOVE THIS FEEDER. They weren’t intimidated by the size or layout. Very intuitive for my cats to use. Love that it’s also a plain clean look with the app (so far so good) and doesn’t have those tacky looking buttons on most automatic feeders. Extremely clean design which was a big factor in buying. The lid That seals is also nice. I picked up the feeder and turned it sideways just to see if it would spill, and it stayed secure with the latch they used.The installation was incredibly easy and straight forward. I expected it to be more intense. My cats use purina one kitten food mixed with purina one probiotic health adult food, and the dispenser has done very well with portion size mixed. Will update this if anything changes.The App really impressed me with how it logged my cats’ weights and age etc to help with portion control. I needed this bc I wasn’t sure how much to give my kitties after them being on an open bowl meal (but got too chunky hence the feeder & I am a student and not always home etc).Only Pros at this Point. I got the stainless steel option and highly recommend that bowl as opposed to the plastic. Your cat will appreciate it and it’s a lot easier to clean.The Green Color is exactly how the picture looks.

I\'ll update if it stops working or something. The app isn\'t super sleek and displays my feeding history partially in Chinese, but it\'s not too confusing either, and the feeder quickly connected to my iPhone on a 2.4G network. Set up was really easy, 2-3 minutes, and mostly I just use the ""extra feeding"" button, although the recommended meal plan seemed appropriate if all my cat ate was dry food, and was easy to edit. I like the green color and the stainless steel bowl.I\'ve only had it for a few weeks, with no problems. My cat is underweight, not food-motivated, usually eats raw or wet food, and was recently diagnosed with kidney issues and maybe isn\'t really supposed to be eating dry food anyway. However, he often refuses to eat his wet food, especially prescription food, before I leave for work. It\'s better for him to eat dry food than not eat at all, so I use this to send him small amounts food throughout the day and give me some peace of mind that if he wants to eat, he can (and that the food isn\'t super stale). I do wish the feeder could tell me if the cat has eaten any of the food in the bowl, and how much, instead of just logging how much has been dispensed. This way I could track his eating and avoid adding more food when he hasn\'t eaten... but maybe that\'s a lot to ask from a feeder? Anyway, having a remotely controlled feeder also means that if I find I\'m not going to be home for scheduled feeding times, it\'s not such a big deal, which is good because I live in a city with unpredictable traffic. I\'m pretty satisfied.Edit: I\'ve had the feeder for a while now to feed two cats on a schedule. It does have some bugs. The main issue is that it will double-dispense food randomly, some 10-20% of the time. I always receive a notification that it\'s working normally and has released the scheduled amount of food, but if I am home, I can see/hear that it dispenses, and then after about 30 seconds dispenses the same amount again, this time without sending any notification. This isn\'t as bad as if it were not dispensing any food at all, but it\'s a pain because one of my cats will happily overeat and get sick if I\'m not home to intervene. The only solution seems to be making meals even smaller so that when it double dispenses, it\'s not so much extra. I also somewhat frequently receive notifications that the feeder is jammed or low on food when it is not (maybe twice a month). The feeder has only actually jammed once.

I set them up some beds and a big food bowl in a shed but raccoons and possums were stealing the food. (And I was tired if going out in the rain to fill the bowl.) So I got this feeder and set it up in the shed. So far, this has held up well. The raccoons and possums can only steal 1/2 cup at a time. The raccoons get pretty aggressive when the bowl is empty but they haven\'t managed to get the lid off the new feeder. I\'ve seen them tossing it around on the security camera but the feeder\'s held up fine. I eventually attached it to the floor of the shed.I haven\'t set up a schedule because feral cats are terrible at telling time. If it\'s empty when I check the security camera, I hit ""Extra feeding"" on my phone and dump 1/2 cup in the bowl. It took the cats about 2 days to figure out that the noise means food. Sometimes I\'ll see 3 or 4 of them sitting in a semi-circle around the bowl waiting for me to hit the button.I\'ve run several brands of cat food thru it (whatever\'s on sale in bulk) and it\'s pretty consistent with the portion despite the different sizes and shapes of the kibble.

I’ve spent an incredible amount of time researching Cat Feeders ever since 2020 when PetNet (feeders) went out of business. They were the best in the industry, hands-down! and now I’m stuck with TWO of their $150 paper weights, essentially. I’ve searched far and wide for replacements. So on Amazon Prime Day, July 12, I pulled the trigger on a deal for this ELEMENT SOLO feeder. I’ll be returning it promptly before my 30 day money-back guarantee runs out.1st - the amount of information that you MUST input just to set up a feeding schedule is by far very un necessary. You have to create a profile for your animal, you have to enter their height, their weight, their age their type, then you need to input their food brand, THEN verify if it fits in the feeder, and THEN enter the ingredients and what %percentage of moisture and ash etc. etc. None of that is necessary when you’re using a measurement you already know and what type or amount of food you’re going to dispense. You just want to set up a schedule to have it done. BTW the plug is quite large, so I you’ll waste the space beside it, and above it, which is very unfortunate.2nd -my cat is on a strict food diet. His dry food portion of his diet he receives 1/4 (ONE QUARTER) cup of dry kibble (IAMS) TWICE a day to totaling 1/2 (ONE HALF) cup of food per day.By the third day, this feeder gave me issues, dispensing the incorrect amount of food. Sometimes it dispensed 16 kibbles. Sometimes it gave 48 kibbles. Sometimes it gave 62 kibbles. None of those equaled 1/4 cup as I tested it out for EACH of their dispensing measurements PRIOR to using it. The closest I could get to 1/4 cup of their measurements was 3/10 so I used that and set up a feeding plan per their requirements to automatically feed two times a day every 12 hours using the 3/10 dispensed amount. They use FIFTHS (1/5) measurements so it’s a little confusing trying to find what worked for 1/4 cup dispensing amounts. Then within that problem lies another one that’s even bigger. After posting a question about an accurate amounts, dispensed, and then reaching out to their support team, I found an answer. This feeder will only feed an APPROXIMATE amount of their dispensed portion (of 3/10 cup). Let that soak in for a minute. Give it a second. Really let it soak in.Now, let me give you a scenario. … Dr tells you, based on your weight, height and the food intake you can eat (lets use RICE) 1 cup of Rice per meal for a total of 3 cups rice per day. Ok Doc, great. I can do that.So, on your first meal, I hand you … oh, let’s say maybe 2/3 cup, and on your second meal, I hand you let’s say maybe 3/4, on your third meal, I hand you oh maybe 7/8th. You’re an adult, a senior even, so you “understand” what you’re allowed to have per meal and your rice is right there, in that square thing that makes a noise and gives you your rice but it’s not giving you what you’re allowed to have each meal. Would you be happy? Or full? or satisfied? Or always thinking about food and how to get it out of that thing. Because if it’s edible (& sometimes even if it’s not edible) you’ll attempt to get it and eat it. Because all you do is EAT, SLEEP, POOP/PEE, PLAY & PURRTo finish, I would like to quote the review of another Amazon verified purchase user, Jessica (3 years ago! man I SHOULD’VE dug deeper)“ Jessica4.0 out of 5 starsVerified PurchaseBasic features work well, unnecessarily complex app makes setup a painReviewed in the United States on May 12, 2020I think my title basically says it all, but I'm not really a brief person so here goes...On the whole, I'm very pleased with the quality of the build of this product, and the ease of filling and cleaning, which are really paramount concerns for something like this. Unboxing and putting everything together is easy, and so far the feeder has been reliable.That said, I think the app is a lot more complex than it needs to be, and while that can be updated and changed over time, it's important to know what you're getting into.When you go through setup of the feeder and app for the first time, I think the experience is a bit all over the place. There are instruction stickers on the feeder itself, there is a booklet of instructions, there are QR codes and links within the booklet to scan to get to videos that you have to watch for further steps, and then there's setup within the app itself... etc. I think it's just a few too many layers of info and could be pared down significantly. Once everything is setup and you're trying to actually use the app, those same issues of unnecessary layers/ complications continue. The app tries to get you to schedule meals based on feeding recommendations for your pet, so you have to setup a profile for each of your pets first. This sounds minor, but it's quite detailed, and includes a whole lot of information that isn't truly necessary just to make a recommendation for feeding quantity. In the end, a truly informed recommendation would really require nutrition information about your pet food itself, so the whole exercise is a bit silly. I was left feeling a bit unsure of how much of this information I *really* needed or wanted to complete. Once you have been asked about various details for your pet, then you need to schedule fixed meals for each, and again I do appreciate that they tried to include a lot of options for customization, but it's just too much. For one, how do they propose that you make sure the right pet eats the right meal, etc? I think it would be much easier to remove those options, or hide them behind an advanced mode, and just let you set a very simple schedule with set times and quantities. K.I.S.S. you know? Given that the app doesn't interface with bluetooth trackers or smart catboxes or anything like that, I'm not sure I see any need for the pet profiles at all! It just adds complexity for no discernible reason.Beyond the actual cumbersome data entry requirements, I found the interface to be not very intuitive. I had difficulty finding the settings that I actually wanted to look for and find out more about, such as the Alexa integration, and kept getting lost in layers of social media integrations and gamification... which, why? I was looking into trying out the Smart Home integration options, but do I need a community and messaging platform for my smart feeder? Maybe this is more of a cultural thing, I believe the company is based in China, but I just don't need this kind of fluff cluttering up the basic functions of the app. I'd really enjoy it more if they could pull back on these added features, or again, maybe just hide them all in one area of the app called 'Social' or similar, but they seemed to be behind every corner. For me, again it just took away from the experience of feeling like I could find the basic information and functions quickly and easily. Thankfully, apps can be can be improved and refined over time, so I feel that most of those concerns are somewhat secondary. If you plan to use it in a way where you can sit down and get through it, then basically 'set it and forget it', I think it will work well for you. But if you would plan to regularly make any tweaks to your meal plans, I think it would be a not-minor annoyance. I'll also mention that this is something my partner and I considered setting up for aging parents, just as a little convenience item to make their lives easier. After working with it, I don't know if I can comfortably go that direction. I definitely don't feel confident that they would have gotten through any of the initial setup themselves, but I also don't think they could make any on-the-fly changes to the configuration even if the initial steps were done for them. My advice to the developers would be: pare down to the basics and make sure they are quick and intuitive. THEN add extras, but remember they are extras and not your primary functions.Ok, so it seems like I'm coming down kind of harsh. All that said, I do think this product will work just fine for use in my own home. The feeder itself is sturdy and has so far been reliable. While I don't have direct experience with a lot of competing products, I had been taking note of some other design issues I'd noted in some of those competitors and waited to try something that seemed to address them. For one, I don't just appreciate the option for plug-in power and battery backup, for me that's an absolute requirement on something like this. The food storage compartment also seems secure, which was a concern I had because I have one cat that will get into ANYTHING edible that is left out. I'm impressed because he hasn't even tried with this, which also tells me the seals are probably decent and he's not being tempted by the smell of kibble. That also leads me to believe that bugs shouldn't be an issue, though time will tell. I also appreciate that the actual food bowl portion is easily removable, as it just snaps into place with a magnet. Being plastic based, it's important to clean something like that regularly and you and I both know that won't happen if it's a pain point. Ideally, I would really like to see this component and the food storage bin being made out of stainless steel, but maybe that's something that could be incorporated in a future revision as well.Let's wrap this up...On the whole, if you are patient and technologically competent enough to get through the configuration of the app itself, it's a good product that I think you'll be happy with.9 people found this helpful”” …”"", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 8, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Must use your cellphone.', 'author': 'Connie M.

Also included are adhesive felt pads if you need them for the bottoms of the legs, which is a nice touch. However, I do wish it came with one of those little ""L"" shaped screwdrivers, because I don\'t actually have a screwdriver short enough to access where the legs attach and have the screws go in straight. The screws are quite short, and I wasn\'t able to keep them straight because I needed a much shorter screwdriver, so they are crooked and I\'m hoping they\'re in far enough. The only other thing is if you place the bowl down for your cat with the legs straight, one of the pointy parts of the bowl holder is facing the cat. I have put it on my cat\'s placemat at an angle so she is facing one of the flat sides. This isn\'t a big deal at all, it\'s just a function of the hexagon shape of the bowl holder, but just something to be aware of.

The styrofoam was melted onto the bowl in several spots with wisps of strand like threads coming off it. I cleaned it, pretty easily, immediately after receiving it.The bowl is a decent size but I was under the assumption it was a pair of bowls, yet you only receive one; maybe the wording was different or I read it wrong when the title mention bowls (plural), regardless… it’s only a single bowl.My cats have no trouble or problems eating from it, but I do worry of whisker fatigue and that’ll usually show itself after awhile. The reason I decided to get this bowl was the ‘darkening’ of my cats chin from acne. We have only been using glass bowls and switched off plastic fountains a few months ago, I’m hoping that this bowl will help to correct that.The product says it’s dishwasher safe but I would be careful due to the structure of the bowl, has a hollow base and is pretty light, which would be a positive or negative depending on what your looking for.

This high, wide bowl received instant approval, not only by my wife and myself but by our very old cat. Our cats normally eat from small, LOW-sided, stainless-steel bowls. But our very old cat has demonstrated some trouble bending her head down recently – age. We put her normal food in the new cat bowl, set it on the floor and she immediately started eating out of it – no hesitation. The wide bowl also helps relieve whisker fatigue, which can cause stress over time. A cat’s whiskers are very sensitive and can be over-stimulated from the sides of bowls and it can affect their nervous system. This wide cat bowl solves that problem. A bonus is that the cat bowl is dishwasher and microwave safe. Cats prefer room temperature food, so being able to nuke refrigerated food for few seconds is handy. I am pleased with this order.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States March 8, 2024', 'is_verified': False}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Cute, I wish it was a set', 'author': 'Late Adopter', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'This is a cute bowl for cat food, and I like the bright yellow, anime character sort of style. I think it is shallow enough for most cats to avoid whisker stress, but perhaps not all. It looks a little out of place when not sold as a set of two, but the tilted design isn’t the best for water. I always hand wash pet bowls, and feel like the hollow base would collect a ton of water if put in the dishwasher. It is pretty lightweight, but I do wish they would have a solid base on the bottom instead of being completely hollow. It makes that much more difficult when rinsing, and takes longer to air dry. If this is your style, I do recommend it as it’s unique, but there’s a wide assortment to choose from out in the world that have matching styles for both food and water.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States March 3, 2024', 'is_verified': False}]"

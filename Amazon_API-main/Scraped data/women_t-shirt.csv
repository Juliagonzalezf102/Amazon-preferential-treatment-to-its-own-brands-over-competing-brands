It is simple and versatile, this is an excellent choice for various purposes, with a few considerations regarding its texture.Budget-Friendly Excellence:The standout feature of this t-shirt is its remarkable value for money. Priced at approximately $5, it offers an unbeatable combination of affordability and quality. I bought 5 of these t-shirts that lasted me through my college years and looked great paired with anything! I had to get rid of a few of them over time due to deodorant built up (not the t-shirt's fault, it took me a while to realize that the culprit was a stick deodorant that ruined most of my clothes before I switches to spray) that I was not able to get rid of. PRO TIP: a mixture of dish washer soap, baking soda and hydrogen peroxide takes care of this issue (and odor) within a few hours with no exception! Anyway, I ended up repurchasing these shirts a few times because of their price, comfort and versatility.Crafting Potential:The t-shirt's plain design lends itself well to creative projects. Whether you're into crafting or looking for a canvas for appliques, the Hanes Crewneck T-Shirt serves as a blank slate, allowing for personalized touches and artistic expressions. I personally never tried using this t-shirt for crafting opportunities but I figured for the price it might be a great option for crafts enthusiasts!Texture Consideration:While the t-shirt boasts various merits, one consideration is its texture. It may not be the softest option available, which could be a potential downside for those who prioritize a plush feel. However, it's well worth the money and I believe that the lack of softness and stretch helped extend the longevity of this shirt as it never got stretched out and the crewneck remained intact after many rounds of going through the washer and dryer and less than gentle handling!"", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 3, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Great T.', 'author': 'Rochelle', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'I am always on the lookout for a great red shirt.

Currently 195 lbs, due to pandemic inactivity, and cortisol/age weight. Pre-pandemic 135 lbs. I bought these for everyday WFH and sleep shirt. One really can\'t go wrong with Amazon Basics as far as price for a fairly decent quality material. It\'s exactly as the brand describes in it\'s name... Basic. The material is not too thin to the point of being poorly made, neither is it above average quality that will last years. My only reason for giving this particular v-neck shirt set 3 stars is because it\'s a slimmer/tighter fit in than other XL shirts and tank tops I\'ve purchased, where the XL is very loose and I feel I would have done better with a L for a loose but not too loose fit, or M for a more for fitting fit. The sleeves are very short, about 1.5 inch from inner armpit seam. Due to it being slimmer fitting I find myself constantly trying to pull it out from my pits where it bunches up. For me, personally, that\'s annoying. Otherwise, it gives way well enough around my bust (36B bra size), waist (size 12-16 depending on adeno/endometriosis bloating) and hips. The shirt falls below the hip and, surprisingly, covers my fupa, :D LOL (bloating or not)!

It's refreshing to have options beyond the standard neutrals, allowing me to inject a pop of color into my wardrobe. The variety makes it easy to mix and match with different outfits or layer under jackets and sweaters.The pricing of this shirt is also noteworthy. Considering the quality and comfort it offers, the cost is quite reasonable. It's a great value for money, especially given the durability it has demonstrated between washes. The fabric retains its shape and color even after multiple cycles, making it a reliable choice for long-term wear.If you're in search of a tight shirt that strikes the perfect balance between comfort, breathability, and style, all while being budget-friendly, I highly recommend checking out this option.

I have made several purchases of both long and short sleeve of these shirts and I love the softness and color options. My decision to go up one size made for a perfect proving to be a smart choice for me. It was not too tight as to be uncomfortable yet smooth and soft against my skin.I cut the tags on my LONG SLEEVE MINT GREEN shirt and cut so close that I have a small hole in that shirt. I’m considering replacing that particular item because the color, look and feel of the fabric suits me but not sure if further investment is deserving. I decided to CAREFULLY cut the tags on my other purchases and succeeded without causing damage.Clearly I plan on keeping my items BUT this is a caution with regards to the tags near the bottom of these tops.In these times of replacing large labeling that contain annoying stitching with other options, I’m perplexed that Abardsion would not have considered doing something better than this.One more thing to note is the items washing instructions are cold wash; no tumble dry. Because of the small hole in my mint green shirt, I decided to do a test with regular warm wash/cold rinse and tumble dry. The top came out beautifully.

At over 5\'10"", that works fairly well for me, though.I had read in some reviews that they were quite form-fitting, so I ordered an XL, which seemed to fit my measurements as well according to the chart. I guess they aren\'t hanging off me, but they are definitely on the loose side given that they are rib knit, and the shoulders are large, whereas I have a rather athletic build. Probably not a good choice for someone with a larger tummy, as I often find tops are tight in the shoulders and hang several inches behind me in the back. This style has perhaps an extra half inch in the shoulders and a half inch to an inch down the sides of my waist, so I assume (unless you want it figure-hugging, in which case you\'re fine, just buy a smaller size) that it is cut more for an athletic V or a straight-ish H figure.They have a nice thickness to them and the fabric looks good. I purchased black and royal blue, so I can\'t really speak to transparency; these dark shades are completely opaque! I love the blue. It\'s a gorgeous shade that brightens my face and yet is easy to wear. I\'m the sort of person who looks good in jewel tones, but I don\'t like huge contrasts and I don\'t feel comfortable in head-to-toe colour. The blue will work with both my print skirts and should look good with blue or black jeans without a screaming contrast.Before closing, I guess I should mention that there were no flaws, no threads hanging off. Another thing that may be of interest is that the V isn\'t very pointy. It\'s a little bit wide and doesn\'t come to a sharp point. I probably should have got a smaller size so my shoulders would have pulled it out and made the neck more open. It probably would have looked better, as it isn\'t very deep on me; I feel like perhaps the t shirt is meant to be pulled taut on the body, but that is not my case. Looks like good quality, though (I haven\'t washed it yet). And I do like the colours I chose.

In my mind, I was expecting low quality. I was proven wrong in a great way.I ordered a pair of the Slim Fit short sleeve women\'s V-Neck tees in black. I\'ve had some health problems and lost a substantial amount of weight, hence the need for some new shirts. Clothes shopping in person is an exercise in frustration. I have a long torso and equally long arms, so clothes are NEVER the right length. Plus I always feel ripped off- what I purchase NEVER holds up. And I launder CAREFULLY.Imagine my surprise when I tried on the tees, and they were LONG ENOUGH. Length is important! I live and work on a farm, and I NEED my shirts to be long. It prevents hay/feed/wood shavings from getting down the back of my pants. I also have a small market garden, and there is NOTHING more frustrating AND painful than sunburning your lower back because your shirt was too short to keep the sun off while tending crops. These shirts are the FIRST in ages that are ACTUALLY LONG ENOUGH. And I LOVE the slim fit, because they sit close to the body- no snagging them on gates/hooks, safer to wear around machinery. Major points right there.So the shirts fit great, and the fabric is substantial without being too heavy or too light (for me at least). The next concern I had was ""How are these going to wash up?"" So I washed them inside out in cold water on a regular cycle, and hung them to air dry. After drying, I inspected them carefully. No annoying pinholes, no seams let go, retained shape. Looking even better!Over the past few weeks, I\'ve washed and worn the tees MULTIPLE times a week. They\'re still fitting great, no fading, no weird pinholes, are retaining their shape. And I\'ve worn them in the fields, in the barn for chores, for MANUAL labor. And they\'re incredibly comfortable to boot! So I\'m REALLY starting to like these shirts!One last thing that sold me on these shirts: The last time I laundered both tees, I missed one coming out of the washer and accidentally ran it through the dryer on medium heat. When I realized what I\'d done, I was POSITIVE that the shirt that went through the dryer was going to have shrunk measurably. After the line-dried tee was completely dry, I laid them on top of one another, and compared them. ABSOLUTELY NO CHANGE. Not in size, color, shape, or texture of the fabric. (To be on the safe side, I plan to continue line drying these shirts because I like them so much and want them to last!)Final thoughts:You got me, Amazon. You hooked me in with a 2 pack of tees. I liked them SO much, that last week I ordered a 2 pack of white tees, and a 2 pack of blue/aqua tees. I now have enough shirts to make it through a week of work. And if most of the colors weren\'t sold out right now, I\'d buy more. But I don\'t like the available colors. I\'m really hoping they restock these and keep the cut/fit, because these could easily become my go-to tee.I also see that Amazon has a listing for a slim fit, LONG sleeve tee. It may be summer now, but Wisconsin winter is just around the corner. Those long sleeve tees look like JUST the thing to layer under insulated coveralls and a flannel for winter work. I will be keeping an eye on those, and if they come back in stock, I plan on grabbing a week\'s worth of those too!As always, I will update my review if anything changes with the product. I will probably update my review and note the date that they start to show signs of serious wear/weird holes/seams fail, just so other customers can get an idea of how long these shirts last for someone who\'s using them daily and heavily.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States June 28, 2021', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great, comfortable basic tees', 'author': 'MTC', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'If you need basic tee shirts for under sweaters, cardigans and just to wear with jeans, these are great.

I embarked on this purchase with a desire for comfortable and stylish workout tops, and I have been pleasantly rewarded with an array of T-shirts that have enhanced my exercise routine.Although the T-shirts have been a wonderful addition to my activewear collection, there is one minor issue that I’d like to address. I’ll share my comprehensive experience with these T-shirts, highlighting both the positive aspects and the minor drawback.👚🌈 Variety of Colors: From the moment I received my order, I was impressed with the range of vibrant and diverse colors. These tops have added a burst of color to my workouts, and their versatility means I can wear them casually, too. The rotating shades throughout the week add a dash of excitement to my attire, a small but welcome change from my usual monochrome workout gear.💦💪 Moisture-Wicking Material: One of the standout features of these T-shirts is their moisture-wicking properties. The fabric efficiently absorbs sweat, keeping me dry during high-intensity workouts. I was pleasantly surprised by how effectively these tops kept me comfortable and dry during long exercise sessions.📏👚 Accurate Sizing and Comfortable Fit: Finding activewear that fits well can be a challenge, but I was delighted with the accurate sizing and comfortable fit of these tops. They have just the right amount of stretch to allow freedom of movement without being too tight or loose. The V-neck design adds a subtle touch of style to the T-shirts and complements the overall look.✨👍 Versatility and Style: The versatility of these T-shirts is a significant advantage. I appreciate the ability to wear them during workouts and as casual tops. Their simple design pairs well with jeans or skirts, providing a stylish yet relaxed look. I love having activewear that easily transitions to casual wear without sacrificing style.💨🧘\u200d♀️ Breathable and Lightweight: I’m always on the lookout for activewear that feels light and breathable, and these tops exceeded my expectations. They’re perfect for yoga, running, and high-intensity workouts. I never feel overheated, which makes my workouts more enjoyable and focused.🌞👕 Minor Issue with Sunlight: Despite the many positives, there is a minor issue with sunlight. I noticed that the material becomes somewhat translucent in direct sunlight, which isn’t ideal for outdoor workouts on sunny days. It’s a small issue, but one worth mentioning for those who frequently exercise outdoors.Weighing all the factors, I give the Real Essentials Women’s Short Sleeve V-Neck Activewear T-Shirts a well-deserved 4-star rating 🌟🌟🌟🌟. The minor translucency in direct sunlight does not detract from the overall value of these T-shirts. The vibrant colors, moisture-wicking material, comfortable fit, and versatility make them a great addition to any activewear collection.To my fellow fitness enthusiasts and those in search of comfortable and versatile activewear, I wholeheartedly recommend these T-shirts. They offer both style and functionality, enhancing your workouts and casual wear. So go ahead and add a splash of color to your wardrobe and enjoy the comfort and flexibility of these Real Essentials tops.Thank you for taking the time to read my detailed review. I hope it helps you make an informed decision and brings you closer to finding the perfect activewear for your needs. Here’s to enjoyable workouts and comfortable casual outings with these T-shirts.

They’re comfortable, and they really are cool! I live in Florida, and I have to be outside several times a day to tend to my piggy. I have been delightfully surprised how much cooler these are than any of my regular shirts. And I got all black, by the way.The material is kind of on the thin side and doesn’t have the full opacity of a cotton tshirt. But it’s not sheer or see through; let’s say, it’s opacity is about 90% or something like that. So if you need that full opacity, the black (and maybe other darks?) might be okay; or you might want to just pass on these. (Holding fabric up to the light isn’t at all an accurate test of how it looks being worn, unless you plan on wearing a string of xmas lights underneath…)I’ve been wearing these shirts basically everyday for 5 1/2 months now, and their durability thus far is good. I have not had any issues with seams; nor with holes, snags, or runs. I use a front-loader, but if you use a top-loading washing machine, I suggest either washing on the gentle/delicate cycle, or put them in delicates/lingerie bags, just to be on the safe side, because agitators in top-loaders can be rough on clothes.Regarding sizing, I think this will depend on how you want the shirt to fit. Since so many reviewers said they run small, I first got the large, and it was larger than I was expecting based on the reviews. So I then got the medium, and I have to admit I was surprised it was only a little smaller than the large. The length is fairly similar; the shoulders and body of the medium are narrower by maybe a little less than an inch on each side (laying flat). At some point in the future I will probably get the small too.If you want it to be a little fitted while still being a little loose, then I suggest first just going with your normal size. If you want it to be more loose than fitted, go one size up. If you want it to be more like a classic tshirt fit but without the extra wide shoulders of regular “unisex” tshirts that are really just made for men’s bodies, then go two sizes up.So… is it flattering? Honestly, if this is something you care about, I think this is one of those types of things where you just have to get it and try it on and see how it looks on you. Because on some bodies, it will look nice; but for some people’s bodies, it just won’t work well for them (according to their preferences).Last point: I’m not sure, but they might have bled in the wash (at least the first time anyway), and that was with cold water. If you get dark colors, it’s probably a good idea to take precaution just in case.The material does dry fairly quickly, and it is polyester after all, so dry on low heat, or just hang if you prefer."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 11, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect T for me!', 'author': 'Lisa', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Thank you!!

First, I was looking for comfortable shirts. Then I was looking for fit. Then I was looking for thickness. In addition, I was looking specifically for inexpensive, quality shirts that would fit and be comfortable enough for me to SLEEP in.Sheerness first because that\'s what made me laugh. The first shirt I held up (lavender from what\'s currently listed as Set 1) was so sheer that I could see my entire living room through it. However, let me qualify my lol by stating that I was holding it up to a light because I was looking for cosmetic blemishes (I didn\'t find blemishes in any of the 5 shirts). That said, if you\'re going to be out and about during bright daylight, it will be somewhat see through. In addition if it fits you tightly around the bust or middle, it will be see through indoors as well. My concerns about sheerness had mostly to do with the fact that I\'d be braless in them.The fit is always hit or miss. I have to look through a ton of Reviews and Question/Answers before I decide whether to buy a S, M, or L. There were enough comments to convince me I\'d be safest ordering 1 size up for comfort. Even if the shirt turned out to be a bit large on me, that probably would be okay because it wasn\'t something I\'d be wearing out of the house. As long as I can keep the clothing item on my body, loose is most comfortable around the house for me. If I was going to wear these out, I\'d order a medium (I\'m 5\'3"" 135lbs mostly pear shaped). I\'m not large-breasted, so I probably wouldn\'t stretch out the shirt enough for my bra to show through it...on a cloudy day.Regarding comfort: I was looking for lightweight, and soft. Some might automatically go for a cotton blend, but I have other shirts of this blend (that are NOT see through), and I find them extremely comfortable to wear and simole to care for. They also don\'t wrinkle. These met my criteria in this category.For the price point when I bought them, it think the overall quality looks pretty good. There weren\'t loose threads on any of the seams or cuffs. In my experience, whether that holds up through laundering will have mostly to do with the quality of thread the manufacturer uses. I keep a simple sewing machine in my utility room, so I can do quick zigzags to help with further unraveling. For this price, I expect one or more of them will end up beneath the needle at some point; although, the thin fabric could deteriorate first.I\'m keeping them for the reasons I bought them, but I won\'t be wearing them without a bra if family or friends stop by for a quick visit. One turn sideways from a lamp, and the transparent silhouette of the girls would make my adult sons uncomfortable. I have cotton blends that will work better for those occasions. I do expect they will be very comfortable to sleep in.

Also, the heart itself is a much darker orange than in listing photos. In fact, in person it is even a little darker than my attached photos.THE T-SHIRTS IN GENERAL - I\'M A FAN.I already have about 8 of these crew & v-neck t-shirts from the last 2 or 3 years in plain white to wear alone or under clothing. I actually like these better than the Gap brand t-shirts I own. They have held up very well despite many, many wearings & washings. I wash & dry them w/ like colors in cold or eco warm water on either the perm press or gentle cycle depending on other items in load. I never noticed any shrinking so if they did shrink some it was minimal. They never wrinkle if hung or folded within a reasonable time after drying. They are very soft on the skin & not too thin or see-through. The fit of this shirt is flattering. They are a little clingy & form fitting on me but it may just b/c I am literally so curvy. I get the XXL which is my normal size but wish they sold a 3XL b/c sometimes I want a looser fit especially in the lighter colors. (Fyi - I am wearing a lounge bra in the photos so it would be more flattering with a proper bra holding my ladies up. It would also help if I stood up straight! Lol.) For reference my measurements are 46-38-56 & b/c of my high waist to hip ratio I am a hard fit. I am right there on the border between regular women\'s tops & plus size tops.LONG-SLEEVE VERSIONS -Everything I said above is referring to the short sleeve versions of these t-shirts. I do have a few of Amazon Essentials\' long-sleeve versions as well. One thing I find weird is that the ones I have bought w/ long-sleeves (white, grey & navy) seem slightly thinner & I find them to be a tighter fit. I don\'t wear any of my long-sleeve ones by themselves b/c I feel self-conscious. While they still feel comfortable on, they cling too tight in my gut & hip area making them unflattering. They make great undershirts, though, under sweaters & stuff. That being said, I recommend going up one size in the long-sleeve version. I wish I could...AMAZON ESSENTIALS\' PLUS SIZES -Yes, Amazon Essentials appears to offer plus sizes in a few of the t-shirt styles but in all the years I have been buying these I have NEVER seen any of the plus size shirts actually be available for purchase. They are always listed as either ""out of stock"" or just plain ""unavailable"". Bad luck on my part? Maybe. (Hey Amazon - Is it really that hard to keep these mass produced t-shirts in stock?

I am wearing one now and it fits perfectly. It is fitted but not tight or clingy in any way. The V-neck hits in a super flattering place. There is no visible cleavage on me. I love the length (I have a long torso and do not have any issues with my belly peaking out) and the fabric. The fabric is thin cotton that feels very high end. It is not see-thru in any way and is not overly stretchy like some of the designer T-shirts I have. It has just enough minimal stretch to allow it to move and flex with your body or to allow you to tie it up if you wish.

I have blended tees that fit through the body but the sleeves make my arms look like sausage stuffed into a small casing and they tend to sink into creases. I am 5\'3"", 230 lbs, bust measures 47"", waist 46 1/2"", hips 51"". I have broad shoulders and chubby arms. The circumference of the top of my arm measures 16 1/2"" and length from top of shoulder to elbow bend is7 1/2"". I normally wear a 3x or 2x sometimes. The 2 pictures on the left are the 4x I ordered after reading they run small. It was bigger than I would like and seemed like a true 4x. I washed it in cold water and dried on normal, hoping it would shrink a littles as some had complained they did. It did not shrink at all. I took a chance and ordered 3 in a 3x. hoping the sizing would be accurate. These fit the way I like and those are the 2 pics on the right. The sleeves are not too short or tight., the armholes fit normally and comfortably and the v neck is not too low for me. The cotton is soft. Some complained it is scratchy but mine are not at all. The length goes to the top of my thighs in front and bottom of my butt in back and the scoop hem is very slight as is the cut through the sides. The material does not stick in creases yet is not real thick. They should be comfortable in hot weather. I washed the 3 x\'s in cold water and dried on delicate just to be sure they didn\'t shrink. There was no shrinkage on these either. They all fit the same. I had gotten 2 more in the blue and 1 grey. The stitching and seams are good and the v neckline still laid flat after washing. The pictures posted are after the shirts were washed. You do need to get them out of the dryer right away or I am sure they will wrinkle a lot. Considering some of the reviews, I don\'t know if I just got lucky or if the mfg. has made quality changes but I am very happy with the shirts I got and they are true to my normal size.

I love a fitted shirt even with my chubs rolls. I am tall (5\'10"") with a long torso, so it was AWESOME to try these on and find that they are long enough on me- lower hip, almost to crotch. From shoulder to hem, it measures roughly 27.5"". Lays and looks totally natural. ALL of my t-shirts from just about everywhere are too short for my liking. These fit like they should on a tall person, especially those with added length in their torso. SO often I have to wear an extra long tank top under my t-shirts because they are never long enough. For once, I think I can just wear this t-shirt without the added layer if I want. The two colors I chose are not see through, and I would feel comfortable wearing them without a tank top underneath.It feels good, has a quality look and feel, and that makes me feel more put together compared so an ill fitting, misshapen cotton t-shirt that is typically offered in stores. How refreshing! I bought the black and the gray in 2xl, v-neck. I say they are true to size. I\'d say I am a size 20, which corresponds to the size chart for a 2xl in this product.

This is blouse is made from a very soft knit fabric with an appearance more of crepe, but without any of the stiffness I typically see in that fabric. The polyester 65%, viscose 30%, and elastane 5% fabric provides a silky soft feel coupled with stretch. The open weave on the shoulders provides a touch of elegance ( my grand daughters words) and will pretty much limit the wearing to warm Texas dawns.The round neck is high and modest.Overall it results in a more dressy look. The Viscose fiber component in the knit fabric provides the silky softness you will love but it also presents a weakness in water. Softening, shrinking, breaking filaments. Because of these traits you will want to use care in wearing and cleaning it. Light wash in cool water and air dry or very low heat tumble will help preserve the blouse so you can enjoy it for a looong time. This top is quite long in the body so it may be worn tucked or untucked as you desire. My granddaughter is about 5\'11"" to give you a perspective of size and fit on the Medium size.

The bottom hem comes down to just below my front hip bones so I can wear it tucked in or untucked. The shoulders are ""slouchy"" (??) so there\'s not a seam between the bodice and the arms. That means the fit doesn\'t have to be quite as exact. [I hope that makes sense. You can see it in the pictures.] The fit is right between tapered and loose. [Not quite tapered but not at all boxy.] I find this much more flattering. The sleeves are cuffed and stitched as shown so be aware of that if that\'s not something you like.I would order from this company again. :) [Also, I\'ve washed this three times. It\'s holding up beautifully and is still just as soft. There is no care tag on the garment but I seem to recall the tag that came with it had recommendations for cold water wash, low dry.

The color names do not always describe the actual colors of the shirts, but the photos of the colors are more accurate. For instance, the Darkbrown is actually a shade of Pumpkin, but while the name does not match, the color in the photo is more like it actually looks. I ordered a size XXL, which is the correct size per the size chart. The fit is very roomy and loose-fitting. An XL probably could have fit me if I wanted a more fitted look, as there is a nice stretch in the fabric. The fabric keeps its shape nicely even when stretched while putting the garment on, and it falls nicely without wrinkling. The fabric is very light without being “see-through”, and very soft on my skin. I like having a pocket on the shirt front as I have allergies and I use it to keep a tissue handy. The washing instructions say to wash it in warm water, not over 86 degrees F, which is Luke warm. I would not machine dry the garment except to use a cool “air” setting as I would be worried that the fabric may not hold up if it were dried using a warmer setting. The fabric, being so light, dries very quickly if allowed to just air dry. I love the way the fabric feels, that the Tee is roomy, but not sloppy, and that it comes in so many colors.

Didn't realize it was all polyester. I probably would have given it 5 stars if the fabric had been more of a cotton, t-shirt type fabric without the tiny holes (Pointelle) all over it. Overall, I think it's a really cute, unique top, though. Also, the neckline cuts a little lower than I like, but it can easily be adjusted with a string or ribbon by threading a couple of those lower grommets at the neckline."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 27, 2023', 'is_verified': True}]"

I like it when manufacturers shift clothing vacuum shrink-wrapped because that saves space in shipping and it puts the product to your door, clean and pristine. After you cut the top of the plastic bag, it slides off to expose the interior bagged shirt. The shirt is packaged with a hanging tag that says do not bleach, iron on low heat, tumble dry low, and machine wash and cool water, 30°C (or 86F), and the garment tag on the interior of the shirt has similar washing instructions, along with the extra caveat to wash dark colors separately. According to the garment tag, this shirt is constructed of 95% polyester and 5% spandex. With the spandex in the mix of the fabric, the fabric has a little bit of stretch to it. The stretchiness on this fabric goes left and right, but not up and down. The design on the fabric is printed cleanly and in a very pretty pattern. The shirt's interior is plain white fabric, the back of the painted section. The sleeves are made of a different material that is manufactured to be in a faux lace style. The outer edges of the sleeve are scalloped and designed with half rosettes. The top of the sleeve in the shoulder area is cut so that it puckers and gives a little bit of angle to allow better movement and to make the design a little more feminine. When wearing the shirt, the effect of the sleeve cut gives it kind of a squared-off shoulder appearance. The neckline is folded over and sewn similarly to the hemline on the bottom. It's a gentle v-neck cut to the neckline. The fabric and the main portion of the shirt are soft and comfortable, but the faux lace shoulders/ sleeves have no stretch to them and feel like starched linen against the skin. The sleeves are a light peach color that matches the design of the shirt well. On a 5'4 woman, the blouse comes down below the hips. We ordered large as that is her normal size. It is a comfortable fit, true to size, and not baggy or overly tight.

Looks every bit as amazing in person as it does on the model. The color is pretty true to what is seen on the model as well. I ordered two colors. The first color is a beautiful vibrant peachy pink color and the other is a very lovely shade of grey (it’s not a dull bland grey at all), both colors are beautiful! The semi puff/balloon sleeve with the ruffle edge gives this t-shirt top a little extra flair taking it up a notch. The elastic gathering is the perfect amount of cinch, I have larger upper arms so it’s not tight at all, and is very comfortable on the arm. The material is not too thin yet light enough and “breathable” making it great to wear even in the Florida heat. The material is also very soft and feels wonderful on the skin making it a top that can be worn all day and into the evening. I purchased a size XL and it fits wonderfully, it’s not tight but has a little flow to it. I like that the top is longer in length giving options to wear as it or tuck it in, as well as it’s long enough that if you want to cover your bum you can.

On me the XXL is a little larger but I did seem a little shrinkage when washing and drying.Great for wearing with shorts or jeans. Very comfortable and looks really nice, giving you the casual look. Great for lounging in or wearing for walking, shopping or whatever. Looks really nice on.Neckline around collar is comfortable and well made. It's short sleeve.My Opinion on the price, I think is really great, nice bargain for a nice comfortable t-shirt that is fun to wear. Looks really nice and feels great and comfortable.Highly Recommend because can be worn with anything.I also got the Plain White T-Shirt from this brand. It's the oversized type and I just love it. It has the rounded neckline and has short sleeves and on the ends of the sleeves they are rolled one time up.This shirt is so comfortable. This is my new go to shirt for wearing casual and don't know what else to wear. Washes up great and there was no shrinkage what so ever. It's so very soft. Seems to me to be a little oversized crop top that will go with absolutely anything. Can't wait for summer to wear it with shorts but for now I wear it with jeans and leggings.Highly Recommend and you can't be the price, real bargain."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 26, 2023', 'is_verified': False}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Cute and comfortable!', 'author': 'minnie3690', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I can't get enough of the Women's Oversized T-shirt Graphic Tees!

I have found it is my go to shirt for fall and winter. It is absolutely the most comfortable T-shirt I have. It is not binding but not slouchy. The material is so soft against my sensitive skin. It is long enough to go to the start of your legs almost. I ordered a color that wasn’t offered from Automet from Sherosa and it is going back. It was so tight in the arms, chest and stomach but so big in the hips. I couldn’t wait to get it off because I couldn’t breathe,lol. It felt that way anyway. I bought a cheap sport t-shirt at Walmart and knew why it was so cheap. Now I’m back here to order more of these because they are perfect for me. I’m retired so I don’t need to dress up anymore but this could be dressed up with another layer, sweater, blazer or just some simple accessories. I’m 64, 5’8, 143-146lbs. The Large is perfect for me but if your wanting it a little more form fitting then you might need a Medium but I wouldn’t go any smaller because I have a smaller frame. I ordered the gray and the cream to began with so now I’m thinking about the dark reddish and the coffee. I wish they would add a few more colors like a little darker gray, darker orange and a grayish purple which is the color I ordered from Sherosa but I wouldn’t even sleep in that one it was so uncomfortable.

I\'m 5\'3"" 150lbs 37"" bust and 29"" waist, and the Medium fits me really well, loose and comfy (if a bit long but I\'m used to that), but if you want the very oversized look in the product photos, definitely size up.

I\'m not always positive, but I try not to complain because it does nobody any good. Yes, I\'ve cried, screamed, thrown things. I\'ve wished and begged things to be better or never to have happened the way it did. But I still face the world with a smile and take things day by day. I figure I\'m on borrowed time considering my due date came and went. I\'ll try to enjoy what leftovers I get.Long story short, a going joke is that my life theme lately has been something along the lines of, ""I\'m okay, alright, fine. I\'m all good. Everything is great."" As if I\'m chanting it in the mirror every morning before tackling my day. With that in mind, I came across this shirt a couple weeks before a trip to a hospital further away with more knowledge about my situation and knew I had to order it. I wore it the day I went to the hospital for all the tests and evaluations. Made a few medical staff giggle about how appropriate the shirt was. It felt so very me, and it brought a smile on multiple people\'s faces, including my own. If I could have this shirt in multiple different colors I probably would.

Has a mild stretch to it making it very easy to tie up for versatile looks. Sleeves are more small & feminine but loose so they aren’t riding up into armpits which is nice. Neckline is larger than typical tees & has a “relaxed” look. I sized down for a more fitted look but it’s still a little loose on me but, I think this top is meant to be loose fitting which I’m really enjoying. I’d say order your usual size for a more relaxed/loose fit & a size down for a more fitted look. Color is accurate to stock photo, I was pleasantly surprised when I put it on & think the color looks great on me. I personally think this is a great top to dress up or wear casually because the material is thinner than regular tees making it easy to wear more dressy.

The elastic gathering is the perfect amount of cinch, I have larger upper arms so it’s not tight at all, and is very comfortable on the arm.

The material is also very soft and feels wonderful on the skin making it a top that can be worn all day and into the evening. I purchased a size XL and it fits wonderfully, it’s not tight but has a little flow to it.

I always wash in cold water & hang to dry. They\'ve held up well, although they are beginning to pill slightly. This is most apparent in the ""Lake Green"" color (which is really more of an ice blue). I use mostly the tide ""free and clear"" detergent; maybe I would have had less pilling w/woolite- I don\'t know. In any case, considering that I wear these shirts a LOT, and their low price, I don\'t mind replacing every year or two, and have just invested in a new stash. A note on sizing: the heathered peach color runs a LOT bigger than the others I bought (which were non-heathered colors), to the point that the XL looks sloppy on me. I don\'t know whether this is true of all the heathered colors, or whether the one I have is just a fluke. I can attest that the white is not see through at all. (there are 2 whites- I got the one w/the raglan sleeve) All in all, still my favorite, and still the most-worn shirts in my wardrobe // LOVE this shirt! Very flattering- The V-neck is low enough to show just a peek of cleavage w/out being ""too much. The slits at the side add a nice touch. Great fabric, nice weight- thin enough to be flattering w/out feeling flimsy. I ordered the ice blue color which is really cute and not see-through. (Don\'t know about the white yet- I have that on order & will report back). The raglan sleeve is also cute & means that if you are large busted like I am, you can get a size that\'s large enough w/out having to worry that the shoulder seams will be too low. I can usually wear a ""large"" in shirts that are loose-fitting. This time, I originally ordered a large and it was TINY and very clingy. The XL is just right. So I\'d advise that if you are looking for a relaxed fit as shown on the models, definitely size up, especially if you\'re busty or have a body that is over 40+. Haven\'t washed it yet- will report when I do. I wish it was made in the USA (and would even be happy to pay a little more for a shirt that was).

The third picture is the XL where there really isn\'t a lot of extra fabric in the waist, but it fits just right in the chest and waist. I wouldn\'t want it any tighter though. What I like about the XL is it still feels loose enough in the back so as not to show any back bulges. I have 3 different colors now.I\'ve washed and tumbled dried 3 of them so far, but inside out and in a laundry pouch so the fabric won\'t pill in the cycles.

However, budget is also more of a consideration now. I’m not gonna pay $80 for an at-home shirt.But basic good quality and construction still matters to me.Size: I’m 5’8” and a busty Size 14. I purchased the XL for an easy fit - even as I am losing weight. (Funny how that happens easier when you leave a stressful job, but I digress).Length: Definitely NOT long enough to wear with leggings if you are over the age of 30 and your butt doesn’t look like Margot Robbie.I first ordered the navy color to go with long skirts and flip flops or sneakers. Great top. Comfy easy fit. The sleeves are not a set-in sleeve. They are a dolman sleeve, so you don’t get that “pull” across the back. I’m also in Arizona, so the heat was a big consideration.It washed well in cold water - didn’t fade, but I also hang things to dry.I immediately bought 2 of the tropical print to go with cargo pants. I swear the prints do fit just a BIT smaller. It IS a different fabric than the solid - a jersey knit. (Time will tell if the garment was constructed correctly with ball-point needles. If not, little holes will appear at the seam lines after several washings. It’s an industry thing that is sometimes ignored.)The only thing I observe while new is that the top-stitching at the hem is basically a large basting stitch and I can see it letting go with wear over time.For the cost of the garment - I will mend if that happens.Travel: Ideal! One huge plus is that this will be a great versatile shirt for travel.

I love that it's long enough that it won't ride up and big enough (especially for a girl like me) that I can knot it in the front. The fact that it's not see through.... I could kiss the ground for that fact alone.Here's what I DON'T like:The color was off. I rarely read the color descriptions (my fault, I know) but the gray looked more seafoam to me and I was oh so excited about that. After reading other reviews I see this is a pretty common deception with this sweater.I pulled it out of the package wrinkled and inside out, so I know they didn't go through a ton of trouble to repackage it from the last person who bought it.Here's the problem with sweaters for big girls: they look nondescript. There's not enough definition and that makes a soft body look just flat out frumpy. Maybe that's more of a body perception ick but it's worth mentioning for my type of girls.It's not nearly as off the shoulder as it seems in the picture. Like my shoulders are begging for air and can't get it because I'm not as petite as the models they drape with two-sizes-too-big clothing.All in all, I think it's a nice sweater, but not a great one. The seller has counted on a number of simple deceptions to make their sales rather than advertising honestly and letting people decide for themselves. I'm thrilled to have found a big flowy sweater in my size, but at the cost, I don't know if it's worth keeping."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States March 2, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Nicer than I expected', 'author': 'Erin Van Belle', 'rating': 4, 'content': ""I ordered an XL it fits perfectly, I would have sized up though if I wanted a little more flow to it.

I ordered the blue with the boho looking large circular print. It looks fantastic on the model, of course, but not so flattering if you are a size 12. When opened, I noticed the material is polyester-ish stretch (I actually like that for the look of smoothness and ease of laundering). That said, the pattern/colors do NOT look at all like the photo -- it looks ... well ... polyester. I do NOT believe for one second that this is 90% cotton and 10% rayon -- it\'s SO stretchy and sleek - my skin detects NO cotton at all, feels poly/spandex. So I could still live with that since it\'s a nifty fresh pattern. Fit was further disappointment. Size XXL: for a size 12, 5\'4"" the shoulders and chest fit very nice, sleek, drapey, and not too tight or baggy. The problem that it is SO long, and tight through the hips (and over bum) that there\'s simply no way to make that look good on a size 12 in that material. Hugs my jeans so the outline of the back pockets and zipper show. So, tight from top of hips to under bum. I\'m not sending back - I like it so well, I\'m considering having it shortened by 3"" or maybe there\'s a way to tuck in and drape.

It superbly melds classic aesthetics with modern flair. The button-down feature harkens back to the timeless elegance of old-style Henley shirts, while its design and texture give it an updated, 2024 feel, exuding a sense of chic style and comfort. It's this delightful blend of the traditional and contemporary that compelled me to purchase an additional version of this shirt.The ribbed fabric contributes significantly to the shirt's overall appeal, offering a texture that's not just visually appealing but also comfortable against the skin. The fit and drape of the shirt are designed to flatter, making it a versatile piece that can easily transition from casual to more formal settings.However, it's worth noting a notable drawback – the shirt's length. While the shirt scores high on style and comfort, its shorter length may not be to everyone's liking or may limit its pairing options with certain types of bottoms.

I’d been wanted to ditch my non-stick cookware for several years for health reasons but couldn’t find the right fit. I’m spoiled by growing up cooking with only non-stick cookware. And I’m NOT a good cook so I tend to overheat pans & burn food. AND I sooo dislike cleaning up after cooking that I’d prefer to do it later (like the next day). I’m possibly the worst case scenario for testing any cookware line. I’d honestly much rather enjoy being served nice meals in restaurants. But, I’m immunocompromised so COVID changed all that. So, I’ve needed to up my game & learn to cook decently.I first tested several brands of stainless steel cookware. It was a total nightmare for me to clean. I then tried out ceramic cookware but found it to be too heavy for my arthritic joints. After reading about and researching Hestan’s Nanobond’s titanium coating, I thought it sounded promising & ordered this pan. Besides, the design of all of Hestan’s cookware is simply gorgeous.This Hestan Nanobond pan turned out to be AMAZING. My 1st test was fried eggs that turned out perfect with no sticking and easy cleanup afterwards. I’d read to heat the pan first, then add the oil/butter next & let it heat, and to then add the eggs. That definitely works to make the surface as close to being non-stick without actually having a non-stick coating. I’ve used it repeatedly for sticky foods like fried eggs, scrambled eggs, grilled cheese sandwiches, etc. with thrilling results. Best of all, it’s easy to clean afterwards.The Hestan Nanobond cookware is fantastic & suits my needs perfectly. I’ve now bought many more of the pots and pans in all shapes & sizes. I’m thrilled with the good looks & performance of the Nanobond line, the ease of cleaning up afterwards, and the titanium coating’s overall forgivingness for bad cooks. I accidentally added ground sausage needing to be browned for a casserole directly to their still-warming 3.5 quart sauté pan. The sausage stuck immediately to the bottom & I knew I’d really screwed up. While stirring the rest of the meat with only a silicon spatula, however, the stuck remnants surprisingly released completely from the bottom! I then decided to go ahead & try baking the entire casserole in the covered Nanobond pan in the oven instead of dirtying up a casserole dish. The casserole turned out fantastic with perfectly browned sides & bottom. The servings easily released from the pan without falling apart. And the very baked-on food remnants STILL cleaned up easily. The beautiful design of Hestan’s cookware really makes it equally appealing for stove/oven to table presentation.

I am hesitant to buy the larger skillets if they are going to be super thin like the 8 inch is.BOTTOM LINE:I think I’m going to love this pan for scrambled eggs, and I don’t know what else.. I plan to try a reverse sear with salmon or a hamburger.. I usually slow cook vegetables in an enameled cast iron sauce pan, so I don’t have to worry about salt and other seasonings leaching the SS.. But I suppose I will try some vegetables in the nano bond titanium (as a little browning is supposed to add a layer of flavor.. but I suspect browning anything is less healthy).STICK, OR NOT TO STICK?Mystery solved.. I was perplexed by so many reviews complaining about things sticking to the titanium nanobond, because my scrambled eggs were sliding around, almost like a nonstick pan. I just watched a video comparison of three different stainless steel pans.. The Heston nanobond, and demeyere (both of which I have cooked scrambled eggs on).. In the video they got the pans hot until the water drops danced around, which I think of it as a trick that allows you to cook scrambled eggs in cast-iron.. Plus they used what looked like some kind of vegetable oil.. And the egg was stuck in the pan bad.. I use butter at a low temperature (which I believe is appropriate for eggs), and the eggs don’t stick at all..LEACHING INTO FOODI’ve always heard that titanium is extremely non-reactive, but I have been UNABLE to find any information (other than manufacturers claims) whether titanium cookware will leach anything into food while cooking (ie: acidic foods, like tomato paste, or how it’s well known that salt will pit stainless steel).. Titanium is supposed to be completely safe for humans, so we can only hope if anything leeches it would be pure titanium (manufacturers tend to be untrustworthy, I can only hope in Italy they have tighter regulations for such things than in America).. If you search the Internet you can find where testing was done with SS pans.. Some manufacturers claim you can cook tomato red sauce in them (even though tomatoes do leech from SS)..SUPER THIN?When I say super thin, perhaps I’m spoiled by using expensive aluminum clad cookware from other brands that have a hefty amount of aluminum.. Because of the high price of Heston nano bond cookware, they should pop for thick enough aluminum layer to where we should have to wonder if it’s enough.. And to be clear I don’t know how thick the aluminum layer needs to be to do. It’s job..The thin-ness of the pan makes me wonder if it would be prone to warping (with my other stainless steel pans, I clean them while they are hot, but I am fearful to put water into these thin nano bond skillets).. NOTE: I don’t put a lot of cold water into a hot pan, rather a little bit that steam cleans most of the pan (none of my pans have ever warped).HEAT MOMENTUM:The other problem with extra thin aluminum cladding is heat momentum.. Heat momentum is one of the reasons cast-iron pans work so well for certain things (such as putting a frozen hamburger patty, and getting heat momentum to create the seer.. instead of the frozen patty immediately cooling off the pan which destroys the seer). In my particular case, using the control freak induction burner that has a built-in temperature probe, it will probably compensate by instantly turning the power up (which I hear it doing when I take a little off, to try to maintain temperature).. I doubt the thin aluminum will work in this instance, if you’re trying to cook a frozen steak or anything substantial without cool in the pan off..NON-STICK:I have not used nonstick pans for decades, but I have been cooking scrambled eggs in aluminum clad stainless steel pans for years.. And for the past year. I’ve been using Demeyere SS skillets, which have a treated SS surface that concentrates the chromium and nickel and removes the iron (it makes the stainless steel, more stainless steel, and it does stick less than regular SS, but not by much)..[Again contrary to what many reviews are saying], when I cooked scrambled eggs in the Heston nanobond it felt like nonstick to me. There was an obvious non-stick quality even compared to my demeyere). Like my demeyere pans, I expect I will have to occasionally use the special cleaner, or barkeepers friend, to get rid of the haze/seasoning that develops (this is expected)..Likewise cleanup was very easy (like I would imagine non-stick would be).TOO—LIGHT—WEIGHT?I know other reviews think it’s thick/heavy, but it is by far the lightest pan I have ever held in my hands (and I’ve used a few different brands of aluminum clad stainless steel pans).. I realize titanium is light weight, but the nano bond is a very thin layer of titanium (presumably over stainless steel)..The pan is so light weight that it’s causing the problem with my control, freak induction burner.. The 8” or will sit flat by itself, but because it’s so light weight, and the handle is relatively heavy, it will not sit flat on the induction burner for preheating, because there is a temperature probe in the center (that has a lightweight spring)..And (when cooking anything sensitive to uneven heat) you very much need to preheat pans on an induction burner, because the nature of induction heats the pan itself so there is always a hot ring in the center of the pan that matches the induction ring (preheating for a while lets the heat spread out)..BOTTOM LINE: I was able to preheat the pan to cook my scrambled eggs, but one end of the pan was about 1/8” off the induction burner (and induction burners are sensitive to this.I WOULD HATE: to try to preheat the 8” pan for a seer on this induction burner (the 1/8” in the air might end up a huge problem at high power settings)..COOKING TECHNIQUES:There is technique to consider in whether eggs or anything sticks or not..For scrambled eggs I use low heat (228F.. since my induction burner controls the temperature).. and I use plenty of butter (I am convinced, low carb is healthy, and butter and egg yolks are healthy fats).. my eggs were sliding around the pan like the nonstick advertisements..CLEANUP:My experience with cleanup was like you would imagine nonstick. But I’ve seen many reviews complain about food sticking to the pan (I can only assume they were using high heat, and maybe little or no oil).. I can’t say for sure, but I know with my other stainless steel pans anytime something sticks, I just put a squeeze of dish soap and a little water and come back in an hour (or the next morning).. If I’m in a hurry, I’ll turn on the burner for a few seconds so warm soap will work faster.. Then whatever was stuck on usually falls off.. Sometimes I use vinegar (I don’t know whether dish soap vinegar would be more effective)..', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 20, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Very high quality in ALMOST every area.', 'author': 'Teddy', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'Pros: the finish looks beautiful as it’s slightly a smoky grey color which is very smooth and though not nonstick is less sticky than other stainless steel pans I’ve used.

Mostly small nitpicks but for an expensive pan small can be big depending on your taste. Pricey. On my induction top at least the pan bottom warps very slightly so as thin coat of oil tends to pool towards the outer edges of the pan, this pretty common in a lot of pans but i do wish at this price it could be avoided. The handle feels high quality but could be slightly more comfortable if the part that rests against your palm was just a bit wider.Overall: If you can deal with those nitpicks this will make a great pan for small tasks like a grilled cheese or an omelet etc. and last a long time. happy cooking!', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 31, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent for searing', 'author': 'L.

I would rather it came with a glass lid, but since it didn’t I purchased that as well. Cooking on these ceramic pans is like a dream come true with nothing sticking and easy cleanup. Food slides around so easily that I can flip things like a professional chef. Somehow, breakfast tastes better when cooking in these pans. Perhaps because I’m not having to scrap it off the bottom of the pan. However...Upon receiving the pan(s) the first thing I did was season it along with my full set. It then went into the cupboard. Each pan with it’s own lid. It sat in there for a month. Although I have used all the pans in the full set I purchased, I have never used this particular pan, but please keep reading. My rules for my pans are: • Do not go above medium heat • Silicone and wooden utensils only • Hand wash only with sponge – no scouring pads - not even plastic ones • Let pans cool before washing • No nesting the pans • Season pans once a monthI season by coating the pan with oil. Place it in a 300 degree oven for two minutes. Let the pan cool and wipe out the remaining oil. I feel the little bit of time this task takes was well worth it to keep the pans non stick ceramic coating from degrading.I went so far as to post a notice on the exhaust fan above the stove listing the rules for family members. Imagine my dismay when I went to season my pans for the second time only to find a chip in the ceramic coating and gouges along the rim of this pan – even though the pan has just been sitting in the cupboard with the lid sitting on top of it. Is it possible that the lid caused the gouges? Hard to believe the pan could be so easily susceptible to damage, but there is no way the lid can cause the chip in the ceramic coating as the lid can’t touch that spot. Note that there is PLENTY of room in this cupboard so the pans are not packed in there stacked on top of each other. Is this pan really so vulnerable that it becomes damaged just sitting in the cupboard?I’ve examined my other ceramic pans and have found no damage so I’m hoping I simply received a defective 12 inch pan and have arranged to receive a replacement. Not wanting to risk potential damage on the rim of the new pan, I have also ordered a new lid with a silicone rim. It will protect the rim of the pan. This should be unnecessary as the pan should be able to tolerate putting a lid on it without causing damage. Chips in the ceramic coating is another story. We’ll see what happens.Putting aside my negative experience with this particular pan, they are all great to cook with. The only issue might be the handle. It’s metal, but it’s hollow. This allows heat to travel up the handle more quickly than a solid handle. I haven’t had any problems with the handle getting too hot as others have had, but I do notice that the closer the handle is to the pan then the hotter it is. Sure, that’s normal, but this gets hotter quicker. As I said, I have not yet hat an issue with the handle getting to hot to handle, but as a precaution I also purchased silicone handle holders that are used like pot holders. So far I’ve only used them when removing the pan from the oven after seasoning. I recommend the silicone handle holders – whatever style fits your fancy – as they provide a better, safer and less awkward grip than cloth pot holders.I love this (these) pans and am so disappointed that this one turned out not to be very durable, but hopefully the replacement will fair better.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 14, 2019', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Blue Diamond Skillet is terrific but…', 'author': 'Linda P.', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'I bought it as a used- new item to save a few bucks.

I had only been cooking in it about 2 months and always used wooden spoons) BUT...I digress.Cons: Only one handle, no secondary grip like my Anolon cookware. This was on me, because I didn\'t notice at the time of purchase; both lids of the 12"" and 10"" have dents in the metal rings, and you have to work them to make them fit the skillets. I don\'t know if this is by design (it almost looks that way but not sure what purpose that would serve) or maybe this is a result of production defects, etc. As I stated above, both skillets and lids were very well packaged. Now that I think of it...maybe I just don\'t know how to maneuver the lids.

I do think the frying pan was beautiful, weighted nicely in the hand quite sturdy. I do hope I can find a solution to the staining on the side. All in all, I would say buy these but treat them with some amount of care. I wish thank the Carote company for reaching out.Namaste ppl!Where are all these great reviews coming from? I was so delighted when I recieved this frying pan but that didn\'t last long. First trial was the omelet test. Perfect, slid right out of the pan. Next was straight up fried eggs. Meh. They didn\'t slide around as the omelet. I had to use a spatula. Nothing in the description alerted the buyer that plastic/silicon were needed. As you can see from my photo after 6 uses the pan looks like it\'s been used for years. Not only that but steam from the lid slid down the outside of the pan. This happened often with my old frying pans but a little scubbing and usually came off with a bit of elbow. Not the Carote. Nope nope. Absolutely nothing worked. I use Dawn Professional and a Dobie pad. Both work extremely well on my everyday dishwasher. Truthfully, I was going to try bleach but I thought pffffft if I have use bleach the stain wasn\'t worth the effort. I often read these reviews and wonder if buyers have contacted the product company. I filed a complaint via Prime when I answered the ""how was your experience with this seller?"" Replied with the same information I\'ve given here. One would think the seller would have contacted me after such an unhappy customer. It\'s been more than a few days. I keep checking my Amazon messages and my account email. LOL and, yes, I\'ve checked the spam folder. Nada. Too bad for them. If I had at least an apology I might invested in some new cooking tools and purchased additional Carote cookware. I\'m still thinking about doing those things but I just don\'t know.

Excellent Non-Stick Titanium Ceramic Frying Pans!', 'author': 'Vinny P.', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Quick Update, as of March 26, 2017:It is now almost 10 months since I ordered these pans. After having owned these pans for over 9 months now, I can say that the two pans are still performing so well that if I could give this product ten (10) stars instead of the maximum 5 stars currently allowed by Amazon, I would do so.Perhaps the strangest thing about these two pans is that starting about a month after I had first purchased them, everyone in the house -- including even our overnight visitors -- stopped using all of the other frying pans in the house (most of them well-conditioned cast iron pans, and also one teflon-coated pan) and also ceased using stainless steel pots to quickly heat food or to reheat leftover meals from the fridge, and instead switched to solely using these two pans, simply because nothing ever sticks to them (ever see how badly egg and cheese omelet leftovers stick to a stainless steel pot if you try to use if for reheating them? ... it is quite gross, whereas if you put that same food in one of these ceramic coated pans, it reheats quickly with ZERO sticking!).So, I, along with everyone else in my house, love these pans more than ever now that we have been using them each many times per day for nearly a year!Simply amazing pans! They are truly nonstick!My Original ReviewI purchased two of these Gotham Steel non-stick titanium ceramic frying pans, one in the 9.5"" diameter size and one in the 12.5"" diameter size, a few weeks ago. I am a trained scientist and engineer, and thus i am not easily amazed by consumer kitchenware products that claim to be non-stick. However, I am amazed by the performance of these pans after 3.5 weeks of having used them daily.I want to briefly mention that I was an early adapter/user of the so-called non-stick ceramic frying pan technology back around 2010 when the very first generation of ""non-stick"" ceramic frying pans hit the market. I bought one of those early first-generation products back in late 2010 -- it was a ""Green"" brand frying pan bearing a so-called ""green"" so-called non-stick ceramic surface. That pan turned out to be horrible from the very first use; everything stuck to it, and when I complained to the ""Green"" manufacturer,, they acknowledged the problem, and advised that I condition the pan, using hot oil and an oven, in the same fashion that a cast iron pan is conditioned, to try to make it more non-stick, Needless to say, I immediately abandoned that first-generation ""non-stick"" ceramic frying pan, and resolved to wait at least 5 to 6 years before purchasing another non-stick ceramic pan so that the ceramic technology could mature over the years.Indeed, my purchase of the two Gotham Steel pans in late July of 2016, about 4 weeks ago, came about only because I was convinced, after having done some careful research on the web, that the non-stick ceramic frying pan technology had matured greatly over the past 6 years. It is my impression that the non-stick ceramic pans currently on the market -- including the Gotham Steel titanium ceramic pans -- are using approximately sixth-generation non-stick ceramic technology, and it appeared from my research that this latter-generation non-stick ceramic technology was far better than the first-generation product that I had tried back in 2010..Each of these pans has seen use multiple times per day since they arrived here about 3+ weeks ago, and they are still performing perfectly. Nothing ever sticks to the pan surface to any noticeable degree, and post-cooking cleanup of the pans takes just a few seconds, because nothing ever sticks. I am quite amazed at the performance of these two pans.Incidentally, I regularly use sharp-edged metal utensils in these pans, including using a steak knife to slice Italian sausages while in the pan, and neither of the pans shows even the faintest scratch marks!My only cautionary note, if you are considering purchasing one of these fine pans, is that it is very important to never allow the temperature of the cooking surface on the bottom of the pan to exceed 500 degrees F; this upper temperature limit is also firmly and clearly noted in the product information provided with the pan by the manufacturer. It is also very important to never allow cooked foods to dry out and burn onto the pan surface, nor to allow cooked foods to dry and harden on the pan.For full transparency, I want to disclose that I purchased each of these two Gotham Steel pans at their full listed price on Amazon Prime Marketplace.

I\'ve had enough with my pans and began research on cookeware sets. I will note here that my current cookware is the high end non-stick, with my fry pans being those bought after watching some fool on TV melt candy in a wrapper in the pan and then wiping it clean. (These pans by the way are only 8 months old and are already WARPED). For new cookware, my ONE main requirement was that they were or would be NON-WARPING. The second requirement was that they be non-stick. After some research I settled on the 14 piece of T-Fal non-stick / non-warp set. Item came well packaged and unpacking the items I was impressed with the feel of each piece: not too heavy or light even with a lid. I also noted the non-stick interior surface and the very nice looking anodized exterior. Very nice touch with the vented lids (an actual hole in the glass) and the FULL insulation of the handles. Now I mention this insulation because I have (had) cookware items that had decorative (?) metal ends on the handles that would occasionally get very warm while being used.( Nothing like grabbing a pot or pan handle that want to cook your hand medium rare.) I washed each piece and WITHOUT SEASONING, took the largest frying pan, placed it on the range on MED HEAT (about 5-6 on an electric glass top range) and let it heat up. After 2-3 minutes, I noted that the T-FAL center emblem in the pan really didn\'t look like it changed much. I expected it to go from the T-FAL logo to a full red dot. Didn\'t happen but it was no biggie as in the past several months I began preheating my fry pans for about 3 minutes due to their warped exterior. Next I added magarine as I was going to cook sunnyside up eggs. I was impressed to note that the margarine melted quickly AND when spread about the pan, little bubbles began to show up over the ENTIRE pan surface. This meant that the pan was heating up evenly. In went the eggs and after placing a lid on the pan I turned away to get something off the counter. Now, with my older warped fry pans I could do this same act, return to the range and begin to slowly rotate the pan to get even heating on the eggs. Not so with this T-Fal fry pan. I noted the whites turning opaque quickly and the yolks getting their whitish color meaning they would be just slightly runny. In short, these eggs came out perfect and in well over 1/2 the time from my old cookware. Even my other half was impressed. Now my next ""adventures in cooking"" will involve sautéing, making my alfredo sauce, grilling (this set came with a VERY NICE grill pan!) and frying. So far I am following the instructions by keeping the range heat at MED or just a bit more. Noted is that one foray into frying eggs does not provide enough experience with this cookware to turn cartwheels in the kitchen. But so far, with eggs being one of my more difficult items to make because of my other warped pans with uneven heat, this T-Fal pan is impressive. So, my rating of 4 is tentative as I will update this review within a short time after I try other pieces of this set.UPDATE:First this disclaimer: I HAVE NOT and AM NOT an employee of T-Fal or Amazon, and I have NOT been hired to write a raving review. That said, now for the update. I have had this set now for over a month and have used all but one of the pans. The total experience has been incredible. I cook out of self-defense (the other half is banned by the EPA from boiling water) and am pretty fast in the kitchen when I am cooking.- WEIGHT OF PANS: I thought the pans were a bit on the light side until I started using them. Whether it was thought of during design or not, the pans are heavy enough to withstand various cooking requirements but light enough where you don\'t break your wrist when lifting.- NON STICK SURFACE: Come on now! Who in their right mind melts plastic spoons or uses an electric beater on their non-stick cookware! I believe surface of this T-Fal would take this abuse with no problem, but I happen to like my food without the taste of plastic. I\'ve used nearly all the pans and found them all to be amazingly non-stick as well as sturdy. I still use butter/olive oil when sautéing or frying. I have had nothing stick to the pans nor have any of these pans lost any of their non-stick capability.- HEATING: This is the BEST part of this cookware. If you cook/have cooked with slightly warped cookware, you know the problem with hot heat spots or very little heat at all. Thus, you have to move the pan around a bit to get yours items cooked. Each of the pans in this T-Fal set has VERY even heat distribution. There is a ""plate"" on the bottom of the pans that distributes the heat evenly. I have found that because of this, I\'ve noted shorter cooking times on various items AND I now cook on a lower heat settings NOTE: This T-Fal cookware set will cause you to change how your cook and for how long. The even heat distribution is stunning. ALSO, I do preheat my pans (except for boiling water) and use only wooden or high heat tolerant silicone utensils..- STORAGE OF THE COOKWARE: I don\'t stack this cookware. Instead I hang it up. This simply helps prolong the life of my investment.Overall, I am very impressed with this cookware. Even my other half (known for making ANGRY little pellets called hamburgers), has begun to learn that this cookware can even make her a decent cook. And yes, I bit on the late night adverts showing the frying pans melting plastic spoons and candy in wrappers and magically not sticking. I bought 3. Within 90 days they either lost their non-stick capability, began to warp, or both.Some people are gourmet cooks; others have trouble boiling water. This cookware will holdup very well and serve both very well. My motto is that you get what you pay for. And you WILL get more than you\'ve paid for this set.

The weight and thickness of the cookware is excellent, they truly feel durable and sturdy in every way. I discovered this line from T-Fal about 7 years ago and I honestly would rather buy their sets than Wolfgang Puck, Martha Stewart, or whatever fad brand of nonstick comes along next season.NOTE: these pans will tolerate softer wood utensils like Bamboo, but you should always use silicone or plastic when possible.

Rader Jr.', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I\'m doing an initial review of this cookware set. As it\'s being used, my intention is to come back to this review with updates.I ordered this set after doing a bit of \'googling\' on what is the best cookware set for 2019 - I wanted something for our gas range. I think it\'s something to take into consideration when choosing what you\'re going to buy. An example - on a gas range - if the setting is high and your cookware has some sort of enamel-like finish, and the flames are coming over the sides of the pot/pan - it\'s going to discolor the finish after a period of time.I looked at the top 10 bracket, the top 5 bracket, I went to reviews, Good Housekeeping, Consumer Reports, just to name two of several, and surprisingly (at least for me) T-Fal was a set that kept popping up as one of the best. I\'ve always thought of T-Fal as one of those starter cookware sets that someone might purchase when they\'re moving into their first apartment and starting out on their own - it is/was inexpensive - a set for a person learning to cook and therefore not requiring something more \'higher-end.\' If you have/had those thoughts as well, you might want to set them aside, at least with this set..Upon pulling everything out of the box my first impression was they look really nice. The set is light weight - the handles are riveted, silicone encased and can withstand up to 400 degree oven temperature. The lids are heavy tempered glass, each one having a small vent hole, and the handles are also silicone encased as well. The design of the lid-handles seems to take into account the use of pot holders since there\'s substantial space between the glass and the handle itself. All of the lids in my set fit nicely onto their respective pot/pan - no warpage or bent rims. The pots/pans are dishwasher safe (mine aren\'t going to see the inside of a dishwasher), and this particular set you can use metal utensils (I personally ain\'t-a-gonna do it). It comes with a steamer that is designed to stack on top of the large pot (not the dutch oven). When you\'re done steaming, grab some pot holders and lift the insert out by it\'s handles - no muss, no fuss. It\'s a much better option than the collapsible steamer I currently using.It comes with instructions on how to care for your cookware. READ THE INSTRUCTIONS! Why you may ask? This set is replacing a Calphalon set, and yes Calphalon was/is rated highly as well. But why replace it? Because being the knuckle head that I am, I didn\'t read the instructions. I knew Calphalon had to be hand washed (at least the set that I own) - but what I didn\'t know was what high heat does to the pots. When you read the instructions for T-Fal, and because it\'s aluminum, it\'ll say something to the effect of using low to medium heat (because aluminum conducts heat really well). See … I didn\'t know that about anodized aluminum and what I ended up doing was burning the finish off of each pot and skillet bottom of my Calphalon set - right down to the bare aluminum and of course this affected the non-stick surface on the inside. So please, read and follow the instructions. One other thing before I wrap this up. When I was doing my \'research\' I came across this one video of an owner showing how an empty T-Fal pot didn\'t sit level on her stove. Seems the handle was heavy enough that it caused the pot to tip. She said this was a problem - and I guess it could be if you\'re in the process of putting something inside the pot in preparation of cooking. I do get that - but I placed an empty pot on the stove, centered over the burner, and it sat just fine - although I\'ll say my stove grate is different than the stove in the video - it also sat level on the counter top. Perhaps this might be something to take into consideration???So initial impression is the set seems to be of good quality, looks nice, and I\'m looking forward to putting this set through it\'s paces.UPDATE:As of December 4, 2019 I have to say that the T-Fal set has held up extremely well - cooking with this set is a breeze. I keep the burner setting usually at med-high if I want to bring something to a boil - and it doesn\'t take long for that to happen. The pots and pans conduct heat really well and there\'s practically no sticking. Usually I can pretty-much rinse off any food residue left behind using just running hot water. I\'m pretty good at using either wooden or silicon-type utensils when cooking, though on occasion I\'ve used metal spoons to stir, and there are no marks inside any of the pots/pans. I\'m not one of those cooks adept enough to shift a pan around and flip the contents briefly into the air (my cool-factor is not that high) so ""skating"" the bottom of a pot/pan over the cast-iron grate has not taken place, so I can\'t say what would happen to this set if I were to do so. If I were to hazard a guess, I would say that more than likely there would be some marring of the bottom since cast iron probably trumps aluminum. Overall I\'m very please with this purchase and the performance of this cook set.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States April 9, 2019', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Love this set.

Absolutely no need to crank that burner up to HIGH.Nothing sticks to the pan, super easy to clean. I refuse to put these in the dishwasher. I've threatened bodily harm to anyone in my household that tries to cook on high heat or stick these in the dishwasher. Cooking is a joy again."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 5, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Superb Cookware', 'author': 'revkenq', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I wanted to wait at least a couple after my initial purchase to write a review, since writing an immediate review offers little information as to the durability of the product. I purchased my first T-Fal set of pots and pans nearly 45 years ago, and never regretted the decision, just as I\'ve not regretted this one. After several months of use, the pots and pans looks as they did when I purchased them, no discoloring, and no scratches. The only thing that is slightly affected is the bottom of the pans where they are frequently slid back and forth over the stove top burner. Of course, this poses no problem for me, as I\'m not concerned about the bottom, and as stated, it\'s only slightly affected.One of the things that I really like about this set is the ""weight"" of them. They aren\'t lightest pots and pans, neither are they the heaviest. They are in fact, about medium weight and thickness. I suppose you could say they are in the ""Goldie Locks"" zone, in other words, the weight and thickness are ""just right.""As I am not always careful about storing my pots and pans, I decided with this set to purchase some pot and pans dividers/protectors which can be cut to size and placed on the inside surface of the pans to keep them from coming into contact with the other pots and pans, thus preventing accidental scratching, especially, if one tends to ""toss"" them into the cupboard, instead of gently laying them down.Everything about this T-Fal set is by and large ""pros."" However, there is one slight ""con,"" and that is because of the way the bottom of the set is designed for optimum heat distribution, they are prone to sliding around on the stove top. This problem is solved easily enough by just holding onto the handle when stirring anything. It might seem like a small nuisance, but like anything, doing frequently, it will become a habit, and you will doing it without thinking about it. Actually, I would think this would be the safest way to stir things on the stove even if they didn\'t tend to slide a little.With this set, I did take the time to read quite a few of the reviews, and I was impressed to say the least. One video review showed a customer who had bought this same set about five years before, as well as the same set recently. I was quite impressed with the five-year old set as it looked brand new, except with a little wear on the bottom.Oh yes, there is one more ""con,"" sort of, and that is there aren\'t lids for every pot and pans, in fact, there about half as many lids and there are pots and pans, although, each lid fit two pots or pans. So, if it were possible, I would purchase lids for all of them, despite the fact that it really isn\'t necessary seeing as most people only have four burners on their stove, and foods that had already been cooked would most likely have been placed into bowls. But, what if I didn\'t want to place it in a bowl, and wanted to set the whole thing aside with the lid on it? But alas, me thinks I will survive this great disadvantage.Obviously, a person could spend a lot more money on a set of pots and pans, but for everyday cooking, I don\'t think you could purchase a better set, at least, not for the money.

I have replaced most of these pans with Hex Clad because of the hybrid characteristics (weight + non stick) of Hex Clad. After 4 years, these T-Fal are still better non-stick than the new hex-clad but I can use Hex Clad for all stainless / most non-stick purposes.Obviously the price point on Hex Clad is entirely different, this isn't meant to recomend Hex Clad over T-Fal, they both have their place! I still use a few of the T-Fal when I need something really really non-stick, I passed the rest of these pans to my adult children who are using them very happily. I would not hesitate to recomend these!UPDATEAfter a little less than 1 year of use the review remains largely unchanged. The only thing I would say is that the square gridles warped slightly early on. I use a gas range, and the warp is not bad enough to impact my use, but if these were used on a glass cooktop I expect that the griddles would be nearly unusable. The finish has not scratched or flaked or diminished in any way that I can perceive, I do NOT use metal utensils, and I always hand-wash. Some of the other reviews show pictures of the bottom of the pan with the finish rubbed off, I have not experienced this.I have two large T-fal frying pans I purchased from Costco, that I like very much. I had a set of Kirkland non-stick and a set of Circulon non-stick that I have had for about 12 years and 15 years respectively. I bought two of these sets to replace the two sets above. I thought that these pan sets were the same as the frying pans I bought at Costco based on the appearance in the picture. I have not rated these pans for scratch resistance because I have only had them for a few weeks. If they are as good as the T-Fal from Costco I expect they will do well, but I can't rate them yet.About 80% of the time I use cast iron or stainless steel. The good thing about those materials are heat retention and being able to handle high heat, both are not strong suits of most non-stick. Of course you can't use cast iron for acidic foods and stainless is tricky and you must use oil correctly to stop sticking, but both are very good for creating proper textures on food that need 'crusts' like steak, hash browns, grilled sandwiches, etc. Not related to this review, but if you like to cook, and haven't already, learn to use cast iron and stainless and get good products of each (copper inside of stainless for heat distribution).I use non-stick for things where non stick is important (like eggs) or when other characteristics, like heat retention, don't matter like Kraft mac and cheese (don't judge me), frozen corn/peas, warming bottled sauces and similar.The observations below are based on about 3 weeks of use. Some things that may appear 'negative' are generally assumptions on my part, and not misrepresentations in the listing.Things to know1- If you bought similar T-fal frying pans at Costco as I did, those pans are considerably heavier than the pans in this set, so heat retention in those pans are far better than in the pans in this set.2- I really like that the rivets are now teflon coated, this makes cleaning much easier. I mention the T-fal pans above that I purchased from Costco, I believe that they have the same coating, and I have had those pans for well over a year, and they clean VERY easily, better than either the Kirkland or the Circulon.3- These pans seem to distribute heat very well, but as soon as food hits the pan the, the lack of weight results in the pan cooling where the food is. This is why I rated heat distribution a 4 instead of a 5, and really is more of something to learn and understand than a negative.4- These pans seem to heat and boil water much faster than the two sets I mention above. This may be because of the heat distribution and the fact that not much energy is required to heat the pans themselves - just speculation on my part.5- Although I used Circulon for a long time, I find the ridges a negative in terms of non-stick performance anytime after the first few uses. Also, the ridges actually create inconsistent cooking in some uses, for instance, when cooking pancakes, you can actually see the ridge pattern in the pancakes instead of a consistent cook. Obviously the pans in this listing do not suffer from this as they have smooth surfaces.6- This set does not have a tall pan that I would call a 'stock pot'. Both of the sets that I mention above had a 8 to 10 quart tall pan that I will look to replace.7- The kirkland set had metal handles, so they could be placed in the oven without worrying. Although I think that the rubber handles on this set are rated up to some temperature, I still am not comfortable placing these in the oven. I knew I would loose this when I purchased these, and since I rarely use non-stick in the over, I wasn't too worried about it, but somethign to consider.8- If you hang your pans from a pot-rack, like I do, the handles are large, and the pans don't fit inside of each other really well. With the kirkland I could easily share one hook for two pans because the size and shape of the handles allowed for them to 'nest' on one hook, and the size of the pans, and length of the handles, allowed them to fit into each other well when hanging. Don't expect to be able to do this with these pans.9- This set does not have a large frying pan. I knew this and it didn't bother me because of the previously mentioned pans from Costco, but be aware that the size of the pans in this set are all relatively small.10- I would prefer that these pans be slightly heavier, but that is probably a subjective desire based on my experience and once I learn to account for the lack of weight in my cooking practices it will probably be OK.Overall I am mostly happy with the pans, and for what they are, they are very effective. I would probably not be happy with them as my only set of cookware because of the inability to put them in the oven and they characteristics I described based on the pan weight. If those things don't matter to you, I would rate these a 5."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 2, 2020', 'is_verified': True}]"

However, I've discovered that by using a tiny drop of oil (light olive oil - not virgin), and I mean little (not more than 1/4 teaspoon is needed), no crispy film develops.I don't use EVOO with the pans. I've read some reviews which say it may stain the pan. I've had no problems using light olive oil.I also tried frying chicken with the larger pan yesterday and stir frying vegetables.It was okay! I (only dared) used medium heat only so it took much longer to cook than using my wok.My wok sticks easily when I cook chicken with it, but for this first use, I loved that it didn't stick with this pan at all!I unfortunately slightly overcooked the chicken, but found it still did not stick to the pan - yay!As it's not long since I've been using the pans, it will be interesting to see how long these favorable comments last!I do make sure I don't use EVOO or metal utensils, use low-medium heat only and I make sure I let pan cool before cleaning.Another tip I read and found useful was to use kitchen paper to wipe both sides of the pans after use and any unwanted dirt or marks come off so easily.

I needed a new 10” pan after using mine for 8 years, saw the soft grip handle option here, and had to try it. I really like the feel of the handle as I’m cooking. I won’t lie, I’ve destroyed a few pans learning how to use them. Here is what I learned. First mistake, don’t use high heat with them. This lesson was hard to learn. It really doesn’t take a lot of heat to make these pans hot. Just above medium on my stove is enough to make it hot enough to fry with. If you go to a medium high or high heat on your stove, you will burn your food and ruin your pan. Stick to a low or medium heat. I also think the folks who were complaining of the handles melting were cooking on a high heat. Second mistake, don’t use any spray oils in the pan. Spray on oils like Pam will coat your skillet in an oil that will permanently stick to the ceramic, stain your pan, and destroy the natural non stick surface. Use regular oils like butter, olive oil, coconut oil or vegetable oil. Plus, just a tiny bit of oil will go a long way with the natural non-stick qualities of ceramic pans. If you over do the oil on too high a heat, you will destroy your pans. Third mistake, using metal tools on the skillet. I beat the hell out of my first skillet using a metal spatula. I switched to olive wood and bamboo tools, and they do great. They don’t scratch the surface at all. Fourth mistake, running water in the skillet while it is still hot. I ruined the surface by repeatedly doing that. I was thinking I needed to put it to soak, but learned that if I just let it cool, the food came right off when I washed it with a sponge and soap. I don’t have a dishwasher to know if that is good to do or not. Mine have always been hand washed. Are these pans going to last you the rest of your life?

It is speckled and unique-looking. The faux wood handle is cool though evidently fake. I like that there are very few seams and nook/crannies that collect food debris, burnt stuff that makes it hard to clean. As noted in the description, the pan walls do not have rivets for the handle which makes cleaning this pan much more enjoyable. No more burnt schmutz around the rivet getting brown and nasty. The non-stick works well, I cannot complain about it. I like to turn my flame up to medium -high to almost high and it has held up without turning color on the cooking surface. It also has not gotten tacky/sticky from high heat use so far. Only time will tell. I will report back if it gets bad.We use the pan for stir-frying, making bacon, warming tortillas, pretty much everything. Nothing has stuck and it hasn't turned color. After much cooking in it, I will occasionally fry an egg without oil and it still comes out without sticking, though nothing makes things crisp up like a little oil in the pan. It seems to handle everything like a champ. It can go into the oven with moderate temps in the 300Fs. I haven't tried that yet, however. The lid fits well and works nicely. It has a round knob that screws into the lid so you do have to contend with the occasional loosening screw. I do prefer the metal U-shaped handles because of that. The drawback of the u-shaped handle is that you cannot lay the lid flat on its back like you can with the flat top round handle that comes with this one. It's personal preference.The pan is also lighter than my cast iron (as most pans will be) and we tend to use this more for everyday cooking though for searing meats and hamburgers, nothing beats the infernal heat you can inflict upon a cast iron pan.Overall, the pan seems much more high quality and unique than some of the common non-sticks out there. We are pretty rough with our cookware since they are used a great deal, so I will report back in a little while. It's a nice versatile pan for almost all of your cooking.

New cast should be brought up to temp gradually to avoid warping or breakage. If not thoroughly dried (towel then heat), moisture will creep through the seasoning and rust will appear--it is iron.I bought this as a filler set, small pans to fill in for the larger skillets. In the photo, the skillet on the right is the 10"" from the set. On the left is an actual 10"" skillet 30+ years old, complete with ""10"" clearly marked in the handle. By today\'s standards, it would be a 12"".While using dish soap is OK with some and taboo with others, I\'m with the no soap crowd since dish soap is a degreaser, which softens the seasoning, which can also lead to rust spots from the moisture in the air. Instead, I clean my pans with baking soda as it not only cleans the pan, it removes left over odors, such as fish, then hand dry before putting it on the stove to heat through. If you want your cast iron to be non-stick, never use metal utensils as it scratches the seasoning the same as it would any non-stick pots or pans.Any oil is good for daily use, but once or twice a week (depending on use) I recommend using Crisbee Rub, which contains beeswax, for an ultra smooth surface.

Fabulous!', 'author': 'LeighLeiben', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I bought these as a Christmas Gift for my boyfriend (we live together) because he wanted to replace our very beaten up old skillet. I checked around a lot whether or not these were worth the price vs the cheaper T-Fal sets that come in fun colors and are about half the price and decided that the added features on this set worth it.I\'m glad I wasn\'t disappointed. The hard, anodized coating is really what convinced me of the upgrade. After all....the durability of the pans is what makes us need to buy new ones every few years or alternatively keep them around much longer for a slightly higher price. These wipe clean as promised and require no butter or oil to be ""non-stick"". We haven\'t used metal utensils in them yet because there\'s really no reason to roll the dice on that....but it seems like this would also prove to be OK as advertised. The red heat indicator is helpful (not necessary), but great when you\'re cooking multiple things and need to glance down and know you\'re at an optimal temperature to throw your meal in. A convenience that\'s nice for sure.These are attractive with a deeper setting rather than the ""flat and wide"" versions that technically measure as larger, but don\'t actually hold more food because they are shallow or graduated out. The handles are easy to use, don\'t get hot, and feel durable/heavy. The bottom of the pans are excellent for your old, electric stove (like ours) that isn\'t exactly top notch for heat consistency anymore. No burning or hot spots with these. Our cooking experience is vastly improved with these pans over any others I\'ve owned and we cook breakfast (eggs, bacon, mushrooms, onions, etc) more than anything. You can easily cook sauteed veggies for omelettes in the smaller pan and the eggs in just a few minutes and the egg and veggie residue rinse clean with dish soap and water even without wiping (though I wash them to ensure bacteria is gone regardless).While *I\'d personally* love it if they could manage the same fun colors as T-Fal\'s cheaper models....it wasn\'t important to my significant other and the function and already-attractive finish alone more than make up for it. This may not be a ""Professional"" piece of cookware....but it sure behaves like one. And for a fraction of the price. This is a fantastic buy for anyone who does a lot of skillet and stovetop cooking and doesn\'t want to spend tons of time soaking pans, scrubbing, or deal with ""seasoning"" and other nonsense that more professional skillets and pans often require.

I\'m still keeping my review at 3 stars though because the thermospot still doesn\'t do anything and I think thermospot does play into the price of the pans. Its just decoration for me at this point. I tried looking up more information about thermospot and there\'s really nothing to find about why it doesn\'t work. Oh well.--I bought these specifically for the thermo spot and nonstick capability. I was excited with the idea of knowing when my pan was ready and I was tired of having to use lots of oil on my old pans to cook something as simple as eggs. If you see in the first two pictures neither of those points delivered. Don\'t assume the worst yet though, keep reading...This was my first use of the pans. I did a cleaning with soap and water per the directions. I did NOT season as a couple of Questions I asked said due the material of the pan seasoning was not necessary. Seasoning made me nervous anyway as seasoning ruined the last nonstick pan I bought.I set the pan on the stove with low to medium heat and waited and waited and the thermo spot never went fully red, I could still see the squares in the circle. At that point I lowered the heat and put my eggs on, I could see them sticking right away, but I was in denial, hoping it would turn out right. It did not. The eggs were sticking, I was disappointed, and mad at myself because I already recycled the box the pans were delivered in (that\'s how much I believed in these pans didn\'t think about a return). It took me a minute to use a spatula to scrape off what had stuck (the best non abrasive method I could try).Then I decided to try again, because my breakfast sandwich was all ready except for the eggs. I wiped the pan with a paper towel before starting again. This time I decided to try with oil. I use a can of organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil that uses air instead of chemical propellants so the oil comes out as actual oil, usually a teaspoon or less sized amount. The thermo spot didn\'t turn fully red and again I had to make the decision myself. I was also impatient and anxious at that point, also hungry. I wanted my breakfast. This time, I\'m assuming thanks to the oil, it worked. The egg didn\'t stick. I was able to scramble the egg in the pan with the spatula, moving it around, not one sign of sticking. It was perfect. It was what I was expecting for the first try.Where I\'m giving these pans the benefit of the doubt:- Perhaps on the first try I let the pan get over heated, as I waiting for the thermospot to go fullu red- Perhaps on the first try all I needed was oil as well- Perhaps I need to do more research on how the thermo spot worksMy life experience, let alone education never taught me about pans or nonstick pans. When I was taught to cook I was taught to use a lot of oil or butter in the pan, which I stopped doing years ago because its not healthy. I\'ve lost almost 100lbs, these days I rarely eat foods with butter and when I use oil I stick to the air spray can because it yields 0-1 calories for a quick two second spray.If its just an issue of needed a little oil I can live with it. I do think its odd since the directions say ""a touch of butter or oil may be used as flavoring to please your taste"", that implies the butter and oil are optional. The directions don\'t say the butter and oil are required. Its fine because like I said I can use the oil and I can even learn how the thermo spot works.Not having the box to return the pans is also a factor of not initating a return. I don\'t keep every box I get when I place online orders. They get dropped off for recycling. The nearest store I could buy a box is over 20 miles away and I\'m risking buying a box that might not even be big enough. I\'m definitely not going to spend $6 or $7 on a Post Office priority mail box either. Unless Amazon has started providing free shipping material for customer to use for returns, a return would just be too much of a hassle right now. Not to mention you can\'t get free UPS pickup anymore and I don\'t live locally to a UPS store, I\'d still have to drive far off for a drop off. Just a big hassle all around.So I\'m keeping an open mind. I am going to try the pans again later. I will update this review if anything changes.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 8, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars I LOVE THESE PANS!', 'author': 'basscatt', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'These are much heavier than the regular T-FAL pansand the definitely distribute the heat more evenlyLOVE THEM!', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 24, 2024', 'is_verified': True}]"

My itching has stopped.This is a very durable fry pan with resemblance to cast iron, including in it's weight. The heat distribution is even and it gets plenty hot. Neither the lid knob nor the pan handle get hot during cooking so you are able to handle either while cooking. This is a great feature. I was used to using pot holders to remove the lid but it is not a problem with this. You will not be able to use this like a Wok as it is just too heavy.My only complaint is the cleaning. Yes, it is nice that you do not have to settle for just oiling a cast iron pan where you are unable to clean with soap. This this, you can clean it in the usual way. I use a non-abrasive Teflon-safe sponge/scrubber or nylon scrubber scroungy. The pan looks very clean when I'm finished but when I go to use it the next time, it appears that anything that settled inside the very small pores of the pan, didn't come out with soaking in hot water and scrubbing with soap.My recommendation is try not to brown or burn anything and you should be fine. Once something is browned, you will see it's residue after cleaning, and in the right light and the right angle. I am so picky when it comes to using clean cookware. However, I have no problem using my outdoor grill which I am sure is loaded with residue. Therefore, I have just convinced myself to pretend I am barbecuing. I won't die from that.

I\'ve done research on the ""Hexclad"" line of pans, but they seem waaaaay too pricey. $160 for a frying pan? No thank you. So I came across this pan, and the reviews seemed favorable. The original price is supposedly $100, but got it on sale for $59. I was skeptical and had low expectations, but when I used it, it blew me away. Eggs did NOT stick. Steak cooked beautifully with great crust with minimal oil. Vegetables cooked perfectly. Then after the pan cools, all you have to do is wipe it with a paper towel and you\'re good to go for the next meal. I think the key is to follow the instructions to ""season"" the pan before using it for the first time. Put some high temperature oil (like any vegetable oil, but NOT olive oil) in the pan and put on low heat. Then evenly spread the oil over the whole pan while it\'s on low heat with a paper towel. In this way it is similar to a cast iron pan in the way you have to season the surface. However this pan is a fusion of cast iron and traditional non-stick pans, and thus has the best features of both. It is a bit heavier than traditional non-stick pans, but not as heavy as cast iron. After several meals prepared in this pan, it seems to be well built and sturdy and will be able to be used for a long time in the future.

While I would say it is average at best for browning meat, it may be that I haven't completely learned the best heat and time required for the different meats. Don't get me wrong, it can brown meat fabulously but you may need to adjust your past ways.Browning meat aside, these are well built pans. They are considerably heavier than the nonstick pans you may have been using but much lighter than cast iron. They appear two be a cast iron bottom heat surface with a nonstick cooking surface seamlessly mated together. The handles appear to be solid - maybe aluminum - and are securely fastened by two hefty rivets.The cooking surface is very slippery which probably necessitates the dimpled surface. In fact, the nonstick is so slippery, you could simply wipe the skillet interior clean immediately after cooking (the warmth helps) and you wouldn't know you had just cooked in it.I can't speak for the durability, but after two months of daily use they still look like new. I do recommend highly these pans if your budget allows it."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 5, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '3.0 out of 5 stars A Need Or a Novelty?', 'author': 'My Own AMZN', 'rating': 3, 'content': ""I already have an 8-inch cast iron pan but when seeing this pan on sale during the most recent Amazon Black Friday sale, thought I'd pick it up and see if it lived up to the claim of a cast iron pan that is also non-stick. Included in the box is the pan and instruction booklet.Upon taking out of the box, the first noticeable features of this pan is the stainless steel handle and the honeycomb surface. The main draw of the pan is the honeycomb surface as that is what gives the pan the non-stick feature. Instructions said to wash and then season the surface of the pan with some cooking oil. I didn't use as much oil for a regular cast iron pan but used a paper towel to spread the oil over the honeycomb area and rest of the top pan surface.Another thing easily noticeable is the pan is a bit lighter than my regular cast iron pan. I weighed the difference and this pan was about 1 lb lighter. I decided the best way to see if the pan works well for me is to try cooking in.The first meal I prepared was a fried egg. It felt strange not adding any more oil than usual. As for the egg, it did cook and I could slide the egg around. In other words, the non-stick did work.The second meal I used the pan for was to sear a pork chop. When using I noticed that holding onto the handle felt a bit awkward. The handle isn't perpendicular to the pan. It is at a bit on an angle, which puts a bit extra pressure on the wrist. Also, I noticed that the pork chop, which would normally easily fit in my regular cast iron pan didn't quite fit all the way. I think because the shape of the pan's sides is curved as opposed the flaring out like regular pans. I did my best to sear the pork chop. The sear turned out okay. Because I used less oil than normal, the sear wasn't as much. Also, noticeable was the there wasn't the crispiness in the vegetables I cooked with the pork chop. To pork chop didn't stick to the pan.The third meal I cooked was some salmon. I figured since this is non-stick, the salmon would be a good test. Once again, I didn't use much oil. After cooking, the salmon didn't stick to the pan but some of the skin and fish meat did. This sticking could have perhaps been avoided had I added more oil. But I thought one of the benefits of this pan is no need for much oil as otherwise, then why not just use a regular cast iron? After use, the pan was easy to clean with a rinse and wipe.After making these three meals with this non-stick cast iron pan, I decided to return and stay with the old fashioned cast iron that I already own. Perhaps I should have used higher heat (the instructions said to not use too high heat while leaving the pan empty, especially when new) and more oil. But if so, then is this really that much different than a regular cast iron as if a regular is well seasoned and used with enough oil, that pretty much non stick also.Here is what I like and dislike of this non-slip cast iron pan:Likes:- attractive look- adds non-stick via honeycomb surface- lighter in weight than traditional cast iron pan- might be healthier requiring less oil to cook with- easy to clean- doesn't rustDislkes:- angle of handle gave extra pressure on wrist when holding- surface area seems smaller than regular cast iron- miss the oil flavor in foodsThis non-stick iron cast iron pan with the honeycomb non-stick feature might work well for some.

I put the chicken breasts in, let it brown a while and then just jiggled the pan a little. The chicken slid around much to my joy and I had beautifully browned meat that was so easy to turn over. I wish I had known about this cookware 3 years ago because I invested in 3 separate types of pans, all which failed after a year and had to be given away. This cookware is worth every penny you pay for it.The next pan I bought was a large dutch oven with a lid. I made a white sauce first. I've never had a pan like this. As soon as I mixed the melted butter and flour together, the roux bubbled beautifully from one edge of the pan to the other--no hot or cold spots. Perfect roux!My next pan will be the large roaster. Looking forward to that for sure. Every time I cook with these beautifully made quality pans I feel such appreciation for them. Even though the instructions say you can use metal utensils, I still am careful with them.

Mine arrived in great shape. I\'ve done some cooking with them (on a glass-top stove) and they are indeed no stick. I have cooked eggs without using anything to keep them from sticking. The eggs just slid out of the pan and onto the plate.I think with these pans IT\'S IMPORTANT TO READ THE LITTLE MANUAL THAT COMES WITH THEM BEFORE YOU USE THEM. There are some recommendations there that will make these pans last a lot longer. They recommend that you coat the inside of each pan with cooking oil on low stove-top heat for two minutes...let cool and then wipe off. I did this and the oil did indeed soak into the pan like it was supposed to, making it VERY non-stick. My guess is that this might need to be done from time to time. Also, they recommend that you don\'t take a hot pan right off the stove and put cold water into it...it may scald. Things like this are important to know. So be sure to read your manual.I took one star off because I think the knob handles on the glass lids are weird. They are wood (looking) and then have this rubber leaf-shaped thing that goes on the end. My rubber ends keep coming off. Why was the lid handle not just rounded on the end to keep things simple? The massive lid handles make the lids hard to stack and store. I think this is supposed to be a ""design"" thing...but to me, it\'s ""form over function"".

It heats up relatively fast despite not being able to use high heat, cooks food great, very versatile, it\'s truly, I mean truly, non-stick, and it\'s such a dream to clean.That being said, I can only give it 4 stars because:- It\'s kinda heavy. Not crazy heavy, just uncomfortable to hold for very long with one hand. Because of the weight, the handle started getting lose relatively quickly and had to be tightened.- I feel I have to be paranoid about not letting it get scratched and ruining that wonderful non-stick coating. Silicone utensils only. No high heat. Clean with soft sponge only instead of my usual dish wand (yes, even though the dish wand scrubber says non-stick safe, over a long period of time, it\'s not). I wash it asap and don\'t let it sit in the sink, because family members will inevitably throw metal utensils or other dishes inside it and scratch it. Can\'t nest any other cooking pans inside it for the same reason, so it takes up a lot of space in my cupboard.If you don\'t want a fussy-to-maintain pan, it\'s not technically the fault of the pan, but people should be aware. I was really hesitant to buy this because of the negative reviews and pictures, and honestly, most of those problems are probably due to poor maintenance, like all the ""dos and don\'ts"" I mentioned above.If you treat it right, it\'s fine.

During the last 10 years I purchased over a dozen so-called ""Non-Stick"" pans some of which were advertised on TV. Within a few months to 1 year all of these Non-Stick Pans purchases were burned & stained heavily with grease and were no longer Non-Stick at all. I have disposed of about 11 of them. I only kept one for toasting one side of a bagel- it is good for little else. I eventually came to the conclusion that non-stick pans were far from perfected. Then in browsing through pots & pans (in Amazon) I came upon one 12inch pan that was written to be made of ""granite stone"" whatever that meant. Now, the word ""granite"" struck me, since I have a Brazilian granite kitchen Countertop that even after 15 years of daily use, it still looks like the day it was delivered-- perfectly smooth, glistening and unbreakable. My other definite memory of granite relates to a trip, I had made as a visiting professor to The University Hospital of Padua, Italy, some 30+ years ago. At this Hospital the Head of The Hospital, took me on a tour to experience many interesting exhibits of ancient wonders, since this Hospital was founded some 400 years ago, around the time of Leonardo Da Vinci. Leonardo was the most important figure to herald in ""The Renaissance"". He was one of the first to perform autopsies, in order to learn human anatomy, for his works of art that included the human figure. Anyway, the Head Doctor of Padua Hospital took me to a room which he explained to me, was the very first autopsy table, which was made of granite, and was over 400 years old. He also explained to me that Padua Hospital, was the home of the first autopsies, ever performed in modern Western Civilization. I was amazed by the fact that The table was still absolutely pristine in terms of its appearance of the granite slab, even though several thousand autopsies were performed on this historic table. For the above reasons I decided to take my chances one more time on a ""Non-Stick Pan"" despite my many prior disappointments. I received this pan about 3 months ago, and have used it many times since, to make recipes such as: Sicilian Pasta Tomato Sauce (2-3 hours of cooking time); Pork Chops cooked in 50/50 Milk & Cream Bologonaise style (2 hours); Wor Wonton Soups (Cantonese Style); Sirloin & Rib-Eye Steaks, perfectly braised & fried; and 3 inch high omelettes that slide right out of the pan after using only 1 to 2 tablespoons of olive and/or avocado oil. The pan still looks completely like the day I took it out of its box. I also love the 12 inch beautifully made glass cover. It also displays a long, pretty pan handle on one side, and a much shorter handle on the opposite side, that lets you easily pick up or turn the pan without need for gloves. I also love the two side spout-like bends in the pot with which to enable you to pour out its remaining contents more easily without spillage. Also impressive is its 5.5 quart size excellent for making sauces and soups and the nice height of the pan, preventing splatter. Yes, I truly and wholeheartedly recommend buying this pan with a few words of caution related to the following: when I read a small minority of the buyer reviews, I was concerned by the fact that several of these purchasers were most unhappy with the burning of the granite even with some flaking described of the granite-stone lining itself. The question I asked myself-- why did I not corroborate these nasty findings. This did not happen, for example when I cooked using high heat to sear & cook several steaks in 1-2 tbl. of oil. I have come up with a probable explanation. Even though it is described as granite-stone I do not believe it is the actual Granite Stone of which our kitchen countertops are made of, but probably, a composite of granite chips pressed together using many tons of pressure when manufacturing the pan (refer to Non-Stick Pan Manufacturing Processes on ""You Tube"" to understand this better). If this supposition is correct, then it is likely, that this pan\'s granite material has a certain heat tolerance beyond which it may actually burn and breakdown. Recently my 20 year old electric stove-top broke down by getting extremely hot and even burned perfectly good stainless steel pots. A few weeks before I bought the above pan, I purchased (from Amazon again) a new electric stove-top that shuts off if a heat- element, if it gets too hot after removing the old stove-top The new electric stove top is definitely superior to the old one I got rid, which likely goes back to past times when such top were in their early infancy to childhood phases of development. Many years later many improvements must have been made. So for those of you that had this pan burn and flake on you-- you should consider that perhaps your stove top is getting to 600 to 700 (too hot) or more degrees, rather that a much safer 500 degrees and below.

This makes cooking and cleaning a breeze.- Heats up quickly: The hard-anodized aluminum construction of the pan ensures that it heats up quickly and evenly.

Allen', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I bought one of these 12"" skillets a couple of months ago. I was delivered within 2 days (I\'m a Prime member) and it arrived safely packed and undamaged. It comes with a very nice vented, clear glass lid. The construction is very solid - it feels well-made and a little heavy. The material it\'s built from (Titanium) appears to be excellent - no more worrying about flaking Teflon. I did a lot of research on no-stick skillets and this brand (company) often made it into the top 10, so I thought I\'d try it out. The price is excellent considering what you get.I usually cook on high heat and so far, have had no issues (no warping, charring, distortions, etc.) with this skillet. I mainly cook omelets but have also cooked chicken breasts and steaks. I usually cook with Canola or Olive oil and sometimes Coconut oil. Some people have claimed that you don\'t need any oil or anything to prevent sticking when using these. I experimented with cooking eggs with no oil and it was nearly a disaster - the eggs stuck for the most part (not too badly though). I don\'t cooking without some sort of oil to prevent sticking.My biggest complaint is the bottom of the skillet. I have a gas range and unfortunately, the bottom of the skillet is extremely slippery. On a few occasions the skillet nearly slipped off the stove. I got used to it and was more careful and to date, have had no accidents (keep the little ones away from this when it\'s used for cooking). The other thing about the red dot in the center (inside the pan) glowing red when it\'s ready... meh. I haven\'t noticed it glowing. None of these issues really lowers my rating on this product. I recommend it. We\'ll see how it holds up over the years.Also, I just bought a second one recently because it\'s a solid product and I couldn\'t stand my awful Rachel Ray Teflon skillets anymore.I hope this is helpful.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States March 13, 2021', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect for cooking Chinese dishes!', 'author': 'Michelle Tan', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I use it to cook Chinese dishes.

Considering how much a complete set of pots and pans cost, I couldn't understand how a single add-on pan could be so expensive. I guess that is how they get you to spend all that $$.Anyway, I was looking for an alternative pan that cost less. I found the Cuisinart pan and saw that it had good reviews. It was also fairly inexpensive, compared to the All-Clad pan. I have now been cooking with it for about two weeks, and I love it! I find very little difference cooking with it compared to my other pans. It heats quickly and evenly and cleans up great. My daycare provider accidentally over-cooked oil in the pan and it turned all brown and hard. I sprayed some oven cleaner on it and sat it in the sun for about 20 minutes, and the pan looks like new.The only area I find a very, very slight difference is at high temperatures. It doesn't seem to handle them quite as well--maybe it is that it ends up getting too hot compared to the All-Clad set, but it is probably because I am just so used to the other set.

I have done nothing but struggle with them and I\'ve lost count on how many eggs they have ruined. I admit that when I got them, I used a spray olive oil on them because I had NO IDEA that this would cause a problem. I\'ve used spray oils on my pans without an issue since spray oils became a thing. My bad. So I followed Cuisnart\'s instructions on cleaning them after using a spray oil (white vinegar/baking soda treatments and Barkeepers Friend). I\'ve scrubbed and scrubbed them. They continue to destroy fried eggs. These things are incredibly finicky to cook with. You must follow specific heating instructions to have any hope that they will work: Heat on medium high, do the water drop test, if the water drop test passes treat only with a high temp oil (from a bottle NOT a spray!) If you don\'t do it just exactly right, they fail. So I figured by having used a spray oil on the original 4 I had wrecked them. So I went a bought a 5th one, brand new. Never had any spray oil applied to it. Followed the strict procedure for heating and oiled with grapeseed oil. Same result! I\'m going to have to go find and buy different pans, these aren\'t working. They work OK for other things, but I specifically use these ones (the 8"") for frying eggs and making omelettes.

I always season my cast iron - new, or used (hey, I don\'t know WHAT someone else used that old piece of cast iron for - maybe cleaning auto parts). I sand it down to bare metal, starting with about an 80 grit and finishing with 200.Then I season. The end result is a glossy black mirror that puts Teflon to shame. There are two mistakes people make when seasoning - not hot enough, not long enough. These mistakes give the same result - a sticky brown coating that is definitely not non-stick, and the first time they bring any real heat to the pan, clouds of smoke that they neither expected or wanted. I see several complaints here that are completely due to not knowing this.But there were a few pieces I needed (yes, needed, cast iron isn\'t about want, it\'s a need), and this was one of them, so I thought I\'d give the Lodge pre-seasoning a try. Ordered last Friday, received this Friday - free shipping, yay!The first thing I noticed was the bumpy coating. The inside is actually rougher than the outside, and my hand was itching for the sandpaper, but that would have defeated the experiment. This time, I was going to give the Lodge pre-seasoning a chance before I broke out the sandpaper. So I scrubbed the pan out with a plastic brush and a little soapy water, rinsed well, put it on a medium burner, and waited. Cast iron tip number one - give it a little time. Then give it a little more time. Cast iron conducts heat much more slowly than aluminum, so you have to have a little patience.Then I threw in a pat of butter, and brought out the natural enemy of badly seasoned cast iron - the egg. And, sure enough, it stuck - but not badly, just in the middle. A bit of spatula work and I actually got a passable over-medium egg. Hmmm. But still not good enough. So I cleaned up the pan, and broke out the lard.I have only one justification for using lard. I don\'t remember Grandma using refined hand-pressed organic flax oil, or purified extra-virgin olive oil made by real virgins. Nope, it was pretty much animal fat in her iron. A scoop of bacon grease from the mason jar beside the stove and she was ready to cook anything. Grandaddy wouldn\'t eat a piece of meat that had less than a half-inch of fat around it. ""Tastes like a dry old shoe."", he\'d declare if it was too lean. In the end, I\'m sure their diet killed them, but they ate well in the meantime. Grandaddy was cut down at the tender age of 96, and Grandma lasted till 98. Eat what you want folks - in the end, it\'s pretty much up to your genetics.So I warmed up my new pieces, and smeared a very thin layer of lard all over them - use your fingers. Towels, especially paper towels, will shed lint, and lint in your seasoning coat doesn\'t help things at all. Besides, it\'s kinda fun.Here\'s cast iron tip number two - season at the highest temp you think you\'ll ever cook at - or higher. If you don\'t, you won\'t get the full non-stick thing, and the first time you bring it up to that temp you\'ll get clouds of smoke from the unfinished seasoning. I put my pieces in a cold oven, and set the temp for an hour at 500 degrees (F, not C). Yeah, I know, Lodge says 350. Lodge doesn\'t want panicked support calls from people whose house is full of smoke. Crank the heat up.You have two choices here. You can put a fan in the kitchen window and blow smoke out of your house like the battleship Bismarck under attack by the Royal Navy, or invest in an oxygen mask. You will get smoke. You will get lots of smoke, especially if you\'re doing several pieces at once, like I just did. This is a good thing - that\'s smoke that won\'t be jumping out to surprise you the first time you try to cook with any real heat. The goal is to heat until you don\'t get smoke, and in my experience, 500 degrees for an hour does that pretty well.Let the pieces cool in the closed oven. Then re-grease and repeat. And repeat again. And don\'t glop the fat on. Just enough to coat. More thin layers are better than fewer gloppy layers. I managed four layers last night without my neighbors calling the fire department.Seems like a lot of work? Look at it this way. It\'s a lifetime commitment. Treat your iron well, and it will love you right back like you\'ve never been loved before. And this is pretty much a one-time deal, unless you do something silly.The end result of my all-night smoking up the kitchen exercise? Dry, absolutely no stickiness, black as a coal mine at midnight and shiny - but still bumpy - could it possibly work with that rough surface?I put the skillet back on a medium burner, put a pat of butter on and tossed in a couple of eggs. After the whites had set a little, I nudged them with a spatula, and they scooted across the pan. I\'ll be... it works. My wife came back from the store and wanted scrambled eggs. If there\'s anything that cast iron likes less than fried eggs, it\'s scrambled. But it was the same thing all over again. No stick. No cleanup. Just a quick hot water rinse with a brush in case something got left on the pan (I couldn\'t see anything, but hey), then I put it on a med-hi burner till dry, put a thin coat of lard on the pan and waited until I saw smoke for a minute. Let cool and hang up. Done.So. do I like the bumpy texture of the Lodge pre-season? Nope. Does it work? Yes, and contrary to my misgivings, it works very well. My wife pointed out that even some Teflon cookware has textured patterns in it. The Lodge pre-season isn\'t a perfect surface out of the box - but it does give you a big head-start. After a night\'s work, my iron is ready to face anything, and you just can\'t beat that.Lodge makes a great product. For the quality, durability, and versatility, you can\'t beat Lodge cast iron. Plus, it\'s made in America. I like that. If you\'ve never experienced cast iron cooking, you\'ve just been cheating yourself. Plus, the price, for a piece of lifetime cookware, is insanely cheap.And my sandpaper is still on the tool shelf.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States November 17, 2007', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Just the Right Size', 'author': 'Linda B.', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'This is the perfect size for eggs, potatoes, bacon, etc. easy clean up and very little seasoning needed.

I cleaned with water and salt and it looked like the seasoning was coming off as the bottom of the pan was getting lighter than the rest of the pan.I searched the internet on the topic of cast iron and after reading many articles came to the conclusion that the problem with this pan is that it has a rough surface. I learned that the iron pans from the past and some current manufacturers use a different manufacturing process that produces a smooth surface which is much easier to clean and the food actually does slide out after proper seasoning.

It’s great for making recipes where you start by frying something in a pan, then add more ingredients until you have a soup or chili. The bottom is the size of a normal saucepan, giving you plenty of room to cook—so much better than trying to fry in a soup pot—and the sides are more than high enough to hold a soup recipe. It’s an unusual size of pan in the US, but after trying it, I’m surprised that it’s not more common.The non-stick surface is excellent. The one drawback is that it discolors after a while, developing a brownish stain from either heat or food, I’m not sure which. In my experience this is common with all pans, and it’s purely cosmetic.

I've never used metal anything in this pan. It's never been harshly scrubbed or left to soak for a long time in the sink. Yet it developed scratches and finally lost some skin. So, while I highly recommend Eslite Life cookware to anyone considering it - don't use anything but silicone utensils in it. The vendor really needs to make that suggestion more prominent. Nylon utensils are not that great anyway but this pan is awesome. Cooks even and does an excellent job at anything that doesn't need high heat.

My other pan which was a few dollars cheaper than this one started to lose its coating after a year or so. The video on this one really showed it to be scratch resistant. 2 egg omelets are really easy as well. I liked the qualities and performance so much that I ordered the larger 12"" pan.

When I ordered one for him,I decided to give a few of them as gifts..My sister right away tried to fry and egg in hers without butter or oil, likethey did in the commercial. The egg stuck, and burnt. After a search onlineI saw someone refer to the instructions which state not to cook food at highheat, to cook food at medium heat. She had better success on her second attempt.My friend who just got her pan today cooked turkey burgers in her pan, she said sheburnt her burgers as well, but also commented ""but it came right off"". She said shecooked some more and they came out good.All 3 people have burnt food in their pans, but all 3 said the pan was very easy to clean,they just wiped it with a wet rag or paper towel.The one my dad uses, shows no wear at all, and hes been using it daily for 2 weeks.So my conclusion here, is that maybe these pans transfer the heat better than the pansthey have been using and the food is cooking faster. I warned my friend as soon as I gaveit to her, not to cook on high, and she still burnt the burgers.Also the claim that they are easy to clean holds up, because everyone has commented aboutthat, because they all burnt food.. which is kind of funny. But this also a reason I bought themthese pans in the first place, 1 was constantly complained about food sticking to their old pan,and blaming it on everyone else scratching the pans, the other person was burning food frequentlyprobably from distractions and not watching the food closely.So far these have been a good purchase for this people.

Two is that my stove is electric and setup with 1-10 on the dials on the stove top. I have cooked in it each night and I have had no issues. I have to wonder if some of the sticking issue people are having with eggs is from cooking too hot. This morning for example I turned the burner on 8 and let the pan warm up while i beat the eggs for my omelette and prepared everything. That took about 3 minutes. I dropped a small about of butter into the pan for flavor.(about a 1/4 teaspoon) Then I poured the egg in,turned the burner down to 7 and cooked my breakfast. No sticking at all, even the shredded cheese that feel to the sides flipped with the omelette when i closed it up. That made me wonder. I placed the pan back on the burner and pulled out a slice of sharp cheddar. Thick sliced not thin. I dropped it in the pan and let it melt for 30 seconds. I then poured the melted slice out and onto the top of the omelette. No scrapping or anything. So far it is good.

I love them.Pros:-Amazingly nonstick. I wanted a quick omelette for my first test. I only had to give the pan two shakes to finish my eggs. After letting the eggs heat up to firm on the bottom I gave the pan one shake to cause one side to fold over, and one final shake to flip it over and finish the other side. The omelette easily slid out onto my plate. I wiped out the pan with a paper towel, and it looks like new. That's true nonstick. No tools, no cleaning, the pan does all the work.-Inexpensive. There are 2 schools for nonstick pans. One says you should buy a really expensive, maybe a ceramic Le Creuset type pan, which will last a long time and give the best experience. The other says you should go with something relatively inexpensive like this T-Fal set, because you know over time someone in your family is going to be an idiot and scrape the coating off your pans with metal utensils. I'm in the latter camp, so I absolutely love this set.Cons:-None. As said, so long as you're in the school where you'd prefer inexpensive nonstick pans, these things are wonders. Sure they don't retain heat like a big ceramic, sure a heavier pan could distribute heat better. But these are amazing at their price point, and their heat distribution is way better than you'd expect.Overall:This is my go-to for nonstick pans. Get something inexpensive, and in 5+ years when they're starting to get scraped up from misuse, you don't feel bad about replacing them. My mom's the type to always go for the heavy ceramic nonstick, and it kills her every time she has to replace one - but that doesn't stop her from damaging the coating with metal implements all the time either!

I have always been concerned with the safety claims related to teflon (PFTE) and thus before turning back to them, I tried ceramic options as an alternative. However they turned out to be such under-performers, with food sticking all the time and causing permanent stains which looks (and probably is) burnt. Besides, those alternatives, that are sold with greener and healthier claims, are also questionable due to the possibility they might be leeching heavy metals to the food.Besides, recently, I have come across reports saying that the nastier effects are mostly due to the chemical called PFOA rather than the actual teflon material which is PFTE. PFOA has been shown to cause cancer in experimental models but it is almost entirely gone after the pans came to their final state of manufacturing. Yet again, even those who work in teflon industry (so getting much higher exposure than general household user did not suffer an increased cancer rate according to WebMD) The good news is that for most modern models PFOA is removed from the manufacturing process and this set is among them with no PFOA to worry about. The other chemical which is the main ingredient of teflon is PFTE and it can start fuming out at very high temperatures (higher than most normal cooking procedures) and the only adverse effect that has been shown after massive exposure (which is unlikely in household settings) is some flu like symptoms. After these data, I obtained from various sources, I decided to come back to teflon again.However despite all those claims, I recommend potential buyers to limit teflon use as much as possible and use stainless steel cookware everywhere possible (if sticking is not a major problem for what you are cooking). Additionally I recommend not to use the pans when they start showing signs of wearing out. I believe that precautions would make me safer for the known and unknown effects and yet allow me to enjoy the convenience teflon has over other so called non-stick stuff. (Please make your own research for complete peace of mind rather than taking my word as true)Finally, I particularly liked this product due to its decent price-tag ($23 for 3 pans as of august 2014), even cooking and the company reputation (T-fal). I have used many different brands and T-fal has prevailed in most cases.

I’d been wanted to ditch my non-stick cookware for several years for health reasons but couldn’t find the right fit. I’m spoiled by growing up cooking with only non-stick cookware. And I’m NOT a good cook so I tend to overheat pans & burn food. AND I sooo dislike cleaning up after cooking that I’d prefer to do it later (like the next day). I’m possibly the worst case scenario for testing any cookware line. I’d honestly much rather enjoy being served nice meals in restaurants. But, I’m immunocompromised so COVID changed all that. So, I’ve needed to up my game & learn to cook decently.I first tested several brands of stainless steel cookware. It was a total nightmare for me to clean. I then tried out ceramic cookware but found it to be too heavy for my arthritic joints. After reading about and researching Hestan’s Nanobond’s titanium coating, I thought it sounded promising & ordered this pan. Besides, the design of all of Hestan’s cookware is simply gorgeous.This Hestan Nanobond pan turned out to be AMAZING. My 1st test was fried eggs that turned out perfect with no sticking and easy cleanup afterwards. I’d read to heat the pan first, then add the oil/butter next & let it heat, and to then add the eggs. That definitely works to make the surface as close to being non-stick without actually having a non-stick coating. I’ve used it repeatedly for sticky foods like fried eggs, scrambled eggs, grilled cheese sandwiches, etc. with thrilling results. Best of all, it’s easy to clean afterwards.The Hestan Nanobond cookware is fantastic & suits my needs perfectly. I’ve now bought many more of the pots and pans in all shapes & sizes. I’m thrilled with the good looks & performance of the Nanobond line, the ease of cleaning up afterwards, and the titanium coating’s overall forgivingness for bad cooks. I accidentally added ground sausage needing to be browned for a casserole directly to their still-warming 3.5 quart sauté pan. The sausage stuck immediately to the bottom & I knew I’d really screwed up. While stirring the rest of the meat with only a silicon spatula, however, the stuck remnants surprisingly released completely from the bottom! I then decided to go ahead & try baking the entire casserole in the covered Nanobond pan in the oven instead of dirtying up a casserole dish. The casserole turned out fantastic with perfectly browned sides & bottom. The servings easily released from the pan without falling apart. And the very baked-on food remnants STILL cleaned up easily. The beautiful design of Hestan’s cookware really makes it equally appealing for stove/oven to table presentation.

I am hesitant to buy the larger skillets if they are going to be super thin like the 8 inch is.BOTTOM LINE:I think I’m going to love this pan for scrambled eggs, and I don’t know what else.. I plan to try a reverse sear with salmon or a hamburger.. I usually slow cook vegetables in an enameled cast iron sauce pan, so I don’t have to worry about salt and other seasonings leaching the SS.. But I suppose I will try some vegetables in the nano bond titanium (as a little browning is supposed to add a layer of flavor.. but I suspect browning anything is less healthy).STICK, OR NOT TO STICK?Mystery solved.. I was perplexed by so many reviews complaining about things sticking to the titanium nanobond, because my scrambled eggs were sliding around, almost like a nonstick pan. I just watched a video comparison of three different stainless steel pans.. The Heston nanobond, and demeyere (both of which I have cooked scrambled eggs on).. In the video they got the pans hot until the water drops danced around, which I think of it as a trick that allows you to cook scrambled eggs in cast-iron.. Plus they used what looked like some kind of vegetable oil.. And the egg was stuck in the pan bad.. I use butter at a low temperature (which I believe is appropriate for eggs), and the eggs don’t stick at all..LEACHING INTO FOODI’ve always heard that titanium is extremely non-reactive, but I have been UNABLE to find any information (other than manufacturers claims) whether titanium cookware will leach anything into food while cooking (ie: acidic foods, like tomato paste, or how it’s well known that salt will pit stainless steel).. Titanium is supposed to be completely safe for humans, so we can only hope if anything leeches it would be pure titanium (manufacturers tend to be untrustworthy, I can only hope in Italy they have tighter regulations for such things than in America).. If you search the Internet you can find where testing was done with SS pans.. Some manufacturers claim you can cook tomato red sauce in them (even though tomatoes do leech from SS)..SUPER THIN?When I say super thin, perhaps I’m spoiled by using expensive aluminum clad cookware from other brands that have a hefty amount of aluminum.. Because of the high price of Heston nano bond cookware, they should pop for thick enough aluminum layer to where we should have to wonder if it’s enough.. And to be clear I don’t know how thick the aluminum layer needs to be to do. It’s job..The thin-ness of the pan makes me wonder if it would be prone to warping (with my other stainless steel pans, I clean them while they are hot, but I am fearful to put water into these thin nano bond skillets).. NOTE: I don’t put a lot of cold water into a hot pan, rather a little bit that steam cleans most of the pan (none of my pans have ever warped).HEAT MOMENTUM:The other problem with extra thin aluminum cladding is heat momentum.. Heat momentum is one of the reasons cast-iron pans work so well for certain things (such as putting a frozen hamburger patty, and getting heat momentum to create the seer.. instead of the frozen patty immediately cooling off the pan which destroys the seer). In my particular case, using the control freak induction burner that has a built-in temperature probe, it will probably compensate by instantly turning the power up (which I hear it doing when I take a little off, to try to maintain temperature).. I doubt the thin aluminum will work in this instance, if you’re trying to cook a frozen steak or anything substantial without cool in the pan off..NON-STICK:I have not used nonstick pans for decades, but I have been cooking scrambled eggs in aluminum clad stainless steel pans for years.. And for the past year. I’ve been using Demeyere SS skillets, which have a treated SS surface that concentrates the chromium and nickel and removes the iron (it makes the stainless steel, more stainless steel, and it does stick less than regular SS, but not by much)..[Again contrary to what many reviews are saying], when I cooked scrambled eggs in the Heston nanobond it felt like nonstick to me. There was an obvious non-stick quality even compared to my demeyere). Like my demeyere pans, I expect I will have to occasionally use the special cleaner, or barkeepers friend, to get rid of the haze/seasoning that develops (this is expected)..Likewise cleanup was very easy (like I would imagine non-stick would be).TOO—LIGHT—WEIGHT?I know other reviews think it’s thick/heavy, but it is by far the lightest pan I have ever held in my hands (and I’ve used a few different brands of aluminum clad stainless steel pans).. I realize titanium is light weight, but the nano bond is a very thin layer of titanium (presumably over stainless steel)..The pan is so light weight that it’s causing the problem with my control, freak induction burner.. The 8” or will sit flat by itself, but because it’s so light weight, and the handle is relatively heavy, it will not sit flat on the induction burner for preheating, because there is a temperature probe in the center (that has a lightweight spring)..And (when cooking anything sensitive to uneven heat) you very much need to preheat pans on an induction burner, because the nature of induction heats the pan itself so there is always a hot ring in the center of the pan that matches the induction ring (preheating for a while lets the heat spread out)..BOTTOM LINE: I was able to preheat the pan to cook my scrambled eggs, but one end of the pan was about 1/8” off the induction burner (and induction burners are sensitive to this.I WOULD HATE: to try to preheat the 8” pan for a seer on this induction burner (the 1/8” in the air might end up a huge problem at high power settings)..COOKING TECHNIQUES:There is technique to consider in whether eggs or anything sticks or not..For scrambled eggs I use low heat (228F.. since my induction burner controls the temperature).. and I use plenty of butter (I am convinced, low carb is healthy, and butter and egg yolks are healthy fats).. my eggs were sliding around the pan like the nonstick advertisements..CLEANUP:My experience with cleanup was like you would imagine nonstick. But I’ve seen many reviews complain about food sticking to the pan (I can only assume they were using high heat, and maybe little or no oil).. I can’t say for sure, but I know with my other stainless steel pans anytime something sticks, I just put a squeeze of dish soap and a little water and come back in an hour (or the next morning).. If I’m in a hurry, I’ll turn on the burner for a few seconds so warm soap will work faster.. Then whatever was stuck on usually falls off.. Sometimes I use vinegar (I don’t know whether dish soap vinegar would be more effective)..', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 20, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Very high quality in ALMOST every area.', 'author': 'Teddy', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'Pros: the finish looks beautiful as it’s slightly a smoky grey color which is very smooth and though not nonstick is less sticky than other stainless steel pans I’ve used.

Mostly small nitpicks but for an expensive pan small can be big depending on your taste. Pricey. On my induction top at least the pan bottom warps very slightly so as thin coat of oil tends to pool towards the outer edges of the pan, this pretty common in a lot of pans but i do wish at this price it could be avoided.

I love them.Pros:-Amazingly nonstick. I wanted a quick omelette for my first test. I only had to give the pan two shakes to finish my eggs. After letting the eggs heat up to firm on the bottom I gave the pan one shake to cause one side to fold over, and one final shake to flip it over and finish the other side. The omelette easily slid out onto my plate. I wiped out the pan with a paper towel, and it looks like new. That's true nonstick. No tools, no cleaning, the pan does all the work.-Inexpensive. There are 2 schools for nonstick pans. One says you should buy a really expensive, maybe a ceramic Le Creuset type pan, which will last a long time and give the best experience. The other says you should go with something relatively inexpensive like this T-Fal set, because you know over time someone in your family is going to be an idiot and scrape the coating off your pans with metal utensils. I'm in the latter camp, so I absolutely love this set.Cons:-None. As said, so long as you're in the school where you'd prefer inexpensive nonstick pans, these things are wonders. Sure they don't retain heat like a big ceramic, sure a heavier pan could distribute heat better. But these are amazing at their price point, and their heat distribution is way better than you'd expect.Overall:This is my go-to for nonstick pans. Get something inexpensive, and in 5+ years when they're starting to get scraped up from misuse, you don't feel bad about replacing them. My mom's the type to always go for the heavy ceramic nonstick, and it kills her every time she has to replace one - but that doesn't stop her from damaging the coating with metal implements all the time either!

I have always been concerned with the safety claims related to teflon (PFTE) and thus before turning back to them, I tried ceramic options as an alternative. However they turned out to be such under-performers, with food sticking all the time and causing permanent stains which looks (and probably is) burnt. Besides, those alternatives, that are sold with greener and healthier claims, are also questionable due to the possibility they might be leeching heavy metals to the food.Besides, recently, I have come across reports saying that the nastier effects are mostly due to the chemical called PFOA rather than the actual teflon material which is PFTE. PFOA has been shown to cause cancer in experimental models but it is almost entirely gone after the pans came to their final state of manufacturing. Yet again, even those who work in teflon industry (so getting much higher exposure than general household user did not suffer an increased cancer rate according to WebMD) The good news is that for most modern models PFOA is removed from the manufacturing process and this set is among them with no PFOA to worry about. The other chemical which is the main ingredient of teflon is PFTE and it can start fuming out at very high temperatures (higher than most normal cooking procedures) and the only adverse effect that has been shown after massive exposure (which is unlikely in household settings) is some flu like symptoms. After these data, I obtained from various sources, I decided to come back to teflon again.However despite all those claims, I recommend potential buyers to limit teflon use as much as possible and use stainless steel cookware everywhere possible (if sticking is not a major problem for what you are cooking). Additionally I recommend not to use the pans when they start showing signs of wearing out. I believe that precautions would make me safer for the known and unknown effects and yet allow me to enjoy the convenience teflon has over other so called non-stick stuff.

They basically have all of the pros of true non-stick (like ceramic) and seasoned cast iron, without the cons. I love how non-stick ceramic pots and pans are, but even following the care instructions to a ""T"" (handwash only, only use silicon utensils, etc.), they end up scratching horribly and with time, things begin sticking. I feel like the only solution is to replace them about every 1 - 2 years, which feels wasteful and expensive to me.I love the idea of cast iron and being non-toxic, but the reality can be a pain. They require a lot of re-seasoning to maintain their non-stick coating, are incredibly heavy, bulky, and if you cook anything fishy or acidic in them, they need a good washing and re-seasoning after. I work full-time and have young kids and while I love cooking, I just don\'t have time or energy for the upkeep of cast iron.Then I randomly stumbled across these. They had excellent reviews and really intrigued me. I\'ve owned them for a couple of months now and cannot be more in love with them. I scoured all of the questions/ answers and reviews and couldn\'t quite sort out if they need to be seasoned. Apparently they don\'t. They use a cast-iron non-stick coating, according to the literature these come with. They do recommend using non-abrasive utensils and cleaning methods, although after weeks of heavy heavy use, these don\'t seem to scratch. Granted, I\'m not using metal or anything just in case, but still, my ceramic ones began scratching almost immediately.If you can believe it, these are even more non-stick than quality ceramic pans that cost three 4 times as much. Seriously absolutely nothing sticks to these. I flipped a really cheesy quesadilla poorly the other day, and a bunch of the cheese spilled out. Even with a thick layer of shredded cheese and some chicken, it just glided around the pan. I later did it on purpose because who doesn\'t love fried cheese? No oil or anything, and once it was properly fried on the bottom, it released no problem. The little bumps on the bottom of the pan also seem to really help with even temperature distribution. Everything I cook is cooked perfectly and evenly. There don\'t seem to be hotspots with these pans like there have been with every other type of pan I\'ve used. The texture on the bottom also creates a fun sear on things, with a bunch of little round circles.These seem to heat up more quiclky than cast iron, but maintain steady heat even better than cast iron. You don\'t need to heat these pans as hot as other pans, at least in my experience. They heat very quickly and while I used to use ""high"" on my stovetop frequently to get a good sear, even on my cast iron, with these they can burn things on high. It\'s a bit of a learning curve, but for whatever reason, these heat up more quickly and evenly than any other pan I\'ve used, so babysit your food when you\'re first using these to sort out the best cooking temperatures.Cleanup is so easy too. Per the care guidelines, I don\'t introduce extreme temperature differences, so let these pans cool for at least 15 minutes after use, and seriously running it quickly under water releases everything. Unlike traditional cast iron that rusts, I can leave these wet after and they air dry, with no rusting. They don\'t seem to hold onto grease, but just in case, I do use a little soap and a non-stick safe cleaning pad and rinse well after. They don\'t seem to hold onto stinky smells like fish either. These are much less porous than regular cast-iron. While heavy-duty, these are also significantly lighter than traditional cast iron too. My thin, weak wrists don\'t feel like they\'ll be dislocated moving these particular pots around.Finally, I do like that the handles are removable, but likely won\'t use that feature often. It\'s not that they\'re difficult to remove, but it does take a few steps and removing a screw (and hoping I don\'t lose it!) to do so. I\'ve removed the handles a couple of times when moving something from the stovetop to the oven, but prefer to leave the handles alone. I also wish they had lids, but it\'s not the end of the world that they don\'t. My skillet lids from a different set mostly work with these, so I can make it work on the rare occasions I need a lid. Tomato-based items don\'t seem to impact these either like they did my traditional cast iron.All in all, get these pans! Whether your a novice in the kitchen or highly experienced, you will love this set!

When I ran across this cast iron + enamel + nonstick + macro-texture surface set, I had to try them. VERY PLEASED so far. At this point, they have exceeded my expectations; appearance is excellent with the wood handles and the non-stick is impressive. Heavy ? Yea, but that is a bonus and not a shortcoming in my opinion. Durability ? Too soon to tell; it’s only been a month, but no problems so far. Heat transfer is good overall but a little slow (completely expected for CI) and they nicely brown everything I have thrown in them on med-low heat over a gas flame without major hotspots or any local burning. They do not give a completely even heat surface, but it’s pretty good and a very good compromise between cost and functionality. If I really get bored, I may get out the thermal imager and quantity what I already know by use.I would really like to see the set expand. No, not pots, there are already 100’s of functional small, med., large, and stock pots for boiling stuff where non-stick is almost irrelevant. On the stove, I could use a bigger / deeper pan with a helper handle and after that I think a griddle pan would also be nice in this set.Adding a non-stick surface to enameled cast-iron cookware is as obvious as putting butter on toast but surprisingly this is the first set I have seen with it ? Maybe I am an ignoramous ? Putting the textured surface in there is brilliant ! Thin wall cast iron is a fresh idea (as far as I know) also. Putting all this together at once is a lot.

I purchased this for a house member who really likes nonstick cookware. I ordered this one, because Cook\'s Illustrated America\'s Test Kitchen rated it the best. It\'s a very nice pan, and we have used it many times so far. The nonstick surface is holding up very well, and it is definitely nonstick. We have cooked eggs, meat, chicken, fish, and other items in it. Nothing stuck to the pan. We only hand wash it, and we only use non-metal utensils with it. The weight of the pan is good, and the handle is comfortable and ergonomic. All-in-all this is a great pan if you are looking for something nonstick.A side note about nonstick pans:I am generally not a fan of nonstick pans. I don\'t like cooking with something that is a part of planned obsolescence. All nonstick cookware slowly starts to wear down with use. It is just the nature of it. So, eventually all nonstick cookware has to be replaced, as eventually it will lose its nonstick properties. This brings me to the other part that I don\'t like. Nonstick cookware uses chemical products to make it nonstick, and those chemicals wind up in your food. Reports claim the chemicals are safe, but you have to judge your level of confidence in the reports. I don\'t see a benefit to having added chemicals in my food. Also, you can\'t use metal utensils with nonstick pans, as the metal will damage the nonstick coating. This generally means one set of non-metal cooking utensils and a separate set of metal utensils to use with your standard cookware. So, I have two sets of cooking utensils. Also, different nonstick cookware will have different maximum temperature ratings. This pan is rated up to 430 F degrees. If you go above that you breakdown the chemical nonstick coating, which not only ruins the nonstick coating, but it also puts those chemicals into your food. I once had a different brand of nonstick pan many years ago that I cooked an omelette in. The nonstick coating had broken down and left all sorts of black flakes on my omelette, so both the omelette and pan went into the garbage. Personally, I prefer to go with a high-quality, multi-clad, stainless steel set of pots & pans that I can use any utensils on that I like and will last me forever.

I am treating the new pans with kid gloves, making sure to only use non-stick coating safe utensils (wood or silicone). As well as thoroughly cleaning, and drying them after each use. Make sure to not use dish washing liquid that contains bleach or citrus additives as these will break down the non-stick coating.

Although that worked, the silicone edge tended to accumulate grease from the oil/butter used to cook the eggs and was difficult to keep clean. And so I was looking to obtain a new lid.Luckily the B08X6VQ6QS 10"" Ozeri Tempered Glass Fry Pan Lid (part number GL3-26) perfectly fits the 10"" Oxo Good Grips Pro frying pan. I measured the diameter of the Oxo 10"" pan at exactly 10.75"". The Ozeri lid is specified to be 10.7"" in diameter. This results in this lid being a perfect fit for the 10"" Oxo Good Grips Pro frying pan. The attached photos show what a great fit this lid is for the 10” Oxo Good Grips Pro frying pan.The silicone rim on the Ozeri lid is much smaller (only 0.5"") than on the general-purpose lids (1.5"" to 2.0""), and so I am hoping it will be easier to keep it grease free. One minor issue with this Ozeri lid is that the steam vents are on the side edges and not on top. This results in the lid getting “fogged” up a little bit more than those with the steam vent on the top. Hence visibility into the pan while cooking is a little bit less, but that is not a big deal since you can still generally see inside there.I did not purchase the B08X6CKMS8 8” Ozeri Tempered Glass Fry Pan Lid (part number GL3-20) but it is specified at 8.3” diameter. I have measured the 8” Oxo Good Grips Pro frying pan diameter at 8.3”, and so this lid should fit well.Note: the Ozeri lids are delivered with the knob put in backwards. This is done on purpose to create a lower profile lid for easier shipping. They even included a note saying as much, and that all you need to do is unscrew the knob as shipped and re-install it in the correct position.

Performed like a champ up until about 3 or 4 months ago, when its non-stick surface began breaking down. Now its half usable (surface area wise). Although, in reality its unusable, and should not be used, nor any pan, once the non-stick surface has been compromised for health reasons, I\'ve read.I\'ve decided to purchase another as the length of time before failure (as compared to other reviews) was not bad and all during its time, it performed great. It was also a breeze to clean, requiring very little effort.Things to take note and pay attention to are the other reviews that say how to use the pan, which I will state as well as they are, I feel, were key to its duration and performance.*Side note, I have an LG electric glass-top stove.DO NOT use high heat - I actually cut my heat level down by half or more in everything we cooked in the pan. I feel I should have been doing prior to this pan as its probably what warped my others over time that weren\'t as solid as this one. Out of the 10 levels, with increments our stove went to, the highest we went on our stove was 3.0. MAYBE 3.6 or 3.8 but rarely. I thought this was going to be too low and although took a little longer, not much, to get going, it was perfectly fine and had all the heat it needed. Most of the time we had it around 2.4-2.8. If I have had translate to a dial stove, then med to medium low(?). It does a good job of heating hence why, once it gets going, its good to go. You don\'t need the extra heat. It\'ll cook or boil. Again that\'s for our stove, so take it how you will. For trial and error, start on the low go up from there, but again, not too high.DO NOT use metal or even a hard plastic utensils. The surface does seem to scratch pretty easily. I feel we may have accidentally broken this rule a few times before catching ourselves, which probably contributed to shortening its life. This is why I\'m giving this pan another go. Definitely keep to wood or silicon spatulas, etc.DO NOT use brillo or other harsh scrubbing pads. If the pan is still performing well and needs that extra ""elbow"" grease try this tip first - Put some water in the pan, bring to a boil or just under (again, with a heat setting comparable to heat for cooking. NEVER high.) and then use your surface safe spatula or scraper to gently remove the food. This method will pop or break that stubborn seal the food has on the pan. This works 9 times out of 10 for any pan, I\'ve found.Hope this helps. I\'ll update my review depending on how the 2nd pan performs and trying to be extra diligent this time.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 14, 2022', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Premium non-stick pan at a reasonable price.', 'author': 'Amazon Customer', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'This was featured in America\'s Test Kitchen as their ""best value"" pick and I agree.

Part of that was due to the fact that my wife loved this pan so much, she used it all the time for everything, and non-stick pans will last longer if you only use them for applications where you really need a non-stick surface. NO non-stick surfaces last forever, however, which is why I think it\'s silly to spend a fortune on a non-stick pan. Of all the non-stick skillets I\'ve tried (including some of the expensive ones) T-fal has the best non-stick surface.Some notes, though. This pan did exhibit the ""hump"" in the middle of the cooking surface, but I still say the constant belly-aching over this is way overstated. It never affected the ability to cook anything I wanted to. If anything runs towards the edge, just give it a quick swirl – problem solved. It made great, thin omelets, even with the ""hump, until the non-stick surface wore out.However, this pan did warp. Just enough that it wouldn\'t lie perfectly flat on a ceramic cooktop. I think it had something to do with the construction. Although it conducts heat evenly, this is not a heavy duty pan. The stainless steel bottom is a thin disk mated to an aluminum body, which is different than more expensive pans that sandwich an aluminum disk between layers of stainless steel. The two metals expand and contract at different rates, so I think warping is inevitable with this design.Because of that, I opted for the Ultimate Anodized version of this pan for its replacement, which features solid anodized aluminum construction. Same non-stick surface. Same handle. I\'ve been very happy with it.If you have an induction cook-top, then this Professional version is your only option. It\'s a good pan. Just don\'t overheat it and maybe avoid super hot dishwasher cycles to make it last longer.(May, 2014) It\'s still pretty much brand new. So I can\'t comment on its durability, yet.The build quality is fine. I prefer a slightly longer handle and ones with the slip-on silicone sleeves, but it\'s fine. This pan is oven-safe, but only at less than 400 degrees. But this pan is not made for super-hot cooking - no non-stick pans are. It\'s not a super heavy pan, but it\'s not super thin like so many cheap ones. But the purpose is to quickly heat things up, and it does so evenly. Mine did not exhibit the ""bow"" that some complain about. Even if it does bow slightly over time and the oil runs to the sides, I\'m not concerned. With a non-stick skillet, you are adding fat strictly for flavor. A quick swirl is all that\'s necessary when you add the food.(Note: If you actually watch ATK like I do, you would see that their skillet actually DOES exhibit the bow and their oil runs to the sides. Doesn\'t seem to stop them from making great food, so I think the bellyaching over this is a bit overstated)If you are adding more than, say, a tablespoon of oil, you probably need to use a different pan, anyway. You should be using this pan to cook quickly sauté veggies or cook delicate foods like fish and eggs, not to cook burgers and steaks or simmer foods for a long time. Use stainless steel or cast iron for those things.The non-stick surface is excellent. Omelets are a breeze. Fish releases easily and intact while still getting a little color. To make the surface last as long as possible, hand washing is best, and cleanup is easy.This is more than I\'ve spent on a non-stick skillet in the past - I usually just buy inexpensive commercial non-stick pans from restaurant supply companies. But the America\'s Test Kitchen tests and reviews seem to suggest that this one will put up with a little more abuse and retain it\'s excellent non-stick properties longer than most. I can\'t comment on that yet, but I haven\'t seen the non-stick properties of any of these skillets last longer than a year - or two, at best. Dings and scratches are normal wear-and-tear, unless you really baby these things, - always hand wash them, always use soft utensils (wood and silicone are best - hard plastic can still scratch the surface), and store them in a way that the non-stick surface never contacts any other surfaces.This skillet does the types of cooking it was made for extremely well. That\'s why you should buy it.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 5, 2014', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars I will never buy another brand of pots and pans again...', 'author': 'SFG Electronics', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'These are the best pots/pans I have ever used! This particular one I actually purchased as a gift for my mom, but I have completely switched all of my pots and pans to the T-Fal E series. I have yet to cook (or burn) anything that actually stuck to the surface and couldn\'t just be wiped out. FOR EXAMPLE: I occasionally make sandwiches for my family, and one thing that I do is throw deli meat (whether it\'s turkey, ham, salami, etc.) in the pan to heat it up and give it a slight crispiness, and top it with cheese (processed, shredded, real cheese, whatever we have at the time). I will then flip it over to ""toast"" the cheese side. Again, the cheese releases from the surface as good as the meat does, and this gives it a little smoky flavor that adds to the overall taste. This is by far the best non-stick pan I have ever used!PROS: Incredibly non-stick No harmful chemicals in the coating (does NOT contain PTFE (Teflon) Super easy to clean Lightweight, but solid Has a color changing circle in the center to let you know when it\'s hot Retains a considerable amount of heat (you can cook the same with less heat from the burner)CONS: Does not hold up to use with metal utensils -- have to use silicone-coated or plastic Made of aluminum -- this contributes to the light weight, but is soft and dents/bends easily if not properly cared for Lids are not readily available (T-Fal does not make them)After about 2 1/2 years of near daily use, this particular pan became ""sticky"" due to improper care (the non-stick surface became VERY scratched, down to metal in some spots), but this is not a fault of the pan. It could have easily been prevented.I cook just about every meal for my family, and after using this I would never switch to a different brand or series of pots and pans. But, like any high-quality item, they must be properly cared for.SUGGESTIONS: ALWAYS wash by hand, do NOT put in dishwasher!! (This should be self-explanatory, it takes approximately 30 seconds to completely clean by hand). For me, washing consists of a rinse under hot water, a simple wipe (NO SCRUBBING NEEDED) with either a soapy soft-sponge or cloth, followed by a hot water rinse and towel dry. DONE! NEVER heat pan with nothing in it!! (Even though it is non-stick, you should always add a little oil/butter or whatever you are cooking to the pan while heating). This prevents the pan from overheating. DO NOT overheat!! Overheating the pan causes the coating to ""scorch"" and will greatly reduces it\'s effectiveness. ALWAYS use plastic or silicone-coated utensils, as metal utensils WILL damage the surface. Pay attention to your cooking temperature! The design of these pans allow you to get a better cook in the same amount of time with less heat on the burner! For example, I can boil water with the burner set at 6 in the same amount of time that it takes an aluminum or stainless pot to boil with the burner on 9 or 10. Frying (say, eggs or burgers) can be done on 4 or 5, whereas other pans need to be on 7 or 8. **YOU\'RE SETTINGS MAY DIFFER!! EVERY STOVETOP CAN PRODUCE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF HEAT!!**I have used everything from cheap ceramic-coated non-stick to very expensive (and overpriced, if you ask me) PROFESSIONAL stainless steel cookware, and nothing I have used in the past can even begin to compare with the quality of this series of pots and pans by T-Fal.

The new 12"" had the hump (about 1/16 inch tall). I put a star back because in practice very few items have a problem with cooking on the hump and though every indication is t-fal is backpeddling on trying to say it\'s on purpose that is obviously not true if it\'s not always. ""We purposely make SOME of them domed"". My 10"" is perfectly flat.As promised and only 4mo. after getting my new 12"" I developed a new way to flatten the pan: one step and worked like a charm.How\'d I do it? Drove over it with my SUV. NOT KIDDING check out the photos.I was trying to figure out a fool proof method somebody could copy using on-hand items.Items:➀ sawdust or kitty litter etc➁ sheet of plywood about 18"" square➂ several ""drive over boards"" (3/4 plywood about the width of your car tire good)➃ some bricks or 2x limber cut to size➄ small pieces of plywood cut to size as neededAs the last photos show, clips from my movie, I put sawdust down in a circle under the pan, slightly concave in the middleI put the 18"" square of 1/2 plywood over the sawdustI put the pan on that sheetI assembled a ramp from bricks and plywood to get car tire over the lip of pan.I put a square of 2x4 on top of a 4"" square of 1/2"" thick plywood to do the pressing.I drove over using front wheel for more weight.I stopped for a second or two centered on pan and drove off.My dome dropped 58/1000 on one pass and the flat c-channel I used for flat reference shows nearly perfectly flat after and a test with some soapy water shows absolutely zero ""moat"" effect. 100% solved!For whatever reason my 10"" model was perfectly flat out he gate so no fix needed.For naysayers that drank the t-fal koolaid: in addition to the problems of food like crepes and eggs being hard to cook: flat top stoves lose about 80% of their conductive heat transfer when only touching on the outer edges so it makes for uneven cooking which is my primary motivation for fixing my ONE AND ONLY EVER domed pan.Original review:As many have noted: the pan may actually be the holy grail of non stick but the ego stamped on the bottom makes for a mini mountain in the centre of the pan.Wheat happens is that you will get a ""moat"" of oil around the center island of dry in the center of the pan. Nice if you want to make donut shaped crépes I suppose. Not super nice for anything else.QC so ""out of whack"" for a top tier vendor like t-fal is inexcusable. Somebody should be fired literally.Is it too much to ask that the flat bottom of a pan is flat without having to fix it yourself? Yeesh!The good news: easy to fix. I\'ve used the trick of standing in a pan on carpet to un-mound a dozen pans in then past, and a similar trick worked on this pan.Then trick: the thick aluminum bottom was more robust than the pans I\'ve fixed in the past so i used a slightly different method:I formed a donut shape with a rolled up towel and set the pan on it, then I stepped inside and while standing on the ball of my foot I lunged up and down ""hopping but keping foot On the ground"".I checked for flatness with a ruler both outside and inside until I was satisfied. In the end, two teaspoons of water with a tiny bit of dish soap to ""wet"" the surface spread edge to edge, no island. Also 1 1/2 tbsp. of oil once heated filled the bottom of the pan perfectly. (When cold it puddled in the center and stayed).So, ""A"" for non stick, ""D"" for putting a hill in the center of every pan by stamping a logo in without the proper compensation in the blank or the very least a follow up stamp to make the pan flat and some friggin\' quality control!Ok, so after 1-2 minutes of hopping up and down, the hump in the middle went from nearly 1mm tall (about 1/4 the thickness of the metal to put that into perspective) down to about a 0.2mm dent in the bottom and darn near perfectly flat inside. (There are a couple areas maybe 0.1mm shallow inside, enough to take maybe 0.1 tsp of liquid but inconsequential. The fact the bottom still has a shallow when the top is flat means the stamping process (for the logo) is making the metal thinner in the center in addition to making the little hill.Love the pan and can\'t wait to get some cooking done and a follow-up if the fix is relatively permanent.I\'ll post pics when I get a chance.-awrupdate: so i got to try it out, and freakeshly non-stick; was so easy to cook crepes in this pan! especially with the thermo-dot. It turns color just a little too hot for perfect crepes but they were amazing and tasty; and just slid out of the pan!I ended up having to re-level my stove before i could really test the flattened out fixed copy, but with only 2 tsp of oil to lightly oil the pan (probably not even remotely needed for these crepes), there were just random spots of oil; it doesn\'t want to adhere to the pan enough to make a coating.I have a neat picture of 2 tsp of oil just sitting in a puddle in the dead-center of the pan while heating. I also was able to make an \'oil moat\' just about 3/8"" wide around the entire pan at one point, so there is still a little bit of a \'low spot\' or perhaps just the fact there is a bend in the pan gives the oil something to grab onto.Now if i can only get my wife to stop using metal instruments and get the pan to last a while.considering it was 1/3 to 1/4 the price of a decent tri-ply pan the same size, this pan in spite of its hiccups is a home-run.-awr', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States March 1, 2013', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great pan great price', 'author': 'JEN', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""Finally bought myself a new frying pan after probably a decade and I'm so glad I picked this one.

We\'ve had an older 622-24 for several years now (over 5) and my wife wanted to get a new one because the old one had been scratched up enough that the non stick coating wasn\'t working as good as it once did, plus she just likes things that look new. I first went to TJ Max because sometimes you can get good stuff there for much less and found the pan that looked identical, but with a different part number on the pan. I wanted to see how different the cheaper pan from TJ Max was and bought it for comparison, but will be returning that pan because the one with part number 622-24 to me seems like a better pan and worth the extra $9. Just looking at them side by side you can\'t tell a difference, but when I weighed them the 622-24 pan purchased on Amazon was a little heavier. (34.53 oz versus 32.35 oz) The 622-24 seems like it is also just a smidge thicker when looking at them side by side. The main thing I noticed was the pan from Amazon has a label on the pan itself that says Quantanium which is supposed to be a premium coating so you can use metal utensils with the skillet. The one from TJ Max doesn\'t say that or has the sticker. The packaging sleeve with all the marketing material is similar and goes over all the same features, but have different presentations. The main Title difference is the 622-24 has ""Chef\'s"" in the title were the other does not which I\'m assuming is because of the added Quantanium coating and reason the pan is a little over 2 oz more in weight. So now that you know that lets talk about the 622-24 pan performance. It has been a trusted skillet we\'ve used for over 5 years and has impressed us enough to purchase another one to replace the one we use all the time nearly every day. I contemplated trying the new Ninja Cookware, but it is more money and figured I\'d stay with what we know and what we\'ve used for years so we don\'t have to change our cooking routines. We still use the old pan, but not for delicate items or items were we think it will be difficult to clean afterwards. The nonstick coating holds up well, but the pan will scratch over time despite the Quantanium marketing addition. The pan has a nice weight and look to it, but not as nice as other higher priced pans. Heat distribution is good too and will evenly cook an egg quickly and evenly. I do believe the cheaper pan from TJ Max will do just as good, but may not last as long. That is strictly my opinion though as I haven\'t cooked with it. I did want to add one more thing regarding my purchase on Amazon for the 622-24 pan I purchased. When it came in it had a scratch on the side rim of the non stick coating. Considering it will likley get a scratch like that in the future I decided to keep it instead of requesting a replacement, but did contact customer service and they were willing to give me a small discount on the pan because of the scratch which I am very appreciative of and also why I try to purchase everything from Amazon, because their customer service is really second to none in that respect. Well over 95% of the time they have met or went above my expectations with any issue I\'ve ever had with anything. The key is to report it to them as quickly as possible. Hope this review helped someone and gave many the difference between the two pans because beforehand I couldn\'t find any info on the 6622-24PP skillet from TJ Max.

The handles are hefty and sturdy, the bottom is weighted and balanced nicely to sit very still while lightly stirring with one hand on a glass top or induction surface. This pan heats evenly and quickly and holds temperature surprisingly well when large cuts of cold meat or food enter the pan.This makes short work of sauteeing, simmering, braising, and just about anything other regular household cooking duties you can throw at it. Being dishwasher safe makes it even better, once the visible food particles have been sprayed or cleaned off this thing can just be popped right in the dishwasher to save tedious scrubbing that nobody wants to do after a meal. Comes out of a regular dishwasher cycle looking brand new.The only downside, and this isn't even really a huge deal but is just worth mentioning in case someone has delicate or sensitive skin on their hands, is the fact that the very outer lip edge of the pan appears to be slightly squared/angled instead of polished or ground to a smooth edge. The very edge of the lip is noticeably sharp to the touch, not enough to actually cut skin but it is uncomfortable to run your bare hand or finger over the lip of the pan while cleaning. Good thing the handles on this are top notch and minimize the amount of times you will ever realistically need to touch the edge of the pan itself. Minor detail, but it feels a little unfinished on the edge compared with how smooth and nice the texture of the handles, exterior, and interior of the actual pan are.Overall for the price point this is a no-brainer to pick up for a great all-purpose pan.

I had to even heat it up with a torch to remove it. But other than that it is a great wok. it heats nicely, cooks well, and is like any cast iron I have to care for. seasoning is a must. I got some done on my stovetop but w/o a gas range, you can\'t do the upper portion of it without burning off the bottom coatings. I am replacing a hammered Carbon steel wok that the handles burned off seasoning it in the oven a few times over 20 years.

Have used it several dozen times.Will it wear out in a few years? Maybe. If so, I\'ll buy another without complaints. If they only rented this pan for $10/year, I\'d sign a lifelong agreement, it\'s that good.This is an awesome pan, and no matter what else you own, spring for $20 and change and get one of these. Great price for gifting, too, which I\'m considering right now.This is my go-to pan now, and I only pick another if I need bigger or want cast iron. Otherwise, this is it. You can NOT go wrong. Silicone handle means it doesn\'t get hot and can go in the oven up to 400°. The metal tip at the end does not get hot on the stove, although the metal part of the handle right next to the pan does. So you do have to be a little careful.The only thing that would make me up my rating to 5.5 stars is if the silicone handle extended another 1/2"" or so closer to the pan, but then it would be exposed to gas flames and might melt, or whatever silicone does when it\'s overheated. But the silicone part is big enough for my hand; just be normally cautious and you\'ll be fine. I wasn\'t once and I didn\'t burn myself much, just an annoyance that taught me to be a little more careful.Eggs for one or two people are what this pan is perfect for.It is the only pan I\'ve ever owned that I considered more than just a utilitarian pan. This is a work of art. The color, the weight, the balance, the handle, the temperature tolerance. I guess that\'s both art and engineering. Even if you don\'t need the pan, buy one and use it as a coffee table conversation piece.One last practical comment. If you own an infrared thermometer, I encourage you to use it the first few times you use the pan to see how hot you\'re getting it based on your burner settings. Then you shouldn\'t have to worry about it. The pan is so small that it will heat up fast and hot, and you could go over the 500° limit if you went to high heat and weren\'t cooking much in it. No reason at all to destroy this pan if you use a little common sense. The 400° limit for traditional Teflon was one I never seemed to be able to stay within, and I cooked many a Teflon pan in the past. This Dupont Autograph 2 coating is wonderful and should last years if you don\'t abuse it.Oh, and if you don\'t own an infrared thermometer, why not? Amazon has them as cheap as a dozen bucks. I can\'t attest to how good one would be that\'s that cheap, but do your research. I bought a Maverick on here a couple years ago for $38 and it\'s been one of the best purchases I\'ve ever made. It\'s extremely accurate; I have a Thermapen and have tested both with ice water and boiling water and the Maverick is within 1° accuracy (Thermapen is obviously the gold standard here and it was right on as well). It\'ll pay for itself by helping you avoid ruining food and pans in the kitchen, and will let you run around the house checking temperatures of walls, furniture, whatever. You\'ll be able to better balance your heating system by adjusting vents. You\'ll be able to test sleeping people to be sure they\'re still alive. And the laser beam is great entertainment for pets.

Then I took some oil, I usually use flaxseed oil, but was out so I used grapeseed oil and put a thin coat all over the pan with a lint free cloth. You could use any high smoke point oil you want. Then I preheated my oven to 400 degrees and put the pan inside upside down. Let it sit in there for an hour and turned the oven off. I let it rest in there overnight until the next day when it was cool and did the same thing, this time at 350 degrees. The next day I did the same thing one more time at 350 degrees.And now the skillet is really smooth top and bottom, and is re-seasoned, top and bottom. Nothing sticks to it, heat distribution is great because it's cast iron, and I can use it for virtually anything that I want to cook. And it goes from stove to oven without worrying about damaging the skillet.The thing is every time after you cook you have to clean it, without soap! Put it on the stovetop on medium heat to make sure you totally dry it off, get rid of the water! And while it's really warm want to put a quarter-size spot of oil on the bottom and take a lint free cloth and coat the inside on the skillet with that oil. This is called seasoning your cast iron skillet and it must be done every time after you use it!First few months I'll be using non-stick cookware on it until it gets a really good coating of seasoning on it. After that I could use metal cookware but for the meantime I'm just going to use nonstick cookware to protect that coating. If you re-season the cast iron skillet this way if it will have a bronze color when you're done seasoning, this is to be expected! It will get darker in time if the more you use it and the more you season it. You can look on YouTube and find many tutorials on re-season a cast iron skillet this way.If you take care of this pan it can last you a lifetime, or more, you can pass it down to your kids."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 21, 2021', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars One of the best cast irons I’ve had.', 'author': 'Rivers717', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I have about 6 cast irons and this by far is still my favorite!

The pictures in the listing look smaller then actual skillet is when you open the box. It amazingly looks just like a large size iron skillet. It's well made and importantly has a true flat bottom that so far after making pancakes, bacon and eggs, hamburgers, 3 cheese and hamburger dinner and fried pork chops in hasn't warped, burned the food or had food stuck so bad that I had to use a plastic scrapper to scrape it out of the pan with afterward. When hubby cooks he doesn't understand that not everything needs to be cooked on high! The nonstick coating is even over the entire pan and shows no signs so far of peeling, chipping, scratching or bubbling but I threaten everyone with their life if they put any utensils in my pots and pans that aren't wooden, heat resistant plastic or silicone. This baby is bigger then you'd expect and I love the straight sides so no more slopping out food as your stirring it. I swear this pan feels and looks as big as some of my 12 inch chicken fryer skillets. Love that it also has a nice glass lid with silicone covering both the lid knob and the skillet handle although in my opinion they should have also covered the helping handle with it because it gets really hot and could cause you to burn your hand if you get in a hurry and forget to grab a potholder. I like the helping handle especially with this size pan because it'll get pretty heavy when your cooking a big meal. This skillet will hold an amazing amount of food so you could feed a large family with it. It's super easy to clean, just a bit of dawn and wash with a soft dishcloth or sponge. Speaking of sponge, the skillet comes with a nice terrycloth covered sponge on one side and a soft silver scrubby on the other side and it has a loop so you can hang it to dry with so no ugly germs growing on it before it gets dry and you can throw it in the dishwasher or washing machine and dryer if you like. The manufactures also nicely provide you with a screwdriver and enough extra screws and lock washers so that you can replace the screw on the handle and the lid knob twice plus one extra if you ever loose all the screws. The only thing you have to put on once you open the box is the handle and it only takes one screw so It literally take a minute to have it ready to wash and cook with. It comes well packed and promptly delivered. So far I haven't made anything that has stuck to my skillet and even though this skillet and lid are dishwasher safe I will opt to just wash mine in the sink since it's so easy and fast to wash. We have hard water which leaves white spots on black silicone plus I've found that dishwasher detergent seems to over time fade black or dark colored silicone and I'd rather keep my cooking pots and pans with silicone looking new as long as possible. I'd give this skillet a 10 star rating if I could. I can't tell you how many pots and pans over the many years I've been cooking that I have been utterly disappointed in but this baby looks, feels and cooks like a good quality product and I'd be willing to bet it will outlast some of the big named cookware on the market to day. Oh yeah the reason I bought this product was because it was affordable, it was the size I wanted, it had the straight sides I wanted, it looked like it had a true flat bottom, it had way more good customer reviews then bad ones, and most importantly I wanted to be able to cook on both my radiant halogen cooktop and my induction hotplate, the kids got me for Christmas a year ago and only had one pot that came with it to cook with on it. By the way this skillet lives up to their advertising, it really works great on my induction hotplate. I tried to find a skillet that you could use on both an induction hotplate and my radiant halogen cooktop. While I found several skillets that stated you could use their skillet on both radiant and induction cooking surfaces I found that in the reviews very few of them actually worked on customers induction hotplates or induction stove tops. Put your mind at rest this one works great on both as well as coil and gas. NOW for the cons on this skillet, They really need to also cover the helping handle with silicone because sooner or later someone will forget to grab a potholder and get burned. It heats evenly but does heat and little hotter where the burner is under the skillet although the sides are only slightly less hot then the center so this is not a big deal. The skillet takes a little bit more time to reach temperature then thinner cheaper skillets do but this isn't a deal breaker either. It's heavier then other skillets of the same size but not that much heavier and nowhere near as heavy as an iron skillet. They don't tell you that you can cook with it in the oven but I'm pretty sure it wouldn't be a problem as long as you don't bake over 400 degrees and never use it under a broiler at all or have your racks close the the heating element either lower or higher ones. I'm going to buy another one of these skillets before the company figures out what a great skillet they have and decides to raise their price to match the big named companies prices. I highly recommend this skillet to anyone who is looking for a good quality skillet with tall straight sides, a flat bottom that doesn't warp when hot, scratch resistant coating, a breeze to clean, can handle a meal for two or to feed a small army all at a very reasonable price, works and looks like an iron skillet.

(Probably not necessary, but I'd rather throw that stuff in the trash than run it down the drain.) When the pan is cool, I set it in the sink, add a few drops of dish liquid, fill it with water, and let it set for a while.

I looked for a pan that was not Teflon that had some thickness and looked like it might last. I also wanted a pan that was guaranteed food safe.This pan is thick and sturdy, and it heats evenly. It is raised very slightly from the outside towards the center, which has both pros and cons, but the raised middle is so slight that it is barely noticeable, and I would not hesitate to cook an omellete in it. It does let the grease drain towards the outside of the pan rather than staying under the food, which it nice. I like the glass cover that lets me see food as it cooks, and it is about as easy to clean as any other glass lid.One caution: the directions say to never use the pan above medium heat, and I have been careful not to do that. Even on medium, the pan heats quickly and gets hot enough, and I have found that at medium temperature the pan cooks very evenly without burning or scorching. However, my gas stove does not have a really high flame or get as hot as some other gas stoves even on the burner with the highest btu, and people with stoves that get really hot will need to be very careful and might need to use low heat rather than medium to avoid damage to the pan. It will depend upon individual stoves. So far, nothing sticks, although I have not tried really sticky cheese yet. It cleans up very nicely with soap and water, and I have not had to scrub it. Time will tell whether or not that lasts.The handle is wood look-alike, and it stays cool when cooking on a stove top. It is very wide - especially where it joins the pan - which makes the pan steadier to hold and pour with less strain on my hand and wrist and without slipping or over-tipping.The only reason for 4 stars is that I personally find this pan kind of ugly because of the speckling and the light-colored wood look-alike handle.

Update: 12/16/23', 'author': 'Granny Gems', 'rating': 3, 'content': ""Pro: I wanted to replace my 8 quart black Circulon Stockpot I'd own for 14 years as it was looking worn out from weekly use. It came with a great glass lid that felt snug and also fit a skillet that wasn't the same brand, but came in handy. It still works great and my friend has already said he would like it to make chili in larger quantities. That's how durable it has been for me, although it is quite a bit heavier than the new 10 quart gray stockpot that I received. I can see that my new one is lighter because the metal edges are much thinner now, but the larger lid that comes with it is still a very snug fit. Unfortunately, it is too big for any of my other cookware now, but I appreciate how much easier it is to lift it and yet holds more for when I make food for potlucks to share with the community. I had to rearrange my cookware in order to fit this larger pot more easily in my tiny kitchen, but that was fine since I only have room for one stockpot. The description of the new one looks identical on the inside, but not on the bottom, so I will have to update my review after using it for at least a month as to how durable it is compared to my old black one. It's not a whole lot of difference in size, but I can fit the older one inside the larger one up to the handles without the lids on and still have a 1/4 inch gap on all sides. I wouldn't recommend that to avoid scratching both, but mention it to indicate the slight size difference.Con: I don't have any at this point, so I've rated it a 4 until I've tested it out on cooking spinach, cream cheese, spaghetti, sauces, ground turkey sausage, beans for chili, and such. I don't use metal utensils, and prefer to use silicone covered spatulas, spoons, and tongs with metal inside of them for strength and length of tools that reach all the way down to keep the food moving. Keep the heat on lower to medium temperatures to minimize the need to prevent scorching and to protect from scratches. I don't have a dishwasher, so hand washing is all I can comment on as to durability. Hope that helps folks decide if this stockpot is for you. I'm happy to recommend it as it meets my needs just fine. UPDATED!! Not pleased with the bottom of this stockpot because it doesn't have the same grid type on it that protected it from scratching on the electric stove! It heats well just like the older one, but now it is subject to scratching on the bottom of the pot because they no longer use the grid on the bottom.

Works as intended, efficient and non-stick.', 'author': 'Good Reviews', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Amazon won\'t allow separate reviews for multiple sizes, so both the 5.5"" egg pan and the 10"" skillet with lid are reviewed here. --The 5.5"" egg pan is big enough to cook two eggs or a large patty or three links. Thermal performance: The pan heats up to full cooking temperature quickly and does a good job maintaining that on the medium heat setting. Non-stick: I always use a little oil/butter to get food started, but the non-stick coating and reasonable turning times work well to keep food from sticking. Cleaning: Cleaning is easy, although the top rim and underside need a little special care to keep clean and preserve the pan\'s quality without causing abrasion during cleaning. The low sides make it easy to pour food out. The handle provides plenty of control and heat insulation. The pan is smooth, well-finished.--10"" Skillet with Lid: This pan is big enough to cook about four servings of meat and vegetables. Thermal performance: The pan seems to take longer than I expected to heat up to full cooking temperature, but the lid helps shorted that time, and once reaches the desired temperature, it does a good job maintaining that. This might be due to the decently-thick bottom clad. The sides certainly do eventually get hot and help cook larger volumes, even on the medium heat setting. Non-stick: I always use a little oil/butter to get food started, but the non-stick coating and reasonable turning times work well to keep food from sticking. Cleaning: Cleaning is easy, although the top rim and underside need a little special care to keep clean and preserve the pan\'s quality without causing abrasion during cleaning. Design: I wish there were more curvature of the sidewalls to the bottom, since it would help pour food out easier than this angled version does, but on the other hand this design reduces as much slosh and splash when stirring or moving food around. The handle provides plenty of control. The lid fits well. The handle can get hot enough to require the use of a pad, etc. to hold when lifting. Finish: The pan is almost entirely well-finished and polished, with a few exceptions. The hollow handle exhibits sheet metal edges which have not been ground and polished finely, thus leaving the feel of a sharp edge. There is a slight risk of laceration during handling, especially in cleaning and storing, although it would take a quick or forceful action of the hand or fingers to cause injury. Otherwise, there are very slightly rough areas left around the upper rims of the rivets on the pan and lid.

I can't believe I spent so many years of my life without a cast iron pan. Fact is, I just never understood how easy these are to cook with and maintain. Yes, you have to season it. Yes, that takes a little getting used to at first. No, it's not hard and really doesn't take much time to maintain. It's much easier than I thought it would be, and I love the way my food comes out!Once properly seasoned, this pan is as non-stick as any other pan I've ever used. I did the initial seasoning in my gas grill. That way you don't fill your kitchen with smoke. You can certainly use a regular oven if you don't have a grill. Give it a good 2-3 seasonings before using it to cook. There are plenty of articles and videos online explaining how to season a cast iron pan.As for the cooking, if you haven't used cast iron, you don't know what you're missing. The heat distribution and retention are amazing. For best results, make sure to pre-heat to your desired temp for several minutes before adding oil or food. Cooking with oil also helps maintain the non-stick surface, so the surface improves the more you use the pan. I've used this for steaks, fried/scrambled eggs, bacon, arepas, and shepherd's pie. I find myself looking for more recipes I can use it for. I haven't tried using it on my gas grill yet, but I'm eager to try. This thing makes me want to cook more!I like the 12-in size, though many people may prefer the 10.25-in version. I can prepare a NY Strip and a Fillet in this pan at the same time, with room to spare for a butter baste. It's a bit large for a 3-egg scramble, but still works well.The one down-side is the weight. You're not likely to flip an omelet with this puppy, unless you have very strong wrists. Of course, that's not specific to this brand - it's a cast iron thing. Maybe the 10.25-in version would be easier to handle for some purposes. That said, this pan feels like it's going to last for generations to come.Oh, and if it seems like I'm being sponsored by Lodge, please know that I'm not.

According to what I had read online, that would let the bacon render, prevent curling, and make sure it wouldn’t stick. When it was time to flip the strips over, I learned that they were pretty much adhered to the pan. I had to scrape it up in little bits.Refusing to be defeated by a pan, I carefully cleaned it with hot water and scrubbed to get off all the stuck bits. Then, I followed the directions to do the stove top seasoning method two times. Once it was cooled all the way, I decided on a major test. I cooked four more strips of center-cut bacon, two over easy eggs, and a kimchi pancake for supper. NOTHING stuck! Everything came out of the pan looking like it had been prepared for a magazine photo article. I waited for the pan to cool down completely, took it to the sink, and rinsed it with hot water. Then, I wiped it dry with a paper towel before giving it a rub down with a nearly non-existent coat of canola oil. It is now sitting on the stove waiting for my next adventure.I am 100% satisfied with this skillet so far. I do caution other buyers to just pretend it is not “pre-seasoned” and season it. These are the instructions I followed:Seasoning your cast iron skillet on the stovetop is a simple process that builds up a protective layer of polymerized oil, making it naturally non-stick and preventing rust. Here's a quick guide:What you'll need:Your cast iron skilletHigh smoke point oil like canola, grapeseed, or avocado oilPaper towelsTongs (optional)Steps:Wash and dry your skillet. Scrub away any food residue with warm water and dish soap. Rinse thoroughly and dry completely with paper towels or heat it on the stovetop over low heat for a few minutes to evaporate any remaining moisture.Heat the skillet over medium heat. Let it get nice and hot for about 5 minutes.Pour in a thin layer of oil. About 1 tablespoon should be enough for a 12-inch skillet. Tilt the pan to coat the bottom and sides evenly.Wipe out the excess oil. Use a paper towel to spread the oil around the pan in a thin, even layer. You don't want any pooling oil.Heat the oil until it smokes. This takes about 2-3 minutes. Keep an eye on it and adjust the heat if necessary to avoid burning the oil.Turn off the heat and let the pan cool. The oil will polymerize as it cools, creating the seasoned layer.Repeat steps 3-6 two or three more times. Each layer builds upon the previous one, creating a stronger and more durable seasoning.Wipe away any excess oil and store your skillet. Once the pan is cool, use a paper towel to wipe away any remaining oil.

I've figured out that it took 20 minutes for the first side to get done and then flipping it over for 10 minutes for the second side.However, I noticed with this new frying pan, it started burning after 10 minutes and flipped it over and the second side started to burn after 5 minutes so it only took 1/2 of the time to make my sausage pattie.This was a pain because I always had time to wash my potato and shred it for the hashbrowns, get out all the ingredients for the French toast and scrambled eggs before I even needed to flip the sausage pattie but today, I really had to bust my butt to get everything else ready.Grabbing the lid handle was easy with the silicone coating since my old frying pan had a glass lid with a glass handle and the handle would get really hot.Hashbrowns also cooked in 1/2 of the time and they stuck a little bit because I forgot how fast the sausage pattie cooked so the hashbrowns also cooked much faster.The French toast also stuck but only a little but I kept close to them flipping them after 2 minutes.The scrambled eggs also only took about 3 minutes instead of about 5 minutes.Haven't cleaned the large frying pan since it's still hot and wanted to get this out right away.Now, what I don't like about these is the steamer pan because it only fits about 1/3 of the way into the medium sauce pan instead of all the way down. I was really hoping to use it like a strainer for making spaghetti so I didn't need to get the large colander out to drain the spaghetti.I was hoping to boil the spaghetti right in the steamer pan and pull it right out draining all the water at the same time.Other than the steamer pan, I really like the feel, weight, and sturdiness of these pans so far but I've only used the large frying pan and lid.

I have not seen any riveted pans that are NSF certified, due to bacteria/food being difficult to clean, especially with dishwasher-only process. There's no good reason not to weld the handles, or attaching hardware, other than maybe being cheaper? It's nice to use a spatula and cleanly swipe the inside of the pan to get what you're cooking off the sides....rivets prevent that. The removable handle(s) are a nice touch. I have never had any issues with the nuts or attachment process. Maybe some people did but could be a defect in the threads, or overtightening. Put a drop of oil on the threads before tightening, and lift the handle up and down while final-tightening, which allows a completely solid connection, which I have never had loosen. BTW, the thread is a 5mmx.8mm common metric thread, so if you lose a nut (they give you extras) you can buy them on amazon. Some pans have the handle permanently welded to the pan but I like the removable feature, allowing storage in tight areas, or I sometimes keep it off and use the pan like a pie pan to bake with, and the handle being off, makes it less cumbersome in the oven. If you make skillet-browned cornbread, this works almost as well as a cast iron skillet. There are no lids with this but the price is great, and you can buy lids, or if you're like me, you already have lids that fit these saute pans. The lip of these pans are flared out, making pouring liquid/stew/etc out clean with no drips down the side of the pan. I measured temperatures across the bottom of the pan while heating on an induction cooktop. The temperature was very uniform across the interior, and the magnetic coupling to the induction coils was very efficient, indicating a good magnetic stainless steel used in the mfg process. To season the pan, I use either coconut oil, or avacado oil (not spray oil, as the lecithin used for release agent will break down under high heat). So heat the pan to around 400F (after first cleaning it), then wipe the oil to coat the pan's inside with a paper towel and oven mitten(s). This will greatly reduce sticking. So to recap, great pan, flat bottom, great handle and attachment hardware, easy to clean and use. Price is also very good for high quality pans.

I am no chef and I purchased this for home use. I do however have a professional background as a food and beverage manager, and do know my way around a kitchen :) To be honest, whether this works for you will primarily depend on two things 1) Your expectations, and 2) The type of stove that you have or primarily use (Gas, Exposed Heating Element/Electric Coil, Induction, Glass Top with Enclosed Heating Element). ""Even Heat Distribution"" will depend not only on the pan, but also the type of stove and the size of the burner. So when reading reviews, look at the reviews using the same stove type that you will be cooking with :) I like and prefer induction, but at the moment I have a glass top with enclosed elements. I find that the pan heats up alright, but will be a bit slower than with gas or induction. For home use, I find this pan to work just fine :) The materials, finish, handle, comfort and heft (solidity) are all better than I had expected in this price range. I think this is a terrific value at this price point. Please note that as this is stainless steel, it will clean differently than a ""non stick"" type of pan :) Also, it feels very solid, and has the weight to back it up, so it is significantly heavier than a ""non stick"" pan. So if you might not have the hand, wrist or arm strength for heavy items, this may not be the right choice for you (this would not be a good choice for my 75+ yr old mother.) Also, this will not fit your needs if you want a ""branded"" pan with snob appeal or status benefits. (Those pans can cost 300% and 400% more). Lastly, it\'s impossible to speak of durability with new purchases. So, what\'s the bottom line here? I really think that most people with appropriate expectations will really like this pan! It will do its job well, and will look good and feel good in your hand while doing it! And it feels like it will last for years to come. Can you spend more on a pan? Yes. If you are a regular person, do you need to? No. I can afford to buy a more expensive pan if I wish, but there is no need to.

There is some discoloration after cooking however I read it is normal and doesn't affect the food and can be removed with some elbow grease(there are plenty of tutorials online how).The rivetless design is a nice addition and one I don't see in many stainless pans. The pan has a nice weight to it giving it a high-end feel. I personally really like the handle, It feels very comfortable in my hand and I can get a good grip, I was able to install it with no issues.In summary, my initial review is that this stainless steel pan offers really good performance and at its price point it is a great value.

When I first removed the cookware from the set, I first noticed how light weight it was.

They are made beautifully and perfectly for the use of cooking. I love to cook in Rachael Ray cookware. The food was delicious and tasty whenever i use these product for cooking.I always use to cook dal. Unfortunately, one day I forgot to turn off the stove and i see all mess in my kitchen. I see the dal was totally overcooked and some part of it was sticked to the cookware. That could have resulted in quite a mess with some other types of cookware, but it cleaned up quickly and still looked brand new.What I liked:* The design is very modern and attractive.* The glass lids have a sturdy rim that is designed so food will not be easily trapped* The orange handles are non-slip and easy to grip, and they keep very cool while cooking* The small size pots are very handy, and the 6 quart stock pot is a nice small-size stockpot that I'm finding a much better size for my use.* Cleanup was super easyWhat I didn't like:* The pots seem to be about half the thickness of most of my other pots and pans. While I don't think they would dent easily if dropped, they don't have a sturdy, well made feel to them.* When compared to my Calphalon, they also do not have the same quality hard anodized finish on the outside.* The nonstick coating doesn't feel as high quality as other brands. So far, so good though!* The pans do not have a thick bottom, and seem to heat unevenly.

Structurally this pan is 11"" square and ~2 to 2-1/2 deep. It arrived intact, no scrapes of anything like that. I purchased the pan w/orange colored handle. The handle is ~9"" long, so if you are planning storage space, the overall span, then is about 20"" (see pics) and diagonally it is 13-1/4"", so I have it stacked on a 14"" round pan. The grill nubs/ridges are about 1/16"" high, ~ 5-1/2 "" long.The handle feels like a soft silicone and there is a nice indentation for your thumb to grab on to the handle. The handle is nice in that it doesn\'t within reason heat up (like a metal handle) or if you keep an eye on location, does not burn. The handle does not fold. The ad / info says it can withstand oven temps to 350 degrees. It is made of anodized aluminum and should not rust. The attachment of the handle to the pan is well done and study- with the rivets being a good size. The grill pan weighs 2 lbs-5 oz for those conscious of weight, much less than a cast iron skillet. No seasoning / pre -seasoning needed. I use it on a gas stove, but the Q&A info indicates it works on electric, ceramic, glass, and electric cooktops; but not induction. In contrast to cast iron, the pan does not hold heat once the burner is turned off.The gill is divided up into 4 sections, great for burgers, steaks, grilled cheese sandwiches, and seared AHI tuna, of course for longer cuts of meat such as a flank steak, it does not provide the continuous (pretty) pattern of the outdoor BBQ. I use the grill on a Viking gas stove with a 4"" burner with a grate of about 8"" and the pan heats quickly and evenly. I think I read somewhere to not cook at higher than medium-high. The non-stick surface has worked well thus far and I use less oil than maybe other pans. For splash/splatter control I use a round lid. Rachel Ray does not make a square lid, but there is one avail from another vendor (see link below), I haven\'t purchased this.Cleaning is easy with a scouring/sponge pad / brush designed for teflon type surfaces, sometimes letting it soak awhile after dinner. If overcooked in particular, the brush will work well to clean between the folds of the grill. Other times I just throw it in the dishwasher. Clean-up is so easy, I have gotten away from using the gas grill on the Viking gas stove.Overall pleased with this grilling pan, functional, easy to use, cleans easily, a great size for the typical burner/cooking appliance.Link to square lid:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CP1CL2T/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 25, 2020', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars A solid, non-stick grill pan', 'author': 'Chella', 'rating': 4, 'content': ""This is a solid grill pan, especially for the relatively inexpensive price. I wanted to start to cook my own grilled chicken, burgers, etc. at home, and this was a nice jump. Keep in mind, I've never had a grill pan before, so this is my first experience with one!First, this pan is a decent size - it can easily hold four burgers at once, or multiple chicken breasts. If you allow the pan to pre-heat, you do get those nice grill marks on the food. It's still as non-stick as ever, but I took note of the directions before hand (medium heat and a soft sponge!) to ensure it lasts a long time.The biggest issue I have with this pan is the time it takes to cook food, especially things like chicken. It takes a LONG time to grill chicken breasts unless they are super thin. The first few times I used this pan, I had to put the chicken back to cook, even after 5 minutes per side. I have resulted to adding a bit of water to the pan at the end of the cooking process to create some steam to super-heat the pan, but I shouldn't have to do that. Also, this pan did not come with a cover, so I am using other lids to trap the heat in place.In addition, the pan is a pain in the butt to clean. It's definitely nonstick, but food tends to get trapped in the ridges of the grill sections. I am sure this is a common problem with grill pans... but I just thought I would mention it! I usually use a paper towel to clean this pan, and I have to really dig into those ridges in order to get the gunk out.Like I mentioned, this is a solid nonstick grill pan that does what it promises.

Since then I've used it everyday at least twice a day, sometimes more than that. Started with simple soap and warm water wash, wiped it and then started using it. I've used it initially on coils for first 8 months, always between medium-high heat and the same with gas stove. After I'm done using it, I always remove it from heat immediately on a colder side of the stove, thus avoiding unnecessary overheating. Another simple care is I never use water on it when it was hot. For cleaning it, simple tap water is best except when I used oil on it. For any oil cooking, normal dish soap and soft sponge was sufficient. I've cooked eggs, many sorts of flatbreads (used twice everyday for Indian flatbreads) and different types of crepes, pancakes, dosa and....many more! Never had any warping problem or any other problem. Great for both with and without oil cooking. I've never used it in oven so no idea about that. After putting it to rigorous use all these months, now my pan looks like this, little scratches and discoloration at some places.

I have used this pan to make them for years now and I wanted to point out a couple of issues that may not be readily noticeable. But first I will talk about the plusses to this item. First, the price is really good for what you get. The surface of the pan has been easy to clean and since mine gets daily use I would say overall it holds up pretty well to the many times I use it. But there are a couple of issues that should be noted.The first, if you will look at the pictures of this pan, you will see the handles are attached by screws. The Screw heads are inside the pan. These Screw heads are not Copper stick free screw heads, therefore if you make thick pancakes or thick omelets like I do, the egg will stick to these screw heads every time. Every Time. I have to spray these screws with Pam in order to use these without it sticking which kinda makes them ""almost non-stick"" instead of truely no-stick.Second, the hinges are weak. the hinges are made of the flimsiest of all flimsiest metals. The pan surface itself will outlast the hinges by a long shot. Since I use mine to make omelets, having the hinges is important in that it makes it really easy to flip the pan. What should last me many many years only last a few.All that being said, if they would fix these two issues, either construct these with the handles incorporated in the metal and affixed internally and make hinges that are truely made to last, I would easily pay double for one. It does a good job for what I need it to do and would be a tremendous product if they addressed these two issues.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 21, 2021', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Works as advertised.', 'author': 'Stephen Worley', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Have used this item quite a number of times.

In order to get it to flip without oil you have to try to loosen it up with a spatula before flipping and what's the point if you need to use a spatula on this. However if you put a little oil before you put the pancake batter in, it will flip properly, sometimes with a little jerk down motion will make it drop.

This thing was no exception, so why would I have bought it anyway? I had one and only one task for it in mind, and that so seldomly durability was not that important to me. My one use for it was to make one large pancake for myself for breakfast onto which I could put a fried egg or any other topping of my choice. So my first question, one that any manufacturer of such a product would have in big bold letters, was what is its diameter. Nowhere on their ad page could I find one word about that, only that it is “large” and that it is two-inches thick. I would never in my life expect to make a pancake two inches thick so I don’t know why I would want to know that.IT GOES DOWNHILLThe breathless worded ad copy continued in the royal tradition of the seen on TV tradition, including the extensive use of the word copper as if it has a health benefit. Okay there are some claims about wearing a pure copper bracelet that some say to have magical qualities but are you ready for the honest truth now? There isn’t evidence of an ounce of copper in this thing, it is only a copper colored non-stick coating, or at least supposedly non-stick. As if that farce wasn’t enough they actually go on to say, or make you think they say, that it is made from titanium encrusted with diamonds. That is so funny I can hardly type the words without laughing. No, it is aluminum with a copper colored coating. The cleverly worded fine print is that it has a “diamond sparkle look coating”. And the wording “titanium ceramic” seem to be some well disguised trademarked terminology. So much for believing what you see on TV.QUALITYIt doesn’t sound right to use the word quality in a sentence describing this thing, but to be fair it only cost twenty bucks, about what a cheap frying pan cost at the discount store. I always suggest to read the one star reviews first and this is a great example of that, they are spot on accurate and you know they aren’t planted by employees of the maker. They all point to the extremely bad hinge design that is uses two pop rivets that are almost guaranteed to break. Even being really careful with it it’s just not designed well. Yes but isn’t it true that I went ahead and bought it anyway? I admit to that, but I said earlier that I expected to use it maybe once or at the most twice a month, and the only thing that attracted me over an ordinary frying pan is I am really bad at turning pancakes over and the best ones are cooked equally on both sides. I didn’t want yet another electric appliance because most of them don’t heat 100% evenly anyway, this held the promise, weak as it was, that it could spread the heat more evenly on my electric stovetop and I told myself that if I wait until the pancake (or even an omelet) as half cooked it shouldn’t leak out if I flip it over really fast. That idea sort of works but if I can’t see the food cooking I would have to experiment many times to get it even half right. One detail I did not like was that the rivets used to attach the handles are prone to having food stick to the crevices, which would make it a chore to clean it.SIZE MATTERSMy opening thought was about the diameter. Not trusting gadgets like this I had high hopes that they weren’t trying to pull another fast one on me and that it wasn’t anywhere near as big as they make it look. My instincts were right, I had hopes this would make one pancake that’s big enough for an adult, that would be about nine inches, but no, the maximum working area inside the pan is only a meager five inches. Using their directions it would take me about five minutes to make one five inch pancake. If I wanted four of them, which I guess is a full stack, it would take me at least 20 minutes to make breakfast for myself. On the same subject, since the pan tapers down to around five inches it is smaller than the smallest burner on my stove, which means the rising heat would eventually scorch the entire pan.THE FINE PRINTHere’s the shocker. Cleverly hidden inside the box, looking like one of those warranty sheets that no one ever reads, on the reverse side is a contract. No seriously, it is a lengthy legal contract that tells you that you already agreed to a long list of terms and conditions when you pressed the “buy” button, including giving up your legal rights and having to pay your own costs for any legal action. I have never seen anything so audacious on any product in my life and that instantly dropped their rating to zero and I put the thing back in the box and returned it. As public notice I do not accept or agree to any conditions they say I agreed to by buying this thing and by accepting my return Gotham Steel/Emson has agreed to my terms which will be available to them upon written request. On every count this is thing is rejected.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 15, 2023', 'is_verified': True}]"

Works well. Use with good habits', 'author': 'Luis Garcia', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I\'ll review this in order but overall if you want to know now this is the best ""cheap"" product I have ever purchased on amazon.Main points: Due to other reviews claiming the nonstick surface scratched off their pans I\'d recommend you Never use any metal items against this pans surface or else you will scratch off the nonstick surface (this goes with any pan but I guess it has to be restated here). Scratching off teflon is highly carcinogenic as well as for metal pans their coatings are also not good to ingest so get into the habit of not scratching your pans. Use wood or anything non metallic that can handle the high heat for cooking.Another thing to consider potentially based on other reviewers: Dont immediately cool down your pan (or any pans ever) if they have been heated or just taken off the heat. If you do then the surface of the teflon may crack as seen in other reviews.Another thing to NOT do is based on the assumption that the handle may not be perfectly secured (it\'s not a fusion or welded mold) the handle coating itself seems to be maybe glued or coated on the inner metal handle which may come off if you place the entire pan in your oven. This pan doesn\'t look like it\'s capable of being placed into an oven to roast your food. I wouldn\'t suggest it nor try it myself due to this minor potential quality ""flaw"". You shouldn\'t need to place the pan into the oven, it wasn\'t made for that.Heat Distribution - 5/5The pan heats up well if you have any issues it may be your electric stovetop taking a while to heat up itself. The pan cooks the sides of my food very well. Anything touching the pan or oil within the pan will be hot. If you are having issues it may be due to lack of contact with a hot part which may cause uneven heating of your food.Easy to Clean - 5/5The product has a very good nonstick surface and it makes the food that was cooked on the pan and even if the food was left on over night if you persoak the pan with soap then it will come right off due to that non stick surface. Use a rough sponge but dont use a steel wool since that will probably scratch the nonstick surface.Value for money - 5/5This product works and is very useful for the price. I\'d gladly order another pair when and if these pans do eventually fail but for now the coating is very nice and hasn\'t failed me yet in any capacity.This pan seems like a great value. It works incredibly well and if you treat it right and dont scratch the surface then it will last you as long as you can maintain good pan handling habits!Conclusion:If you want a durable pan that can handle your every mistake, this may not be for you. If you are a diligent owner that wants to preserve their pans and tools, then this will be perfect for you. I havent had any issues with my pans and I dont expect to. But if I do I\'ll detail in a revision/ edit of what occured and by what rough time frame from purchase that it occured.1 month of constant use from this post.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States June 5, 2020', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Heat transfers evenly over the surface, and light-weught handles prevent pans from tipping.', 'author': 'Ralph E.

I’d been wanted to ditch my non-stick cookware for several years for health reasons but couldn’t find the right fit. I’m spoiled by growing up cooking with only non-stick cookware. And I’m NOT a good cook so I tend to overheat pans & burn food. AND I sooo dislike cleaning up after cooking that I’d prefer to do it later (like the next day). I’m possibly the worst case scenario for testing any cookware line. I’d honestly much rather enjoy being served nice meals in restaurants. But, I’m immunocompromised so COVID changed all that. So, I’ve needed to up my game & learn to cook decently.I first tested several brands of stainless steel cookware. It was a total nightmare for me to clean. I then tried out ceramic cookware but found it to be too heavy for my arthritic joints. After reading about and researching Hestan’s Nanobond’s titanium coating, I thought it sounded promising & ordered this pan. Besides, the design of all of Hestan’s cookware is simply gorgeous.This Hestan Nanobond pan turned out to be AMAZING. My 1st test was fried eggs that turned out perfect with no sticking and easy cleanup afterwards. I’d read to heat the pan first, then add the oil/butter next & let it heat, and to then add the eggs. That definitely works to make the surface as close to being non-stick without actually having a non-stick coating. I’ve used it repeatedly for sticky foods like fried eggs, scrambled eggs, grilled cheese sandwiches, etc. with thrilling results. Best of all, it’s easy to clean afterwards.The Hestan Nanobond cookware is fantastic & suits my needs perfectly. I’ve now bought many more of the pots and pans in all shapes & sizes. I’m thrilled with the good looks & performance of the Nanobond line, the ease of cleaning up afterwards, and the titanium coating’s overall forgivingness for bad cooks. I accidentally added ground sausage needing to be browned for a casserole directly to their still-warming 3.5 quart sauté pan. The sausage stuck immediately to the bottom & I knew I’d really screwed up. While stirring the rest of the meat with only a silicon spatula, however, the stuck remnants surprisingly released completely from the bottom! I then decided to go ahead & try baking the entire casserole in the covered Nanobond pan in the oven instead of dirtying up a casserole dish. The casserole turned out fantastic with perfectly browned sides & bottom. The servings easily released from the pan without falling apart. And the very baked-on food remnants STILL cleaned up easily. The beautiful design of Hestan’s cookware really makes it equally appealing for stove/oven to table presentation.

I am hesitant to buy the larger skillets if they are going to be super thin like the 8 inch is.BOTTOM LINE:I think I’m going to love this pan for scrambled eggs, and I don’t know what else.. I plan to try a reverse sear with salmon or a hamburger.. I usually slow cook vegetables in an enameled cast iron sauce pan, so I don’t have to worry about salt and other seasonings leaching the SS.. But I suppose I will try some vegetables in the nano bond titanium (as a little browning is supposed to add a layer of flavor.. but I suspect browning anything is less healthy).STICK, OR NOT TO STICK?Mystery solved.. I was perplexed by so many reviews complaining about things sticking to the titanium nanobond, because my scrambled eggs were sliding around, almost like a nonstick pan. I just watched a video comparison of three different stainless steel pans.. The Heston nanobond, and demeyere (both of which I have cooked scrambled eggs on).. In the video they got the pans hot until the water drops danced around, which I think of it as a trick that allows you to cook scrambled eggs in cast-iron.. Plus they used what looked like some kind of vegetable oil.. And the egg was stuck in the pan bad.. I use butter at a low temperature (which I believe is appropriate for eggs), and the eggs don’t stick at all..LEACHING INTO FOODI’ve always heard that titanium is extremely non-reactive, but I have been UNABLE to find any information (other than manufacturers claims) whether titanium cookware will leach anything into food while cooking (ie: acidic foods, like tomato paste, or how it’s well known that salt will pit stainless steel).. Titanium is supposed to be completely safe for humans, so we can only hope if anything leeches it would be pure titanium (manufacturers tend to be untrustworthy, I can only hope in Italy they have tighter regulations for such things than in America).. If you search the Internet you can find where testing was done with SS pans.. Some manufacturers claim you can cook tomato red sauce in them (even though tomatoes do leech from SS)..SUPER THIN?When I say super thin, perhaps I’m spoiled by using expensive aluminum clad cookware from other brands that have a hefty amount of aluminum.. Because of the high price of Heston nano bond cookware, they should pop for thick enough aluminum layer to where we should have to wonder if it’s enough.. And to be clear I don’t know how thick the aluminum layer needs to be to do. It’s job..The thin-ness of the pan makes me wonder if it would be prone to warping (with my other stainless steel pans, I clean them while they are hot, but I am fearful to put water into these thin nano bond skillets).. NOTE: I don’t put a lot of cold water into a hot pan, rather a little bit that steam cleans most of the pan (none of my pans have ever warped).HEAT MOMENTUM:The other problem with extra thin aluminum cladding is heat momentum.. Heat momentum is one of the reasons cast-iron pans work so well for certain things (such as putting a frozen hamburger patty, and getting heat momentum to create the seer.. instead of the frozen patty immediately cooling off the pan which destroys the seer). In my particular case, using the control freak induction burner that has a built-in temperature probe, it will probably compensate by instantly turning the power up (which I hear it doing when I take a little off, to try to maintain temperature).. I doubt the thin aluminum will work in this instance, if you’re trying to cook a frozen steak or anything substantial without cool in the pan off..NON-STICK:I have not used nonstick pans for decades, but I have been cooking scrambled eggs in aluminum clad stainless steel pans for years.. And for the past year. I’ve been using Demeyere SS skillets, which have a treated SS surface that concentrates the chromium and nickel and removes the iron (it makes the stainless steel, more stainless steel, and it does stick less than regular SS, but not by much)..[Again contrary to what many reviews are saying], when I cooked scrambled eggs in the Heston nanobond it felt like nonstick to me. There was an obvious non-stick quality even compared to my demeyere). Like my demeyere pans, I expect I will have to occasionally use the special cleaner, or barkeepers friend, to get rid of the haze/seasoning that develops (this is expected)..Likewise cleanup was very easy (like I would imagine non-stick would be).TOO—LIGHT—WEIGHT?I know other reviews think it’s thick/heavy, but it is by far the lightest pan I have ever held in my hands (and I’ve used a few different brands of aluminum clad stainless steel pans).. I realize titanium is light weight, but the nano bond is a very thin layer of titanium (presumably over stainless steel)..The pan is so light weight that it’s causing the problem with my control, freak induction burner.. The 8” or will sit flat by itself, but because it’s so light weight, and the handle is relatively heavy, it will not sit flat on the induction burner for preheating, because there is a temperature probe in the center (that has a lightweight spring)..And (when cooking anything sensitive to uneven heat) you very much need to preheat pans on an induction burner, because the nature of induction heats the pan itself so there is always a hot ring in the center of the pan that matches the induction ring (preheating for a while lets the heat spread out)..BOTTOM LINE: I was able to preheat the pan to cook my scrambled eggs, but one end of the pan was about 1/8” off the induction burner (and induction burners are sensitive to this.I WOULD HATE: to try to preheat the 8” pan for a seer on this induction burner (the 1/8” in the air might end up a huge problem at high power settings)..COOKING TECHNIQUES:There is technique to consider in whether eggs or anything sticks or not..For scrambled eggs I use low heat (228F.. since my induction burner controls the temperature).. and I use plenty of butter (I am convinced, low carb is healthy, and butter and egg yolks are healthy fats).. my eggs were sliding around the pan like the nonstick advertisements..CLEANUP:My experience with cleanup was like you would imagine nonstick. But I’ve seen many reviews complain about food sticking to the pan (I can only assume they were using high heat, and maybe little or no oil).. I can’t say for sure, but I know with my other stainless steel pans anytime something sticks, I just put a squeeze of dish soap and a little water and come back in an hour (or the next morning).. If I’m in a hurry, I’ll turn on the burner for a few seconds so warm soap will work faster.. Then whatever was stuck on usually falls off.. Sometimes I use vinegar (I don’t know whether dish soap vinegar would be more effective)..', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 20, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Very high quality in ALMOST every area.', 'author': 'Teddy', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'Pros: the finish looks beautiful as it’s slightly a smoky grey color which is very smooth and though not nonstick is less sticky than other stainless steel pans I’ve used.

Mostly small nitpicks but for an expensive pan small can be big depending on your taste. Pricey. On my induction top at least the pan bottom warps very slightly so as thin coat of oil tends to pool towards the outer edges of the pan, this pretty common in a lot of pans but i do wish at this price it could be avoided.

And I’m happy about that. I needed something larger, but with low sides, as this one has.The blue is pretty—it’s blue only on the handles—and is a sort of blue-green.The bottom came with a scratch—I can barely see it but it’s there and I don’t know if that’s a manufacturer mark, shipping, or what, but otherwise it is perfect. I almost took off a star for that but I’m so pleased with the skillet and the price I bought it for, I left my stars at 5.No sticking so far. I washed mine by hand and though on the bottom is indicates it is dishwasher safe, I’m likely to hand wash it most of the time—due partly to the size of it; however, it does fit fine in the dishwasher.There are two sturdy handles: both handles are stainless but with the colored covering that feels like rubber—cool touch covering. There is the long handle side, firmly attached and sturdy; there is the shorter handle on the other side that is also attached firmly and sturdily—the shorter side helps if you have to pick up the skillet with something heavier in it since it is a large skillet so you aren’t trying to hold it with one hand.The skillet sat evenly on my stovetop without any rocking or movement at all.The price is very reasonable. I had a anodized nonstick skillet from Anolon that cost over $60 and it began peeling very badly after about a year or less; this Rachael Ray is half the cost of that—time will tell how long it will last but at least the price is more reasonable and it’s a bigger and nicer looking skillet than the Anolon.The only other items I have from Rachael Ray’s kitchen collection is a set of blue bowls and I’ve really loved those bowls! They’re quality, they look good on my countertop, and they’re made very well; the price was reasonable on those as well. So I’m likely to take a look at some of her other kitchen items.I’m happy with my purchase and hoping there’s no peeling.

It is a little bigger than the biggest burner on my stovetop, but it still cooks evenly. I\'ve used it almost daily for the last 2 months and I\'ve made a variety of things in it: stir fry, beef stroganoff, scrambled eggs, sautéed meats, grilled cheese, and French toast to name a few.

I don\'t use metal cooking utensils with this, so I\'ve had no issues with nonstick coating coming off as others have mentioned. I also wouldn\'t store it underneath other pans, which may have contributed to other reviewers having the coating come off.

I also fry skinless chicken breasts, pork, & hamburgers. But one needs to be careful not to overheat the skillet. Also, although they say the skillet will handle metal utensils, I just can't bring myself to use them.I didn't plan on such a long response but one thing leads to another. I'm new at cooking and didn't realize that there's more to it than I realized. Especially when it comes to pan frying chicken at the proper temperature. I've got to say that I admire the knowledge that you cooks have & that I've just taken for granted. So, maybe you'll have a good chuckle at my lack of cooking knowledge.Turns out that all non-stick skillets have a temperature limit before the surface gets damaged. Apparently, I was supposed to read the instructions before bringing fire into the mix. So, please follow the instructions so that you don't exceed the temperature range like I did. I overheated (>525 deg F) one of my 2 skillets without realizing it, multiple times, when frying hamburgers, skinless chicken breasts , and pork. I've since dedicated the overheated damaged pan to only frying the meats as they have their own fat/oil to reduce sticking. I can't use it for eggs anymore because they stick and I don't want to use any oil. I use my 2nd Circulon Symmetry skillet for eggs. One thing nice about frying eggs is that it's easy to tell when the heat is too high, the eggs quickly burn. Meat, however, takes a while to burn & even longer for me to notice that the skillet is way too hot. What can I say, I'm an amateur.The temperature limit is in the skillet's instructions. For the gas range, I now use the same 400 deg limit that they state for oven use. Ever since the tainted chicken scare, I've been using an old infrared thermometer to check the temperature of the top of the meat (& now also the bottom of the skillet). Just point the red dot and read the temperature on the display. It's an easy way to make sure that the top of the chicken reaches 160 deg F without overheating the pan.I've just recently noticed/realized that chicken breasts take longer to cook when I don't use oil. Without oil, I have to flip the chicken more often to ensure that it gets cooked throughout at over 160 deg F. The temperature of the top of the chicken barely gets to 160 Deg F when the frying pan is at 400 deg F (I think they invented infrared thermometers just for me).This made me realize another reason for using some oil, heat transfer. The oil transfers the heat of the skillet into the meat a lot quicker/better. This means that: 1) By using oil, the meat cooks hotter & quicker, at a lower skillet temperature and/or does NOT need flipped as often. 2) By NOT using oil, the meat reaches a lower temperature & takes longer to cook, needs a hotter skillet and/or needs flipping more often.That's all I have to say about that.

I saw many negative reviews where people didn\'t use any oil or butter in the pan first and were unhappy with the results. While I found the same thing, simply adding a little butter or Smart Balance to cover the bottom of the pan results in an excellent non-stick experience. Just this morning I cooked three sunny side up eggs and they slid out of the pan without a spatula. So, while it may me disappointing that the pan doesn\'t work well with no oil or butter, the fact that it does work extremely well with it still puts these pans light years ahead of the many other non-stick pans I\'ve used and thrown out. DON\'T LET THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS DISSUADE YOU -- IF YOU SEASON THE PAN PROPERLY (as per the instructions) AND USE A LITTLE BUTTER OR OIL THESE PANS ARE OUTSTANDING.****************As most people I started out with teflon pans years ago. They eventually lost their nonstick properties, so I searched for healthier options without toxic chemicals to replace them. First I tried pans from Ozeri, which I felt better about for health reasons, but as with most ""nonstick"" pans they quickly lost their nonstick properties. Next I tried pans from Denmark after a good experience with them at a summer rental a few years back, but that yielded basically the same result. At this point I\'d pretty much lost hope that any of these healthier nonstick pans would continue to work after a few months. Finally I decided to use my Consumer Reports subscription to see if they had anything worth trying. Duh! I was surprised to see that Red Copper pans were highly rated so I gave them a shot. FINALLY, a nontoxic, nonstick pan that ACTUALLY WORKS!!!I\'ve had the 10- and 12-inch sizes for several months under fairly heavy use so this seemed like a long enough time to write a worthwhile review -- but I WILL UPDATE if these pans end up disappointing down the road. First, I strictly followed the directions and seasoned both pans before using them (none of the other pans required or specified this step and I wonder if it would\'ve helped at all). I don\'t know how important this step is, but given my positive results I\'ll just say MAKE SURE YOU DO THIS FIRST BEFORE USING THE PAN. Also, the directions state that if the pans do start to lose their nonstick properties, just repeat this seasoning procedure. This actually gives me some hope that these pans might actually continue to work down the line. At first I was disappointed because the second batch of scrambled eggs I made -- right after the first batch without adding any more oil or butter -- started to stick pretty badly. Out of habit, for the first batch I used a little Smart Balance (the regular stuff, not the light version that doesn\'t melt well -- by the way I NEVER use real butter anymore as this tastes just like butter but MUCH healthier -- TRY IT!) so the next batch I added a little Smart Balance before cooking the eggs and, YIPPEE!!!!!! Although I\'m just slightly disappointed that I can\'t just cook without adding anything to the pan first, adding a little Smart Balance is a small price to pay to have a truly nonstick experience. Seriously, eggs just slide right out of the pan. Even sunny side up eggs, with maybe just a little bit of coaxing with a spatula, literally slide right onto the plate. AMAZING!!! I don\'t add anything when cooking stuff like hamburger meat for tacos and the pan works great without any significant sticking. BTW, I kept the plastic covers the pans came in so I can stack them without risking damaging the nonstick surface, and I do NOT use any metal utensils while cooking with these pans in the hope of prolonging their nonstick life.So, what I like about the pans (other than the excellent nontoxic and nonstick properties) are that they seem well built, and the bottoms of the pans are actually pretty flat. Ozeri pans were not flat and oil or butter would collect around the outside of the pan and away from the center. Argh! Despite the handle being metal it somehow remains relatively cool as long as you grab it more toward the end, and it\'s great that the pans can be used in the oven if necessary.All this goodness notwithstanding, there are some things I wish were a little better. Despite being well built the pans are still relatively light weight, and with not much in them the weight of the handle is enough to tip the pan toward it if you put it down quickly or carelessly. And the pans seem relatively shallow, which means they don\'t hold as much and also make flipping food a little more difficult than a deeper pan. The most annoying thing though is that my standard lids will not lock into place on these pans. This seems like a cheap trick to incentivize customers to buy Red Copper lids. I just continue to use my lids as they do sit on top of the pan, but they will slide off if they\'re pushed or the pan is tilted. Despite these not insignificant negatives, I\'m GLADLY living with them because they are so far outweighed by having a healthy nonstick pan that actually works.So in the end, while they\'re not perfect (name me something that is), overall I\'m thrilled with these pans and most likely will be buying more.

It is definitely worth the price for having it last so many years. Also, make sure you don't use the spray cans on this pan as I found it left a sticky residue which was what ultimately led me to needed a new one. Now I only use butter, a splash of oil, or just some water when cooking and it always turns out perfect without any stick.I never use metal utensils on this pan, I have plenty of plastic or silicone spatulas so there is no point in taking the risk of ruining the pan.

There are two problems, though:- The handle, which is stamped metal, is pretty uncomfortable, especially when you're flipping something. I understand that not using plastic allows it to be oven-safe, but a tubular metal handle would be a big improvement.- Although it seems very slick, fried eggs just will NOT slide in the pan. You can easily lift them off with a spatula, but try and just flip them and no dice: they stay where they are. So, I now have to dirty a spatula every time I fry some eggs. (Again, the pan itself seems extremely slick; it's just something about the surface which resists sliding by eggs.)I miss flipping my eggs. I'll see how long the pan lasts, but unless it's for a good three or four years I'll probably switch back to Teflon.Edit: after a week of breakfasts, eggs now slide just fine, and I'm back to flipping.

I've figured out that it took 20 minutes for the first side to get done and then flipping it over for 10 minutes for the second side.However, I noticed with this new frying pan, it started burning after 10 minutes and flipped it over and the second side started to burn after 5 minutes so it only took 1/2 of the time to make my sausage pattie.This was a pain because I always had time to wash my potato and shred it for the hashbrowns, get out all the ingredients for the French toast and scrambled eggs before I even needed to flip the sausage pattie but today, I really had to bust my butt to get everything else ready.Grabbing the lid handle was easy with the silicone coating since my old frying pan had a glass lid with a glass handle and the handle would get really hot.Hashbrowns also cooked in 1/2 of the time and they stuck a little bit because I forgot how fast the sausage pattie cooked so the hashbrowns also cooked much faster.The French toast also stuck but only a little but I kept close to them flipping them after 2 minutes.The scrambled eggs also only took about 3 minutes instead of about 5 minutes.Haven't cleaned the large frying pan since it's still hot and wanted to get this out right away.Now, what I don't like about these is the steamer pan because it only fits about 1/3 of the way into the medium sauce pan instead of all the way down. I was really hoping to use it like a strainer for making spaghetti so I didn't need to get the large colander out to drain the spaghetti.I was hoping to boil the spaghetti right in the steamer pan and pull it right out draining all the water at the same time.Other than the steamer pan, I really like the feel, weight, and sturdiness of these pans so far but I've only used the large frying pan and lid.

Kinda like how you gotta pre-heat your (good) stainless steel pans.The fact that they have other nice features (stacking handles, high-temp oven-safe, induction-ready) are just icing on the cake since I would’ve bought more of these simply for their durability if nothing else.Oh, let me kinda sorta point out one downside: that extra handle, while useful for stacking, just means more rivets and gets in the way of quick flips sometimes (think pancakes).

My earlier Cephalon pot had rubber handles that were safe to touch. This pot gets hot on the handles because they are metal. Not a big deal, the benefit is that you can place the whole pot in the oven. For future design recommendations, though, I’d prefer handles that I can grab without having to use a hot pad.

I have not seen any riveted pans that are NSF certified, due to bacteria/food being difficult to clean, especially with dishwasher-only process. There's no good reason not to weld the handles, or attaching hardware, other than maybe being cheaper? It's nice to use a spatula and cleanly swipe the inside of the pan to get what you're cooking off the sides....rivets prevent that. The removable handle(s) are a nice touch. I have never had any issues with the nuts or attachment process. Maybe some people did but could be a defect in the threads, or overtightening. Put a drop of oil on the threads before tightening, and lift the handle up and down while final-tightening, which allows a completely solid connection, which I have never had loosen. BTW, the thread is a 5mmx.8mm common metric thread, so if you lose a nut (they give you extras) you can buy them on amazon. Some pans have the handle permanently welded to the pan but I like the removable feature, allowing storage in tight areas, or I sometimes keep it off and use the pan like a pie pan to bake with, and the handle being off, makes it less cumbersome in the oven. If you make skillet-browned cornbread, this works almost as well as a cast iron skillet. There are no lids with this but the price is great, and you can buy lids, or if you're like me, you already have lids that fit these saute pans. The lip of these pans are flared out, making pouring liquid/stew/etc out clean with no drips down the side of the pan. I measured temperatures across the bottom of the pan while heating on an induction cooktop. The temperature was very uniform across the interior, and the magnetic coupling to the induction coils was very efficient, indicating a good magnetic stainless steel used in the mfg process. To season the pan, I use either coconut oil, or avacado oil (not spray oil, as the lecithin used for release agent will break down under high heat). So heat the pan to around 400F (after first cleaning it), then wipe the oil to coat the pan's inside with a paper towel and oven mitten(s). This will greatly reduce sticking. So to recap, great pan, flat bottom, great handle and attachment hardware, easy to clean and use. Price is also very good for high quality pans.

I am no chef and I purchased this for home use. I do however have a professional background as a food and beverage manager, and do know my way around a kitchen :) To be honest, whether this works for you will primarily depend on two things 1) Your expectations, and 2) The type of stove that you have or primarily use (Gas, Exposed Heating Element/Electric Coil, Induction, Glass Top with Enclosed Heating Element). ""Even Heat Distribution"" will depend not only on the pan, but also the type of stove and the size of the burner. So when reading reviews, look at the reviews using the same stove type that you will be cooking with :) I like and prefer induction, but at the moment I have a glass top with enclosed elements. I find that the pan heats up alright, but will be a bit slower than with gas or induction. For home use, I find this pan to work just fine :) The materials, finish, handle, comfort and heft (solidity) are all better than I had expected in this price range. I think this is a terrific value at this price point. Please note that as this is stainless steel, it will clean differently than a ""non stick"" type of pan :) Also, it feels very solid, and has the weight to back it up, so it is significantly heavier than a ""non stick"" pan. So if you might not have the hand, wrist or arm strength for heavy items, this may not be the right choice for you (this would not be a good choice for my 75+ yr old mother.) Also, this will not fit your needs if you want a ""branded"" pan with snob appeal or status benefits. (Those pans can cost 300% and 400% more). Lastly, it\'s impossible to speak of durability with new purchases. So, what\'s the bottom line here? I really think that most people with appropriate expectations will really like this pan! It will do its job well, and will look good and feel good in your hand while doing it! And it feels like it will last for years to come. Can you spend more on a pan? Yes. If you are a regular person, do you need to? No. I can afford to buy a more expensive pan if I wish, but there is no need to. I am happy with this purchase at a great price, and I think you will be as well.

They are made beautifully and perfectly for the use of cooking. I love to cook in Rachael Ray cookware. The food was delicious and tasty whenever i use these product for cooking.I always use to cook dal. Unfortunately, one day I forgot to turn off the stove and i see all mess in my kitchen. I see the dal was totally overcooked and some part of it was sticked to the cookware.

While I don't think they would dent easily if dropped, they don't have a sturdy, well made feel to them.* When compared to my Calphalon, they also do not have the same quality hard anodized finish on the outside.* The nonstick coating doesn't feel as high quality as other brands.

Structurally this pan is 11"" square and ~2 to 2-1/2 deep. It arrived intact, no scrapes of anything like that. I purchased the pan w/orange colored handle. The handle is ~9"" long, so if you are planning storage space, the overall span, then is about 20"" (see pics) and diagonally it is 13-1/4"", so I have it stacked on a 14"" round pan. The grill nubs/ridges are about 1/16"" high, ~ 5-1/2 "" long.The handle feels like a soft silicone and there is a nice indentation for your thumb to grab on to the handle. The handle is nice in that it doesn\'t within reason heat up (like a metal handle) or if you keep an eye on location, does not burn. The handle does not fold. The ad / info says it can withstand oven temps to 350 degrees. It is made of anodized aluminum and should not rust. The attachment of the handle to the pan is well done and study- with the rivets being a good size. The grill pan weighs 2 lbs-5 oz for those conscious of weight, much less than a cast iron skillet. No seasoning / pre -seasoning needed. I use it on a gas stove, but the Q&A info indicates it works on electric, ceramic, glass, and electric cooktops; but not induction. In contrast to cast iron, the pan does not hold heat once the burner is turned off.The gill is divided up into 4 sections, great for burgers, steaks, grilled cheese sandwiches, and seared AHI tuna, of course for longer cuts of meat such as a flank steak, it does not provide the continuous (pretty) pattern of the outdoor BBQ. I use the grill on a Viking gas stove with a 4"" burner with a grate of about 8"" and the pan heats quickly and evenly. I think I read somewhere to not cook at higher than medium-high. The non-stick surface has worked well thus far and I use less oil than maybe other pans. For splash/splatter control I use a round lid. Rachel Ray does not make a square lid, but there is one avail from another vendor (see link below), I haven\'t purchased this.Cleaning is easy with a scouring/sponge pad / brush designed for teflon type surfaces, sometimes letting it soak awhile after dinner. If overcooked in particular, the brush will work well to clean between the folds of the grill. Other times I just throw it in the dishwasher. Clean-up is so easy, I have gotten away from using the gas grill on the Viking gas stove.Overall pleased with this grilling pan, functional, easy to use, cleans easily, a great size for the typical burner/cooking appliance.Link to square lid:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CP1CL2T/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 25, 2020', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars A solid, non-stick grill pan', 'author': 'Chella', 'rating': 4, 'content': ""This is a solid grill pan, especially for the relatively inexpensive price. I wanted to start to cook my own grilled chicken, burgers, etc. at home, and this was a nice jump. Keep in mind, I've never had a grill pan before, so this is my first experience with one!First, this pan is a decent size - it can easily hold four burgers at once, or multiple chicken breasts. If you allow the pan to pre-heat, you do get those nice grill marks on the food. It's still as non-stick as ever, but I took note of the directions before hand (medium heat and a soft sponge!) to ensure it lasts a long time.The biggest issue I have with this pan is the time it takes to cook food, especially things like chicken. It takes a LONG time to grill chicken breasts unless they are super thin. The first few times I used this pan, I had to put the chicken back to cook, even after 5 minutes per side. I have resulted to adding a bit of water to the pan at the end of the cooking process to create some steam to super-heat the pan, but I shouldn't have to do that. Also, this pan did not come with a cover, so I am using other lids to trap the heat in place.In addition, the pan is a pain in the butt to clean. It's definitely nonstick, but food tends to get trapped in the ridges of the grill sections. I am sure this is a common problem with grill pans... but I just thought I would mention it! I usually use a paper towel to clean this pan, and I have to really dig into those ridges in order to get the gunk out.Like I mentioned, this is a solid nonstick grill pan that does what it promises.

After using it over a dozen times now, I can't believe I spent so many years settling for cheap non-stick pans. The Original Green Pan cooks food evenly without sticking, and requires only low to moderate heat. It is so easy to clean! Just let the pan cool down, add a bit of soapy water, and use a kitchen sponge to wipe out food bits and residues. I dry it immediately with a soft cotton towel and return it to its designated cupboard space.Speaking of this pan's non-stick surface, I love that it does not emit harmful chemicals into the air or the food, as I'm quite particular about reducing industrial products and by-products whenever possible.I also really like the style of this particular pan, the Paris Pro model. It has an attractive handle that stays cool even after the pan is over heat for several minutes.The only thing I don't like is that the manufacturer recommends never using cooking sprays because the aspirant can damage the anodized surface. It's an issue for me because I prefer to NOT use pressed oils in my food due to the added unnecessary fat calories (I don't even keep such oils in my kitchen!). But I can use water, wine, broth, or nothing in the case of some foods. Aside from that minor challenge, this pan is quickly becoming my new favorite for sautéing and braising, and re-heating small portions of leftovers.I separately bought the matching glass-and-metal cover, which helps with cooking foods like mushrooms, onions, fennel, and cauliflower, which I like to caramelize before softening.The price for this pan (and the cover) may seem high to some folks, but I feel it is worth the cost to have a pan that will likely last a lifetime when cared for properly!

I made this mistake with my first GreenPan. You absolutely cannot use these pans with metal utensils. You cannot wash these pans with anything abrasive, including gentle abrasive on the back of a sponge. You cannot let a meal burn on this pan. You cannot leave grease in this pan for a few hours to clean it up later. These actions WILL RUIN your pan and it will become sticky when dry no matter how many times you wash it.

Normally, a cheap nonstick frying pan will last me 3-4 years given that I take perfect care: silicon utensils, and always hand-washed. Good riddance! See my review of that pan for details, but the rivets and rim were not just NON-nonstick, they were egg magnets. So hello, Greenpan! I paid $34, did a lot of research, including ATK and other respected sources. Its rivets and rim are nonstick, and, after scrambling eggs, it washes up perfectly with the SOFT side of a sponge. Given that I use my 8” frying pan frequently, I feel okay about the price because it’s free from the pxxx’s. My only “complaint” is that I wish they would eliminate the double-speak in packaging: You’re looking at the packaging around the pan. The white “Quick Tips” sticker in the middle was on the bottom of the pan, and I put it on top of the packaging. Note at middle right in rather large letters, it says “METAL UTENSIL SAFE” with an image of a spatula that one guesses is…metal? The Amazon product description has similar language. But under “Quick Tips” and “Utensils” it says “Silicon utensils are best and will extend the life of your coating.” While researching, I noted numerous examples of the same doublespeak in product descriptions from other manufacturers. But, if I paid $34 based on the expectation that I could use metal spatulas and ??? Whisks??? with aplomb, I would expect to get at least 4-5 years of use. Perhaps’s that’s the case: I don’t know; however, Greenpan’s own packaging contradiction makes me doubtful—and I don’t intend to find out, because I will treat it with loving care! Update after several months of use: This is a dream pan.

Being from Brazil or from China is the same thing, it was still a foreign manufacturer.Moving on, this pan is very good. Heats evenly and holds its heat for a while, but not as long as cast iron which is what you\'re looking for in something like this. To get very hot for searing, it only needs to be on medium heat for maybe 2-3 minutes. It transfers heat well so you do not need to put it on high. I have used it for a couple months now and the bottom is still perfectly flat. The only downside to this pan is that is has less flat surface on the bottom compared to my other 12"" pan because of the gently sloping sides. I still find myself using this more often though because it just cooks better despite not being non-stick.A quick note on it not being non-stick. This is really not a huge deal. Heat up the oil in the pan first and the food still doesn\'t stick much. It does a must better job at putting a nice crust on food than my non-stick skillet. Also for cleaning, just put some hot water (from the tap is fine) in the pan while it is still hot after use and let it sit while you eat.

M. Czechowicz', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I was on the prowl for a new skillet, as my last one, of the granite variety, had lost its nonstick ability. I've been through a ton of skillets for the same reason: Tfal, Cuisinart, Calphalon, GraniteStone, etc. I was intrigued by this one because it had tall sides, a lid, and was blue. When it came in, I discovered it actually has mermaid type scales on the side and color shifting glitter on the outside as well. It's really quite pretty. But I didn't buy it for beauty. I bought it because I was tired of scraping burnt cottage cheese out of my granite or cast iron skillet every morning. No matter what temperature I used or what time I added it, the cheese in my eggs always stuck. Not any more! Not only did it not stick, but all I had to do to clean it after I was done was use a dry paper towel and it was spot free (see my first photo). The surface is much less textured than granite or cast iron. I'm exceedingly impressed...and happy I won't be soaking skillets anytime soon!There are many other benefits of this skillet in addition to it being completely nonstick. The deep sides are truly deep, as you can see in the photo of the glittery scales, it holds a lot of food. I have a bad habit of flipping food out of more low profile skillets, but have not had that problem with this one, which means less time scrubbing my stove top clean. The lid is also a nice little piece of engineering as the rubber around the ring helps prevent moisture from bubbling out or over the sides hither, thither, and yon. Instead it escapes from two specific places marked on either side of the lid (photo 3). Unlike the metal rimmed lids that have scalded me in the past, I can turn the lid so that steam escapes where I want it and I can attend to other pots and pans on the stove without worrying about being burned. It's sturdy, but not as heavy as cast iron. It heats evenly and the handle never gets hot. It comes with a Phillips screwdriver so you can attach the handle. All in all, I'm very pleased with my purchase and have found no cons. I can't wait to see what else I can cook in it."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 6, 2021', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great Pan', 'author': 'joeglo', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'We really like this pan.

The non-stick is very slick, and gives a good sear. The lid fits well, and the silicone edging seems sturdy - I'll stand it on edge while I'm cooking, and it hasn't warped yet. Only minor hot-spotting on a gas range - gets up to temp quick, and the heat is impressively consistent for how light weight it is. Not cast iron level, obviously, but it's on par with our Calphalon pan of similar diameter that weighs twice as much.So far I've used this to brown ground meat, saute aromatics, make gravy, cook burgers, simmer broth, make french toast and omelettes (no stuck egg residue, perfect bake/steaming in the pan with lid on the stovetop), and heat syrup (swirls and pours out cleanly, no stirring implement necessary).

I really don’t fry an awful lot, but when I do, I can’t wait to get out my beautiful blue frying pan! When I realized that the nonstick coating was failing on 2 of my old skillets, I started shopping around in stores and here on Amazon. Many of the reviews for these Ailwyn frying pans were over-the-top, so I ordered both the 9” and 11” pans. Oh my goodness! These are the perfect frying pans, for so many reasons! They are deep enough to fry just about anything and to make recipes with lots of ingredients. Nothing!! sticks to them. They are the most wonderful nonstick pans I’ve ever had! They distribute the heat evenly, and do well at both very low and very high temperatures. I have been frying chicken for over 40 years, but I made my best fried chicken ever a couple of weeks ago, and the only thing that was different was this frying pan! My husband isn’t the biggest fan of fried chicken, but he was going back for seconds! I can’t recommend these pans strongly enough. Don’t be put off by the color — the pans may look frivolous, with their pretty blue color, but they are hard-working and the best frying pans you’ve ever owned! Almost forgot — the lids are wonderful, too! Clear so you can see through them, and they lie flat for a good seal. They have that wonderful steam hole that every good frying pan lid should have! I really only have one complaint — I wish they made a slightly larger frying pan, too, for the times I’m frying food for a crowd! Ailwyn, if you could make a 12-13” frying pan, you’d make me very happy!

One thing that was nice was it came with its own screwdriver even though I personally have plenty, however, what did bother me is it came with two screws and a bunch of different washers and there was nothing I could find that told me what I was supposed to do with any of them. The screw itself was pretty self explanatory but I wasn’t sure if the other was needed elsewhere or if it was a spare and also I had no idea if I was supposed to use a washer, multiple washer, if it was up to preference, etc. Not sure if there was just another instruction book that didn’t get put in or if that’s just how it is but very confusing either way. Other than that, overall pretty solid pan.

First, the price is really good for what you get. The surface of the pan has been easy to clean and since mine gets daily use I would say overall it holds up pretty well to the many times I use it. But there are a couple of issues that should be noted.The first, if you will look at the pictures of this pan, you will see the handles are attached by screws. The Screw heads are inside the pan. These Screw heads are not Copper stick free screw heads, therefore if you make thick pancakes or thick omelets like I do, the egg will stick to these screw heads every time. Every Time. I have to spray these screws with Pam in order to use these without it sticking which kinda makes them ""almost non-stick"" instead of truely no-stick.Second, the hinges are weak. the hinges are made of the flimsiest of all flimsiest metals. The pan surface itself will outlast the hinges by a long shot. Since I use mine to make omelets, having the hinges is important in that it makes it really easy to flip the pan. What should last me many many years only last a few.All that being said, if they would fix these two issues, either construct these with the handles incorporated in the metal and affixed internally and make hinges that are truely made to last, I would easily pay double for one.

I tried every possible way to do this without oil, adhere to the instructions and it made an absolute mess, first side sticks, and when you try to flip it you get a big dripping mess of pancake batter streaming out of the pan and onto your stove. In order to get it to flip without oil you have to try to loosen it up with a spatula before flipping and what's the point if you need to use a spatula on this. However if you put a little oil before you put the pancake batter in, it will flip properly, sometimes with a little jerk down motion will make it drop. You don't need a lot of oil just a few drops swirl it around and you're good to go. Because this does work with oil I'm keeping it as it is a very nifty tool in the kitchen.

This thing was no exception, so why would I have bought it anyway? I had one and only one task for it in mind, and that so seldomly durability was not that important to me. My one use for it was to make one large pancake for myself for breakfast onto which I could put a fried egg or any other topping of my choice. So my first question, one that any manufacturer of such a product would have in big bold letters, was what is its diameter. Nowhere on their ad page could I find one word about that, only that it is “large” and that it is two-inches thick. I would never in my life expect to make a pancake two inches thick so I don’t know why I would want to know that.IT GOES DOWNHILLThe breathless worded ad copy continued in the royal tradition of the seen on TV tradition, including the extensive use of the word copper as if it has a health benefit. Okay there are some claims about wearing a pure copper bracelet that some say to have magical qualities but are you ready for the honest truth now? There isn’t evidence of an ounce of copper in this thing, it is only a copper colored non-stick coating, or at least supposedly non-stick. As if that farce wasn’t enough they actually go on to say, or make you think they say, that it is made from titanium encrusted with diamonds. That is so funny I can hardly type the words without laughing. No, it is aluminum with a copper colored coating. The cleverly worded fine print is that it has a “diamond sparkle look coating”. And the wording “titanium ceramic” seem to be some well disguised trademarked terminology. So much for believing what you see on TV.QUALITYIt doesn’t sound right to use the word quality in a sentence describing this thing, but to be fair it only cost twenty bucks, about what a cheap frying pan cost at the discount store. I always suggest to read the one star reviews first and this is a great example of that, they are spot on accurate and you know they aren’t planted by employees of the maker. They all point to the extremely bad hinge design that is uses two pop rivets that are almost guaranteed to break. Even being really careful with it it’s just not designed well. Yes but isn’t it true that I went ahead and bought it anyway? I admit to that, but I said earlier that I expected to use it maybe once or at the most twice a month, and the only thing that attracted me over an ordinary frying pan is I am really bad at turning pancakes over and the best ones are cooked equally on both sides. I didn’t want yet another electric appliance because most of them don’t heat 100% evenly anyway, this held the promise, weak as it was, that it could spread the heat more evenly on my electric stovetop and I told myself that if I wait until the pancake (or even an omelet) as half cooked it shouldn’t leak out if I flip it over really fast. That idea sort of works but if I can’t see the food cooking I would have to experiment many times to get it even half right. One detail I did not like was that the rivets used to attach the handles are prone to having food stick to the crevices, which would make it a chore to clean it.SIZE MATTERSMy opening thought was about the diameter. Not trusting gadgets like this I had high hopes that they weren’t trying to pull another fast one on me and that it wasn’t anywhere near as big as they make it look. My instincts were right, I had hopes this would make one pancake that’s big enough for an adult, that would be about nine inches, but no, the maximum working area inside the pan is only a meager five inches. Using their directions it would take me about five minutes to make one five inch pancake. If I wanted four of them, which I guess is a full stack, it would take me at least 20 minutes to make breakfast for myself. On the same subject, since the pan tapers down to around five inches it is smaller than the smallest burner on my stove, which means the rising heat would eventually scorch the entire pan.THE FINE PRINTHere’s the shocker. Cleverly hidden inside the box, looking like one of those warranty sheets that no one ever reads, on the reverse side is a contract. No seriously, it is a lengthy legal contract that tells you that you already agreed to a long list of terms and conditions when you pressed the “buy” button, including giving up your legal rights and having to pay your own costs for any legal action. I have never seen anything so audacious on any product in my life and that instantly dropped their rating to zero and I put the thing back in the box and returned it. As public notice I do not accept or agree to any conditions they say I agreed to by buying this thing and by accepting my return Gotham Steel/Emson has agreed to my terms which will be available to them upon written request. On every count this is thing is rejected.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 15, 2023', 'is_verified': True}]"

At that time, for whatever marketing reason, I thought of T-Fal as some lesser brand of cookware. I like expensive brand name cookware as much as the next person, but, when I asked a friend what they wanted for a bday present, they said a set of T-Fal. Ok, well, I\'d have bought you AllClad if you\'d have asked, but if that\'s what you want.After paying a little bit of nothing, then seeing the stuff in person, I thought, wow, I am gonna get another set for myself. This is nice stuff. So I did. And, with it being inexpensive and all, I used it really hard, like I didn\'t care if I had to replace it. I also overheated my 10"" skillet about as often as a pan can possibly be overheated.Now, I\'ll admit, after almost 20 years, the non-stick coating in several of the pans is not very non-stick any more. But, none of it is missing! No holes in the surface and all that stuff in my food.In spite of the insane temps I\'ve used the pans at, none of them have warped even a little bit. They are as flat as a pancake. I feel bad getting rid of my old trusty 10"" skillet, but, its replacement is here. I bought the 8"" thinking it would be a nice omelet pan but in truth, it\'s a bit too small for that. Nice pan, but, too small.My 8"" skillet didn\'t seem to work real well as an egg pan when I first got it. Eggs seemed to stick pretty good, and clearly I expected better. After frying something in it using coconut oil, it immediately became the non-stick pan I thought it would be. This new 10"" pan I broke in by boiling a shallow pool of water, then pouring that out and ""seasoning"" the pan with a good rub of coconut oil while over the heat. My first French omelet from this pan slid around like it was on an air cushion. Wonderful.This pan feels like a nicer quality pan than my 19 year old one. Though that one still looks nice, the balance of this one is nicer and the handle feels more sturdy. Not that it needed to be since that one isn\'t loose now. This one is also oven safe while the old one was not. The aluminum on the bottom of this is uncoated, where the old one I had was enameled. I use gas, and that one has needed the black crud cleaned off many times in the past. It cleans right up with ez-off, and I expect this one to also.Overall, I\'d say these are the nicest non-stick pan you can get at any price. Cooks Illustrated seems to feel the same way. When you hold this pan in your hand, it\'ll feel like a pan of 5x the price. And, if it lasts like my last one, it\'s worth 5x the price. If you\'re a person who loves quality cookware, consider putting a few pieces of T-Fal in your collection. It\'ll fit right in with others you spent a mortgage payment on.PS.

If a $30 pan gives it up after a year, who cares right? Well, this pan exceeded my expectations. On a gas stove, the aluminium heats up quickly (though it is prone to hot and cool spots) and cools off just as fast for easy cleanup. Compared to steel and cast iron, this is a time saver.As for the pan itself, the rubber handle always stays cool except sometimes nearest to the pan. Just be careful grabbing there if you\'ve had it on the burner for a while. Cleanup with a sponge and soapy water is all it takes. I wouldn\'t recommend the dish washer as in my experience, it won\'t always get all of the food off and then the heated dry kind of bakes it on. A quick hand wash takes care of that though.I haven\'t had any issues with the nonstick coating flaking or getting scratched off. I take care to use silicone utensils to cook with on these pans.So with the pan being easy to cook with, easy to clean, durable, and best yet, really cheap, I couldn\'t be happier.

Works well. Use with good habits', 'author': 'Luis Garcia', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I\'ll review this in order but overall if you want to know now this is the best ""cheap"" product I have ever purchased on amazon.Main points: Due to other reviews claiming the nonstick surface scratched off their pans I\'d recommend you Never use any metal items against this pans surface or else you will scratch off the nonstick surface (this goes with any pan but I guess it has to be restated here). Scratching off teflon is highly carcinogenic as well as for metal pans their coatings are also not good to ingest so get into the habit of not scratching your pans. Use wood or anything non metallic that can handle the high heat for cooking.Another thing to consider potentially based on other reviewers: Dont immediately cool down your pan (or any pans ever) if they have been heated or just taken off the heat. If you do then the surface of the teflon may crack as seen in other reviews.Another thing to NOT do is based on the assumption that the handle may not be perfectly secured (it\'s not a fusion or welded mold) the handle coating itself seems to be maybe glued or coated on the inner metal handle which may come off if you place the entire pan in your oven. This pan doesn\'t look like it\'s capable of being placed into an oven to roast your food. I wouldn\'t suggest it nor try it myself due to this minor potential quality ""flaw"". You shouldn\'t need to place the pan into the oven, it wasn\'t made for that.Heat Distribution - 5/5The pan heats up well if you have any issues it may be your electric stovetop taking a while to heat up itself. The pan cooks the sides of my food very well. Anything touching the pan or oil within the pan will be hot. If you are having issues it may be due to lack of contact with a hot part which may cause uneven heating of your food.Easy to Clean - 5/5The product has a very good nonstick surface and it makes the food that was cooked on the pan and even if the food was left on over night if you persoak the pan with soap then it will come right off due to that non stick surface. Use a rough sponge but dont use a steel wool since that will probably scratch the nonstick surface.Value for money - 5/5This product works and is very useful for the price. I\'d gladly order another pair when and if these pans do eventually fail but for now the coating is very nice and hasn\'t failed me yet in any capacity.This pan seems like a great value. It works incredibly well and if you treat it right and dont scratch the surface then it will last you as long as you can maintain good pan handling habits!Conclusion:If you want a durable pan that can handle your every mistake, this may not be for you. If you are a diligent owner that wants to preserve their pans and tools, then this will be perfect for you. I havent had any issues with my pans and I dont expect to. But if I do I\'ll detail in a revision/ edit of what occured and by what rough time frame from purchase that it occured.1 month of constant use from this post.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States June 5, 2020', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Heat transfers evenly over the surface, and light-weught handles prevent pans from tipping.', 'author': 'Ralph E.

The clean up is very easy since I usually wipe it out with a damp towel. I don’t recommend using a dishwasher if you can avoid it only because it can wear out the longevity of your pans lifespan. Hot water and a bit of soup will do for tougher to clean situations. Also, season your pan before use as directed and everything you make will be a breeze from pan to plate.

I’ve had a chance to try this out for a few batches of scrambled eggs and just tried an omelet this morning. I like a nice plump-with-fillings sort of omelet and this pan was a pinch too small for that. There wasn’t enough bottom of the pan width for the eggs to spread out enough to provide coverage for the amount of veggies I like. So that’s the 1 star deduction. “Make a less stuffed omelet!” cries the peanut gallery. Surely a possibility, but I’m not a fan of omelets where the innards seem like an afterthought rather than part of a balanced, harmonious breakfast meal. Plenty slick, nonstick-wise. I do use a bit of oil and butter to assist with flavor and slipperiness. I’ve had enough of the soaking and scraping with my stainless pans, and don’t want to be disappointed with this pan so I’ll work up to an oil-less attempt at scrambled eggs later. Not sure what technology some of the nonstick offerings on the market are to justify their $50 to $150 price tags. This one seems much more fairly priced. The handle is advertised as Bakelite, but it has a really nice satiny feel to it and is very comfortable in the hand, making flipping veggies easy when sautéing. Hopefully the seller/manufacturer will offer additional sizes for those folks who want a bit more real estate to work with when crafting omelets. It is deep enough to do some stovetop frying, and would handle smaller portions of French fries. Could probably fit a couple servings of tots, chicken tenders or fish sticks too. No lid included, so you’ll probably want a spatter screen.

This pan was a nicely priced option with some great reviews, so I thought I\'d give it a try.If you\'re asking yourself, ""Why two pans?"" I\'ll give you three reasons why. The first is non-stick pans wear out and wear out really quickly if you cook over high heat, like when you sear meat. This pan doesn\'t deteriorate when you heat it on high and will last a lifetime. Non-stick pans also don\'t work well for recipes where a sauté is deglazed into a sauce. Finally, as non-stick surfaces wear out, they deposit chemicals in the food you cook on them, and that bugs me.So I have this non-stick frypan, and I am very happy with it. It has a nice heft to it, heats evenly, does a great job of everything from searing to sautéing, and is genuinely easy to clean. We do a lot of home cooking here and, two months in, it still looks like new.I thought I\'d show you how easily this pan cleans up. The first picture I took was after a dinner where I sautéd all the vegetables for a veggie-heavy, one-pan zucchini-tomato-chickpea curry, then scooped up the leftovers and used a spatula to get the last of the sauce into two leftover storage containers. If you take a look at the picture, the pan was pretty clean even before it hit the sink. The second picture was taken a couple of minutes later after a drip of Dawn dish soap, some water, and few really quick swishes with a scrub brush cleaned it out, and this is what it looked like. No elbow grease was required. It shines!Here\'s one more cool thing about this pan: The lid for our 10-inch T-Fal E93897 non-stick pan is a great fit for this one, too. Having a well-fitting led comes in really handy so, if you\'re looking for that perfect pair of 10-inch standard and non-stick pans, this and the T-Fal might just be your perfect set.Pros:* Induction friendly.* Cooks evenly at every temperature.* No problems with warping.* Really great pan for not a lot of money.* Has been super easy to keep clean.* Mates well with the lid for T-Fal\'s 10-inch non-stick sauté pan, E93897.Cons:* I couldn\'t think of any!', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 20, 2021', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Yes!

If you really want to save money, spend the money and get All-Clad pans or similar professional pans as they will last a lifetime as they have lifetime warranty's.These are NOT professional grade pans as one reviewer claims. I am a Chef and professional pans are always tri-ply pans for even heat distribution. In allot restaurants that I have worked in and also at culinary school just use cheap aluminum pans make by Vollrath. I used a Vollrath pan to make a French Classic Omelette. They do not always want to spend money on good Tri=ply pans. However all chefs that I know used Tri-ply made of 18/10 grade stainless steel or Copper pans at home. Usually All-Clad or Calphalon. It all depends on what you are cooking. For non-stick pans I would say just go with a Vollrath non-stick pan. For cooking French Toast I just use a 12 inch T-Fal pan.

These are great. I got a two pan set from Target originally. The smaller frying pan was incredible. I had to be careful making scrambled eggs not to have them slide out of the pan while I cooked them. The bigger pan I used for pancakes mostly. I took them back to Target because of the bigger frying pan. It got a build up on the side walls pretty quickly that I couldn't get off and all just from making pancakes a few times. I was nervous because of some of the reviews I had read of people having problems with the pans, but I loved the smaller frying pan so much I bought some more individually.I now have this 8 inch pan, a 12 inch pan with a lid that I don't see on Amazon, and a sauce pot with a lid. All are great. I have had them about 6 months. I can still pretty much clean them with nothing more than a paper towel after cooking. I do wash them very gently with soap, but in a pinch they wipe out clean with a paper towel. The big frying pan again started to get a bit of a build up on the sides after pancakes, but I read another reviewer mention Bar Keeper's Friend cleanser. That stuff does the trick. As soon as a little stuff collects on the side that doesn't just wipe off, I use a tiny bit of that on a wet paper towel and the pan wipes clean as new.So far, I LOVE these. I will say, thought, that they feel a bit lighter than some of my older, more expensive pans. I like the weight of some of the other pans for no other reason than they just feel good being a bit heavy. These work great though, heat up quickly, distribute the heat well, and cool off quickly.NOTE: The manufacturer does suggest NOT using oils like EVOO because of the smoke point. I love olive oil and safflower oil. I avoid using EVOO with these, but I do use it sometimes and so far haven't had any issue. Always use an oil, though, even though it is non-stick. Cooking without an oil can ruin pans. Also, don't use a non-stick spray on non-stick pans.As for the Bar Keeper's Friend, I am using it based on someone else's review. It seems to work great, but I didn't do much research to see if it messes up the finish over time.NOTE: After several years of use and multiple Greenpan pots and pans, my extra advice is to always use oil to distribute heat evenly and do not let the pan get too hot. Excessive heat or prolonged heat on a dry pan has degraded the non-stick surface for me on a couple of pans.

I was worried about buying it with so many bad reviews saying it worked great for the first 2-3 months, then started sticking and cascading to spectacular failing. I decided to conduct a controlled experiment to see if I could use it for 2 months without any degradation in performance. I am the only person that uses this pan, so I no one else has used and possibly abused this pan, that's the controlled part of the experiment. I use this pan everyday to make a 2 egg omelet with different ingredients that vary day to day. I also like my eggs firm and just starting to brown.I started off using just a little bit of olive oil like I did with my old teflon coated pans. I soon stopped using oil because the pan was too slippery. My eggs almost slipped out of the pan when I picked it up preparing to flip the omelet on a few mornings. I only use a silicone rubber spatula with the pan to keep from scratching it. I always let the pan cool down to room temperature before cleaning it to prevent it from warping. I always use a soft soapy sponge to clean the pan, no abrasive cleaning tools like Scotch Brite sponges or Brillo pads. Stay away from anything that will scratch a metal pan. You can't see it, but they create micro scratches in the ceramic finish that give minerals and food a place to stick. Every time you use these scratching cleaning tools, they degrade your pan a tiny bit, even if you don't perceive it.That all sounds like what many other people and still had the pan fail 2-3 months after using it. There is one more thing that I do that I didn't read about in other reviews. I always dry it with a paper towel immediately after cleaning and rinsing the pan. If you let it air dry, you will have a build up of calcium and lime, common in tap water, especially in hard tap water. If you let it air dry, take a close look at the finish. If there are water spots, that's calcium and lime now stuck to your pan. Rewet the pan and wipe it dry with a tough paper towel with a polishing motion as you go. If you already have a buildup, you can try polishing it with baking soda and a wet paper towel. It should restore your pan to near new condition. So I've been almost burning my eggs for over 2 months now and don't use oil. For me the pan works just fine taking care of it as outlined above. If it has any flaw, it's that it doesn't come with the above care instructions."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 28, 2017', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Great Interior, But Very Difficult To Clean Exterior!', 'author': 'Lainey Girl', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'I am quite pleased with the ease of use of this GreenPan Lima 8 inch frying pan.

Still five stars!ORIGINAL POST:I loved this pan so much, I bought a second in the larger size. But I'll talk about the smaller one because it gets way more abuse. I don't know what people are doing to this pan, but I've used it daily (sometimes twice a day) for the entirety of the pandemic, and near-daily before that -- cooking eggs almost exclusively, at low heat AND high heat -- and it hasn't lost its non-stick capabilities. Perhaps people are not cooking, like, normally? If you don't want to use any cooking fat at all, that might cause problems. Ditto if you're constantly burning your food (which would lead to more stubborn polymerization). But if you don't have any super-power requirements, this pan is great.Few things I've noticed:1. Butter does a much better job than oil at coating the pan (oil likes to pool together in little islands), which does sometimes mean there's a tad more sticking with oil where it doesn't quite get under the food (but no more than a little nudge with a fork can fix). I like a butter/oil combo, personally.2. I always wash this in the dishwasher, but I've noticed that after a few weeks of high-heat cooking, I sometimes need to give it an extra hard scrub with a sponge to get any bits of lingering polymerization off, which completely restores any lost non-stick-ness.3. I don't care about this, but I always wipe the butter knife on the same part of the pan, which, over the years, has worn away the coating in that particular place. The underside of the pan has also become pretty unsightly--stained and patchy. None of this affects its performance, however."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States June 14, 2021', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Very nice and healthy Ceramic non stick', 'author': 'Summer', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I bought this pan because I wanted a healthy Ceramic and not a Teflon.

I have had them for a week and so far. I have cooked salmon with the skin, veggie burgers, ground beef burgers, steaks and scrambled eggs all of them slide around the pan. I have never seen this happen only if you used a ton of oil or on t.v. Also, you get the nice browning on your steaks and burgers as well.

The scramble eggs I used a bit of olive oil and they didn’t taste like pan spray, butter or oil normally they taste of the oil, or cooking spray since you have to use so much to stop them from sticking. These are great pans for someone starting as the food do not stick and the even cooking ensure you can walk away and prepare your other dish(s) confidently.

I’d been wanted to ditch my non-stick cookware for several years for health reasons but couldn’t find the right fit. I’m spoiled by growing up cooking with only non-stick cookware. And I’m NOT a good cook so I tend to overheat pans & burn food. AND I sooo dislike cleaning up after cooking that I’d prefer to do it later (like the next day). I’m possibly the worst case scenario for testing any cookware line. I’d honestly much rather enjoy being served nice meals in restaurants. But, I’m immunocompromised so COVID changed all that. So, I’ve needed to up my game & learn to cook decently.I first tested several brands of stainless steel cookware. It was a total nightmare for me to clean. I then tried out ceramic cookware but found it to be too heavy for my arthritic joints. After reading about and researching Hestan’s Nanobond’s titanium coating, I thought it sounded promising & ordered this pan. Besides, the design of all of Hestan’s cookware is simply gorgeous.This Hestan Nanobond pan turned out to be AMAZING. My 1st test was fried eggs that turned out perfect with no sticking and easy cleanup afterwards. I’d read to heat the pan first, then add the oil/butter next & let it heat, and to then add the eggs. That definitely works to make the surface as close to being non-stick without actually having a non-stick coating. I’ve used it repeatedly for sticky foods like fried eggs, scrambled eggs, grilled cheese sandwiches, etc. with thrilling results. Best of all, it’s easy to clean afterwards.The Hestan Nanobond cookware is fantastic & suits my needs perfectly. I’ve now bought many more of the pots and pans in all shapes & sizes. I’m thrilled with the good looks & performance of the Nanobond line, the ease of cleaning up afterwards, and the titanium coating’s overall forgivingness for bad cooks. I accidentally added ground sausage needing to be browned for a casserole directly to their still-warming 3.5 quart sauté pan. The sausage stuck immediately to the bottom & I knew I’d really screwed up. While stirring the rest of the meat with only a silicon spatula, however, the stuck remnants surprisingly released completely from the bottom! I then decided to go ahead & try baking the entire casserole in the covered Nanobond pan in the oven instead of dirtying up a casserole dish. The casserole turned out fantastic with perfectly browned sides & bottom. The servings easily released from the pan without falling apart. And the very baked-on food remnants STILL cleaned up easily. The beautiful design of Hestan’s cookware really makes it equally appealing for stove/oven to table presentation.

I am hesitant to buy the larger skillets if they are going to be super thin like the 8 inch is.BOTTOM LINE:I think I’m going to love this pan for scrambled eggs, and I don’t know what else.. I plan to try a reverse sear with salmon or a hamburger.. I usually slow cook vegetables in an enameled cast iron sauce pan, so I don’t have to worry about salt and other seasonings leaching the SS.. But I suppose I will try some vegetables in the nano bond titanium (as a little browning is supposed to add a layer of flavor.. but I suspect browning anything is less healthy).STICK, OR NOT TO STICK?Mystery solved.. I was perplexed by so many reviews complaining about things sticking to the titanium nanobond, because my scrambled eggs were sliding around, almost like a nonstick pan. I just watched a video comparison of three different stainless steel pans.. The Heston nanobond, and demeyere (both of which I have cooked scrambled eggs on).. In the video they got the pans hot until the water drops danced around, which I think of it as a trick that allows you to cook scrambled eggs in cast-iron.. Plus they used what looked like some kind of vegetable oil.. And the egg was stuck in the pan bad.. I use butter at a low temperature (which I believe is appropriate for eggs), and the eggs don’t stick at all..LEACHING INTO FOODI’ve always heard that titanium is extremely non-reactive, but I have been UNABLE to find any information (other than manufacturers claims) whether titanium cookware will leach anything into food while cooking (ie: acidic foods, like tomato paste, or how it’s well known that salt will pit stainless steel).. Titanium is supposed to be completely safe for humans, so we can only hope if anything leeches it would be pure titanium (manufacturers tend to be untrustworthy, I can only hope in Italy they have tighter regulations for such things than in America).. If you search the Internet you can find where testing was done with SS pans.. Some manufacturers claim you can cook tomato red sauce in them (even though tomatoes do leech from SS)..SUPER THIN?When I say super thin, perhaps I’m spoiled by using expensive aluminum clad cookware from other brands that have a hefty amount of aluminum.. Because of the high price of Heston nano bond cookware, they should pop for thick enough aluminum layer to where we should have to wonder if it’s enough.. And to be clear I don’t know how thick the aluminum layer needs to be to do. It’s job..The thin-ness of the pan makes me wonder if it would be prone to warping (with my other stainless steel pans, I clean them while they are hot, but I am fearful to put water into these thin nano bond skillets).. NOTE: I don’t put a lot of cold water into a hot pan, rather a little bit that steam cleans most of the pan (none of my pans have ever warped).HEAT MOMENTUM:The other problem with extra thin aluminum cladding is heat momentum.. Heat momentum is one of the reasons cast-iron pans work so well for certain things (such as putting a frozen hamburger patty, and getting heat momentum to create the seer.. instead of the frozen patty immediately cooling off the pan which destroys the seer). In my particular case, using the control freak induction burner that has a built-in temperature probe, it will probably compensate by instantly turning the power up (which I hear it doing when I take a little off, to try to maintain temperature).. I doubt the thin aluminum will work in this instance, if you’re trying to cook a frozen steak or anything substantial without cool in the pan off..NON-STICK:I have not used nonstick pans for decades, but I have been cooking scrambled eggs in aluminum clad stainless steel pans for years.. And for the past year. I’ve been using Demeyere SS skillets, which have a treated SS surface that concentrates the chromium and nickel and removes the iron (it makes the stainless steel, more stainless steel, and it does stick less than regular SS, but not by much)..[Again contrary to what many reviews are saying], when I cooked scrambled eggs in the Heston nanobond it felt like nonstick to me. There was an obvious non-stick quality even compared to my demeyere). Like my demeyere pans, I expect I will have to occasionally use the special cleaner, or barkeepers friend, to get rid of the haze/seasoning that develops (this is expected)..Likewise cleanup was very easy (like I would imagine non-stick would be).TOO—LIGHT—WEIGHT?I know other reviews think it’s thick/heavy, but it is by far the lightest pan I have ever held in my hands (and I’ve used a few different brands of aluminum clad stainless steel pans).. I realize titanium is light weight, but the nano bond is a very thin layer of titanium (presumably over stainless steel)..The pan is so light weight that it’s causing the problem with my control, freak induction burner.. The 8” or will sit flat by itself, but because it’s so light weight, and the handle is relatively heavy, it will not sit flat on the induction burner for preheating, because there is a temperature probe in the center (that has a lightweight spring)..And (when cooking anything sensitive to uneven heat) you very much need to preheat pans on an induction burner, because the nature of induction heats the pan itself so there is always a hot ring in the center of the pan that matches the induction ring (preheating for a while lets the heat spread out)..BOTTOM LINE: I was able to preheat the pan to cook my scrambled eggs, but one end of the pan was about 1/8” off the induction burner (and induction burners are sensitive to this.I WOULD HATE: to try to preheat the 8” pan for a seer on this induction burner (the 1/8” in the air might end up a huge problem at high power settings)..COOKING TECHNIQUES:There is technique to consider in whether eggs or anything sticks or not..For scrambled eggs I use low heat (228F.. since my induction burner controls the temperature).. and I use plenty of butter (I am convinced, low carb is healthy, and butter and egg yolks are healthy fats).. my eggs were sliding around the pan like the nonstick advertisements..CLEANUP:My experience with cleanup was like you would imagine nonstick. But I’ve seen many reviews complain about food sticking to the pan (I can only assume they were using high heat, and maybe little or no oil).. I can’t say for sure, but I know with my other stainless steel pans anytime something sticks, I just put a squeeze of dish soap and a little water and come back in an hour (or the next morning).. If I’m in a hurry, I’ll turn on the burner for a few seconds so warm soap will work faster.. Then whatever was stuck on usually falls off.. Sometimes I use vinegar (I don’t know whether dish soap vinegar would be more effective)..', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 20, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Very high quality in ALMOST every area.', 'author': 'Teddy', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'Pros: the finish looks beautiful as it’s slightly a smoky grey color which is very smooth and though not nonstick is less sticky than other stainless steel pans I’ve used.

Mostly small nitpicks but for an expensive pan small can be big depending on your taste. Pricey. On my induction top at least the pan bottom warps very slightly so as thin coat of oil tends to pool towards the outer edges of the pan, this pretty common in a lot of pans but i do wish at this price it could be avoided.

The other thing about the pan is, that it didn't have a lid, and none of the lids of my other pans fit it. So, I have been looking for a new non-stick frying pan with a lid. I really wanted to get one made from cast aluminum, not stamped aluminum, because it's thicker and holds the heat better, distributes heat better, less likely to warp, more likely to stay flat on the bottom, and doesn't have those two little shiny rivet heads that always get food stuck on them and are impossible to get clean. After sifting through hundreds of options I finally selected this Vinchef deep frying pan with a lid. I really was looking for a pan that would be shallower, but I couldn't find one with a lid, so I had to get one that was a bit deeper so I could get one with a lid. I noted the comments regarding the pour spouts so the lid doesn't seal completely, but in the time that I have been using it I have not found that to be a disadvantage. The only food that I have got to stick was when I was steaming some broccoli and put some slices of American cheese on it. One slice got up on the side of the pan and cooked there, and I had to scrub it off, but everything else has been very much non-stick. I really like the pan, the only downside was in assembly, the Phillips head screw that you have to use to put the handle on doesn't go in very well. Even though I think I have the screw in all the way, the handle still feels just a bit loose. I'm afraid to screw it in any further for fear of breaking it. So, it works. I like the fact that the pan fits very nicely inside my 12 inch Farberware stainless steel frying pan for storage. I put the glass lid on it upside down for storage, and everything goes in the drawer very neatly.

I looked for a pan that was not Teflon that had some thickness and looked like it might last. I also wanted a pan that was guaranteed food safe.This pan is thick and sturdy, and it heats evenly. It is raised very slightly from the outside towards the center, which has both pros and cons, but the raised middle is so slight that it is barely noticeable, and I would not hesitate to cook an omellete in it. It does let the grease drain towards the outside of the pan rather than staying under the food, which it nice. I like the glass cover that lets me see food as it cooks, and it is about as easy to clean as any other glass lid.One caution: the directions say to never use the pan above medium heat, and I have been careful not to do that. Even on medium, the pan heats quickly and gets hot enough, and I have found that at medium temperature the pan cooks very evenly without burning or scorching. However, my gas stove does not have a really high flame or get as hot as some other gas stoves even on the burner with the highest btu, and people with stoves that get really hot will need to be very careful and might need to use low heat rather than medium to avoid damage to the pan. It will depend upon individual stoves. So far, nothing sticks, although I have not tried really sticky cheese yet. It cleans up very nicely with soap and water, and I have not had to scrub it. Time will tell whether or not that lasts.The handle is wood look-alike, and it stays cool when cooking on a stove top. It is very wide - especially where it joins the pan - which makes the pan steadier to hold and pour with less strain on my hand and wrist and without slipping or over-tipping.The only reason for 4 stars is that I personally find this pan kind of ugly because of the speckling and the light-colored wood look-alike handle.

If I like the look of the product, or the reviews of the product sit right with me, I will most likely purchase it. So, I didn\'t really care that these skillets are ""Rachel Ray.""I bought them for the color and the size. I was looking for small, non stick skillets to replace my worn out ones and in that regard they are awesome. I cook daily, at least 2-3 times a day on medium, low heat only. Nothing sticks on em. I cannot say if they are dishwasher safe as I don\'t remember if it said that on the product description, but cleaning them is really easy. I pre-rinse with hot water and remove whatever grime or oil was left after use with the spraying hose, I then just simply use the soft side of the sponge to clean the skillets cooking side, and use the rough side to clean the rest of the skillet. The no stick coating still remains solid. Do not rinse the skillets right after cooking. Let them cool down or it may warp your skillets.The color of the skillets... Its soo nice. I purchased the orange ones. At first, it was a really bright orange color that pop\'d. Now, its a lighter shade of orange mixed with the brighter orange color and it just looks great. The only way I can describe the color is by relating it to the color of cream filled orange Popsicle. As you bite into the Popsicle, the cream mixes with the orange and it produces this delicious lighter shade of orange. Idk, it just works, haha.I really only use the smaller of the 2 skillets as I bought the bundle that has the 9 and 11 inch, or something along those lines. I felt there was no need to use the larger one as the smaller one is able to cook everything I need.The handles on the skillets are pretty solid too. Good grip and feel heavy (the skillet as a whole.) The rubber does not get hot when picking up the skillets.Would definitely purchase again.

Anything you cook on it, no matter how much spray you use, it would be left with a coating of food. I told the wife we should get a new pan, another Rachael Ray, and she scoffed, ""Pans are too expensive, we\'ll wait for a sale"". Yeah, we both work so a $24 pan (when I bought it) is SUPER expensive...well, I bought the pan (in a pretty blue) and even though she was slightly annoyed I bought the pan even though she said not to, her tune changed immediately after trying it out.

(We like having one larger pan in our set.)When the pan arrived, the non-stick finish had a few little tiny imperfections; 4 or 5 tiny little bubble-like spots in the surface . . the type of thing you\'d almost think you could pick off with your nail. Since this was brand new, we decided to have it replaced and amazon.com, of course, instantly sent us a return label and shipped another one off.The second one arrived and it had no marks at all. The pans have a bit of heft but they\'re not particularly heavy; they feel well made and the handle is really comfortable. I\'d almost forgotten what it was like to cook in something that\'s really non-stick, after all these years of facing surfaces on our old cookware, and true to its word, nothing sticks on this pan.We\'ve only cooked a few things so far but it\'s been a pleasure using this cookware.There are two thing that bother us, though. (Not including the fact we needed a replacement*)The first thing is that there\'s no lid for the pan and none of the lids from the cookware set fit on the pan. As far as I can tell, there\'s no lid even available . . that\'s too bad \'cause all the other pans have lids and it puts some limitations on usage. Second, since the surface can be scratched, it would be nice if they shrink wrapped the pan so that nothing could mark it up. This was just wrapped in paper in a box.I\'ll update this someday, when we\'ve had some time to really cook with it.*So far this is a solid 4-star pan. Normally, I would take a way a star because the first one was scratched but I\'m in a generous mood. REALLY generous, in fact, \'cause when we received the full cookware set, of the same style, the smallest pan also had a tiny imperfection in the surface. They couldn\'t just replace the small pan so we had to send back the entire set. The next set that came had the exact same thing; there was one tiny little spot in the smallest pan . . . we picked it off and, though you can just make out where it was, it doesn\'t seem to have penetrated the actual non-stick surface. We\'ve decided to cook with it for a while and then reevaluate in a few months. If that spot shows any signs of problems, we\'ll return the one pan via the warranty. Still, when you purchase these pans, take a really close look at the surfaces. (That said, the small pan has been perfect so far . . . non-stick eggs every morning!)UPDATED: January 10, 2013Just thought I\'d check in on this review. We\'ve taken care of this pan (and the whole companion set that we bought at the same time) as best we could. We haven\'t put it in the dishwasher and only use softer utensils and sponges. We\'ve also never used it on really high heat. The non-stickiness has remained as new. There are no scratches or pieces starting to wear off and show up in the food. It still distributes the heat nicely and we have no complaints about cooking in this pan. That said, there are a couple of things we\'ve noticed. First, like a couple of other people mentioned, the outside of the pan (particularly on the bottom) can get nicked up a bit, especially if you\'re stacking pans. The finish still looks great but I can see you have to be careful about knocking these around too much. The only negative thing is that the pan warped a little bit after a few weeks of use. Again, we haven\'t ever used high heat but, though not dramatic, there is definitely a little bit of ""non-roundness"" to the top of the pan now. As I mentioned, though, we have a full set of these also and no other pots or pans have warped at all; it could just be this particular one.All in all, we still love the pan.

M. Czechowicz', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I was on the prowl for a new skillet, as my last one, of the granite variety, had lost its nonstick ability. I've been through a ton of skillets for the same reason: Tfal, Cuisinart, Calphalon, GraniteStone, etc. I was intrigued by this one because it had tall sides, a lid, and was blue. When it came in, I discovered it actually has mermaid type scales on the side and color shifting glitter on the outside as well. It's really quite pretty. But I didn't buy it for beauty. I bought it because I was tired of scraping burnt cottage cheese out of my granite or cast iron skillet every morning. No matter what temperature I used or what time I added it, the cheese in my eggs always stuck. Not any more! Not only did it not stick, but all I had to do to clean it after I was done was use a dry paper towel and it was spot free (see my first photo). The surface is much less textured than granite or cast iron. I'm exceedingly impressed...and happy I won't be soaking skillets anytime soon!There are many other benefits of this skillet in addition to it being completely nonstick. The deep sides are truly deep, as you can see in the photo of the glittery scales, it holds a lot of food. I have a bad habit of flipping food out of more low profile skillets, but have not had that problem with this one, which means less time scrubbing my stove top clean. The lid is also a nice little piece of engineering as the rubber around the ring helps prevent moisture from bubbling out or over the sides hither, thither, and yon. Instead it escapes from two specific places marked on either side of the lid (photo 3). Unlike the metal rimmed lids that have scalded me in the past, I can turn the lid so that steam escapes where I want it and I can attend to other pots and pans on the stove without worrying about being burned. It's sturdy, but not as heavy as cast iron. It heats evenly and the handle never gets hot. It comes with a Phillips screwdriver so you can attach the handle. All in all, I'm very pleased with my purchase and have found no cons.

The non-stick is very slick, and gives a good sear. The lid fits well, and the silicone edging seems sturdy - I'll stand it on edge while I'm cooking, and it hasn't warped yet. Only minor hot-spotting on a gas range - gets up to temp quick, and the heat is impressively consistent for how light weight it is. Not cast iron level, obviously, but it's on par with our Calphalon pan of similar diameter that weighs twice as much.So far I've used this to brown ground meat, saute aromatics, make gravy, cook burgers, simmer broth, make french toast and omelettes (no stuck egg residue, perfect bake/steaming in the pan with lid on the stovetop), and heat syrup (swirls and pours out cleanly, no stirring implement necessary).

I really don’t fry an awful lot, but when I do, I can’t wait to get out my beautiful blue frying pan! When I realized that the nonstick coating was failing on 2 of my old skillets, I started shopping around in stores and here on Amazon. Many of the reviews for these Ailwyn frying pans were over-the-top, so I ordered both the 9” and 11” pans. Oh my goodness! These are the perfect frying pans, for so many reasons! They are deep enough to fry just about anything and to make recipes with lots of ingredients. Nothing!! sticks to them. They are the most wonderful nonstick pans I’ve ever had! They distribute the heat evenly, and do well at both very low and very high temperatures. I have been frying chicken for over 40 years, but I made my best fried chicken ever a couple of weeks ago, and the only thing that was different was this frying pan! My husband isn’t the biggest fan of fried chicken, but he was going back for seconds! I can’t recommend these pans strongly enough. Don’t be put off by the color — the pans may look frivolous, with their pretty blue color, but they are hard-working and the best frying pans you’ve ever owned! Almost forgot — the lids are wonderful, too! Clear so you can see through them, and they lie flat for a good seal. They have that wonderful steam hole that every good frying pan lid should have! I really only have one complaint — I wish they made a slightly larger frying pan, too, for the times I’m frying food for a crowd! Ailwyn, if you could make a 12-13” frying pan, you’d make me very happy!

Kinda hefty but it’s a larger pan so makes sense. Non-stick seems to work fine but you need to be a lot more careful and read the instructions that come with it to make sure you don’t put in the dishwasher and don’t try scraping at burnt on food immediately you need to get it under warm soapy water sooner than later or else it can effect the coating. One thing that was nice was it came with its own screwdriver even though I personally have plenty, however, what did bother me is it came with two screws and a bunch of different washers and there was nothing I could find that told me what I was supposed to do with any of them. The screw itself was pretty self explanatory but I wasn’t sure if the other was needed elsewhere or if it was a spare and also I had no idea if I was supposed to use a washer, multiple washer, if it was up to preference, etc. Not sure if there was just another instruction book that didn’t get put in or if that’s just how it is but very confusing either way. Other than that, overall pretty solid pan. Looks nice, very versatile as you can cook anything from a simple grilled cheese all the way up to like a stir fry or even some type of sauce based meal if you choose, and non-stick seems like it should last quite a while if I take care of it right.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 10, 2021', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars I love this skillet!', 'author': 'Shelby S.

Seasoning is necessary for both.', 'author': 'Judy L.', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I have been a user of cast iron pans for over 15 years. Many of the cast iron pans I have are very old, and were crusted pans that I had to strip the crud off them and season them before they could be used. Some are newer preseasoned pans that I often stripped the seasoning from them to season them again.When I discovered the carbon steel pans, I was intrigued as these pans are much lighter than cast iron. As a point of reference, I also have a number of Le Creuset and Staub pans and Dutch ovens that I love, but are also very heavy and relatively expensive. Before buying, I usually do research to find out about products I am not familiar with.In my research, I found out that materials used in carbon steel and cast iron pans are basically the same except that carbon steel contains 99% iron and 1% carbon vs. cast iron that contains 2%-3.5% carbon and less iron. The additional carbon causes cast iron to be more brittle, so pans are made thicker to help prevent breakage which also makes them much heavier. Since both have a high iron content, they must be oiled to prevent oxidation and rust. Both have pores that absorb oil when heated, hence the creation of the non-stick properties through ""seasoning"", but the pores in carbon steel are microscopic and much smaller than the pores in cast iron. Because of this, much less oil should be used to season carbon steel than cast iron. If you use too much oil, or do not remove the excess oil as the pans cool, you will end up with a sticky residue on the pan. This is true for both carbon steel and cast iron, and both require some simple maintenance by heating them and coating them with oil after each use. I, personally, use Crisco All Vegetable shortening.A couple reviews mentioned flaking of the surface after use. These pans come preseasoned and coated with a layer of wax to prevent oxidation (rust). The layer of wax must be cleaned off per the instructions before the first use. This is done by washing them in warm soapy water and wiping them with a scrubby sponge to get all the wax off. If this isn\'t done, the wax will flake off when used the first time.At this point, I truly love these pans and will likely sell some of my treasured cast iron. So, what do I love about these pans. 1 - They are so much lighter in weight than cast iron. 2 - These pans are nonstick with the seasoning already on the pans and only gets better with time and proper seasoning after each use. 3 - Carbon steel, as well as cast iron, will continue to look like new if cleaned and seasoned after each use. 4 - Heats and cools much faster than cast iron. For both, medium to medium high heat is all that is needed. 5 - Can be used on the stove and in the oven as well as an induction cook top. 6 - Since carbon steel cools faster than cast iron, it is less likely to burn foods that are not immediately removed. 7 - Nest together well and take less storage space than most other pan. 8 - Can stack together and use metal utensils without the fear of scratching them.In conclusion, I would definitely recommend these pans if you are willing to take the time to maintain them. If you can do this, they will last for years to come.UPDATE 03/31/22:I have 3 of these pans in 8"", 10"", and 12"" sizes, and the two pictured are the ones I have used the most. In the last 4 weeks, I have used these pans quite often, and so far, they are totally non-stick and have not changed in color as I expected them to. Maybe it is something in the way I take care of them. After using them, they are washed with soap and water without any scrubbing. I totally dry them by heating them on the stove to open the pores of the pan, and then add a very small amount of Crisco oil on a paper towel to coat them with oil. After a couple more minutes of heating, I use a paper towel to remove any excess oil. As they cool, more oils beads on the surface of the pan, and this is again wiped off. Before I store them, I wipe them again with a kitchen towel. Although I fully expect these pans to change color over time, it\'s possible they stay looking nice by not letting excess oils stay on them. I do know that leaving excess oil on these pans or on cast iron pans will cause a sticky residue to develop. Built up oils on these pans or cast iron will cause them to look really cruddy and will reduce the nonstick capabilities of both.UPDATE 4/07/22:Today, I found out something about carbon steel pans the hard way. Cooking acidic foods in a carbon steel pan removes the seasoning. I made brats with sauerkraut in one of my carbon steel pans. I browned the brats, and then added the sauerkraut to the pan to heat it with the brats. The pan was fine until I cleaned it and found that part of the seasoning was gone. The pan was down to the bare grey metal in spots. Although this doesn\'t damage the pan, it has to be heated, oiled, and cooled a couple of times to season it again and regain the nonstick qualities of the pan. I also want to mention that when searing meat, you need to get a good sear on the meat before turning it. If you don\'t, the meat will stick.UPDATE 5/13/22:I have added pictures of my 8"" and 10"" pans that have been used quite a lot since I got them a couple of months ago. I am extremely happy with the nonstick quality of these pans and that they are so very much lighter than my cast iron pans. After every use, I season them as described previously, and so far they haven\'t changed in color. Personally, I believe this is because I don\'t let the oil burn on the pan when I season it as I have also found this to be true with my cast iron pans. All of my cast iron is an even dark black color and also nonstick. In the past, I have had a couple of cast iron pans change color when oil had been left on it for too long and burned. Although the color of the pans will get darker with use and seasoning, I don\'t think they have to become ugly if the patina is developed evenly.I hope this review was helpful for you.

How to Keep it Non-stick/UPDATED"", 'author': 'dsk', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'UPDATE 12/20/2024:I loved the 10"" skillet so much, I bought the 12"". They are my goto skillets, without a doubt. I use them daily, many times more than once per day. These are the only pans that I use to make eggs. So, my Merten and Storck fry pans have been used dozens and dozens of times. I\'ve ordered an induction range which will arrive day after tomorrow. These pans will work great on the induction cooktop. I\'ll update with info on how they do with induction and how I have to adapt.I was making tuna patties tonight in the 12"" pan. To this day, both pans are non-stick, and I mean so darn slippery that it takes a spatula plus another implement on the other side to flip anything. Even fried eggs just slide around. The pans are almost too slippery.I detailed how to season the pans to keep them nonstick in my original review. I\'ve learned that after reheating and rubbing oil on them a few times that it becomes unnecessary. They\'ll stop soaking up the oil. When you see this, then simply wash them under hot water (when they\'ve cooled down) and dry. I rarely use dish detergent. I have a BLUE 3M scrubber that I use. I only use the BLUE, because it\'s non-scratch. If I think the pan needs more, I\'ll put a very small amount of Dawn on the scrubbing pad, wet it in hot water, wash, rinse, and dry. That\'s all there is to it. I\'ve had no issues with rust. My pans hang on the wall. You can see where oil has polymerized in a couple of places on the cooking surface. This is correct and what it\'s supposed to do. Don\'t scrub it off! It\'s a part of the seasoning. There are 2 things I never do:1. I never soak the pans.2. I never run cool or tepid water into a hot pan to clean it. I always cool them down. Original review:I\'ve read reviews where people think these pans are coated with a nonstick material; they aren\'t. I\'ve also read that you should treat them like cast iron; you DON\'T. Here\'s the right information.First, the pans may have a bluish hue. It\'s not from an applied finish. When you heat carbon steel, you get blue heat marks. Certain metals will so this when heated. You see it more readily in silver colored pans and it\'s natural.These pans are extremely preseasoned. I fried eggs over easy this morning, and they slipped around the pan so much, I had a hard time turning them! This is how you want these pans to perform. I have a carbon steel wok (that was Not pre-seasoned) and I\'ve never had one thing stick in it.Unlike cast iron, you should wash your COLD carbon steel pan, using dish soap, rinsing well. Never ever put a hot pan in cool water; it\'ll warp.After washing and drying, sit your skillet back on the stove. Turn it on to medium-low. Heat the pan. When the pan is hot, use a paper towel to apply cooking oil. You can use olive oil. I think a higher temp oil is better, like corn or vegetable oil. Don\'t let the pan overheat. Just rub the oil around. You\'ll see it disappear into the pan. When the pan isn\'t taking anymore, turn off the burner. After the pan cools, simply wipe off any excess oil and put it away.That\'s all there is to it. Don\'t put in the dishwasher. Just hand wash with dish soap, dry it, heat on a burner and apply oil. It\'ll stay extremely slick.BTW, if you buy a pan that isn\'t seasoned, it\'ll come with a coating of shellac on it to protect against rust. You have to heat it on high heat and burn the shellac off, scrubbing the soot. When you\'re done, the pan looks like these pans, black with a bluish hue.The 10"" skillet is a nice weight without being too heavy. The metal handle doesn\'t get hot when cooking on the stove.

It also doesn't hold much heat like cast iron, so you are constantly fiddling with the flame to keep it cooking but not burning, but it does a decent job of distributing the heat.With regard to seasoning: if you cook tomato anything, bye-bye seasoning. Any acidic food is a no-no unless you're ready to re-season.Cleanup: highly recommend the method of scrubbing it with coarse salt and a paper towel. This is safe and removes the gunk while leaving the seasoned layer alone. Try to keep water and soap away from your carbon steel pan!

Worth noting if you're used to Teflon coated pans you might have some trouble. When new, Teflon pans are so non-stick you really don't need any fat in them. Cast iron, carbon steel, and stainless all rely on sufficient fat to make them work. You should also get them a bit hot before you drop the fat in. In a 10in pan like this, I use almost 2 tablespoons of butter before dropping in a few eggs for frying. With this pan, they slide around like crazy when I jiggle the pan.This is my first carbon steel pan. I notice they're very much like cast iron in a lot of ways, but much better in two important characteristics.The first is that they are much lighter. This is obvious, but after using cast iron for a while it's easy to appreciate how much easier it is to flip food with a simple motion of the pan rather than needing a spatula.The second is that, unless most cast iron on this price range, the carbon steel pan is smooth. This makes it super slick when you use it right.Last, like others have noted, you need to take some care when you're done to make sure it keeps working. It becomes second nature after a while. Most of the time I just wipe it out with a paper towel till it looks clean. If there are stuck on bits, I'll use hot soapy water till it's clean and then heat till dry then do a super thing oil coating and let it smoke for a little. Stays slick and is pretty easy.Unless you warp the pan, you can always sand it down and reseason as though it's new.

Cons are making sure you clean it and season it after each use - which really takes about five minutes, including time to heat pan for oil.Don\'t let seasoning put you off getting a carbon steel pan - really easy - when pan cools, clean it with some kosher salt and paper towel (although I occasionally use water and detergent), rinse out, let air dry, put on stove and heat for about 3-4 minutes medium high heat. Then turn heat off, add about a quarter (money_ sized drop of grapeseed oil, swirl around to get coverage over whole pan, then wipe off excess oil and you\'re done.I considered the Lodge equivalent of this pan at the time, and bought both to compare because I prefer made in USA. Ultimately went with this one though primarily because it was lighter and larger than Lodge. However, if I could pick up a heavier pan, I would\'ve gone with Lodge. As you can see in pics, Lodge heavier because steel is thicker. And while this says ""Germany"" on cardboard that came with Merten pan, if you turn it over it is made in China. Other comps I noted are base of Lodge seemed better, handles were about the same (both quite long!), finish on Lodge pan was rougher, while that on this pan is smoother.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 3, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Awesome lightweight pan', 'author': 'Kimberly', 'rating': 4, 'content': ""We've been using this pan daily for over a year and it's a great addition to our otherwise cast iron only house. It's obviously much lighter weight than a similar sized cast iron. We didn't trust the pre-season (who knows what it was made of!) so we stripped it off immediately and began the seasoning process from scratch. We still haven't achieved an all-over even seasoning, probably because we use a steel spatula most of the time which scratches and wears on the surface, and therefore it isn't perfectly non-stick, but that's okay. My husband, bless his heart, sometimes puts the pan in the sink and allows water to sit on it which produces rusty spots pretty quickly, but they're easy to remove. For the most part, we treat the pan like cast iron - after the pan has cooled, clean with hot water only (no soap unless we really have to, or we will boil water in the pan to loosen gunk), evaporate over a hot burner, apply oil to the hot pan, and then let cool.The first photo shows the pan after cooking ground beef, the second photo is after cleaning with just water and then oiling."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 27, 2024', 'is_verified': True}]"

I have used this pan to make them for years now and I wanted to point out a couple of issues that may not be readily noticeable. But first I will talk about the plusses to this item. First, the price is really good for what you get. The surface of the pan has been easy to clean and since mine gets daily use I would say overall it holds up pretty well to the many times I use it. But there are a couple of issues that should be noted.The first, if you will look at the pictures of this pan, you will see the handles are attached by screws. The Screw heads are inside the pan. These Screw heads are not Copper stick free screw heads, therefore if you make thick pancakes or thick omelets like I do, the egg will stick to these screw heads every time. Every Time. I have to spray these screws with Pam in order to use these without it sticking which kinda makes them ""almost non-stick"" instead of truely no-stick.Second, the hinges are weak. the hinges are made of the flimsiest of all flimsiest metals. The pan surface itself will outlast the hinges by a long shot. Since I use mine to make omelets, having the hinges is important in that it makes it really easy to flip the pan. What should last me many many years only last a few.All that being said, if they would fix these two issues, either construct these with the handles incorporated in the metal and affixed internally and make hinges that are truely made to last, I would easily pay double for one. It does a good job for what I need it to do and would be a tremendous product if they addressed these two issues.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 21, 2021', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Works as advertised.', 'author': 'Stephen Worley', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Have used this item quite a number of times.

In order to get it to flip without oil you have to try to loosen it up with a spatula before flipping and what's the point if you need to use a spatula on this. However if you put a little oil before you put the pancake batter in, it will flip properly, sometimes with a little jerk down motion will make it drop.

This thing was no exception, so why would I have bought it anyway? I had one and only one task for it in mind, and that so seldomly durability was not that important to me. My one use for it was to make one large pancake for myself for breakfast onto which I could put a fried egg or any other topping of my choice. So my first question, one that any manufacturer of such a product would have in big bold letters, was what is its diameter. Nowhere on their ad page could I find one word about that, only that it is “large” and that it is two-inches thick. I would never in my life expect to make a pancake two inches thick so I don’t know why I would want to know that.IT GOES DOWNHILLThe breathless worded ad copy continued in the royal tradition of the seen on TV tradition, including the extensive use of the word copper as if it has a health benefit. Okay there are some claims about wearing a pure copper bracelet that some say to have magical qualities but are you ready for the honest truth now? There isn’t evidence of an ounce of copper in this thing, it is only a copper colored non-stick coating, or at least supposedly non-stick. As if that farce wasn’t enough they actually go on to say, or make you think they say, that it is made from titanium encrusted with diamonds. That is so funny I can hardly type the words without laughing. No, it is aluminum with a copper colored coating. The cleverly worded fine print is that it has a “diamond sparkle look coating”. And the wording “titanium ceramic” seem to be some well disguised trademarked terminology. So much for believing what you see on TV.QUALITYIt doesn’t sound right to use the word quality in a sentence describing this thing, but to be fair it only cost twenty bucks, about what a cheap frying pan cost at the discount store. I always suggest to read the one star reviews first and this is a great example of that, they are spot on accurate and you know they aren’t planted by employees of the maker. They all point to the extremely bad hinge design that is uses two pop rivets that are almost guaranteed to break. Even being really careful with it it’s just not designed well. Yes but isn’t it true that I went ahead and bought it anyway? I admit to that, but I said earlier that I expected to use it maybe once or at the most twice a month, and the only thing that attracted me over an ordinary frying pan is I am really bad at turning pancakes over and the best ones are cooked equally on both sides. I didn’t want yet another electric appliance because most of them don’t heat 100% evenly anyway, this held the promise, weak as it was, that it could spread the heat more evenly on my electric stovetop and I told myself that if I wait until the pancake (or even an omelet) as half cooked it shouldn’t leak out if I flip it over really fast. That idea sort of works but if I can’t see the food cooking I would have to experiment many times to get it even half right. One detail I did not like was that the rivets used to attach the handles are prone to having food stick to the crevices, which would make it a chore to clean it.SIZE MATTERSMy opening thought was about the diameter. Not trusting gadgets like this I had high hopes that they weren’t trying to pull another fast one on me and that it wasn’t anywhere near as big as they make it look. My instincts were right, I had hopes this would make one pancake that’s big enough for an adult, that would be about nine inches, but no, the maximum working area inside the pan is only a meager five inches. Using their directions it would take me about five minutes to make one five inch pancake. If I wanted four of them, which I guess is a full stack, it would take me at least 20 minutes to make breakfast for myself. On the same subject, since the pan tapers down to around five inches it is smaller than the smallest burner on my stove, which means the rising heat would eventually scorch the entire pan.THE FINE PRINTHere’s the shocker. Cleverly hidden inside the box, looking like one of those warranty sheets that no one ever reads, on the reverse side is a contract. No seriously, it is a lengthy legal contract that tells you that you already agreed to a long list of terms and conditions when you pressed the “buy” button, including giving up your legal rights and having to pay your own costs for any legal action. I have never seen anything so audacious on any product in my life and that instantly dropped their rating to zero and I put the thing back in the box and returned it. As public notice I do not accept or agree to any conditions they say I agreed to by buying this thing and by accepting my return Gotham Steel/Emson has agreed to my terms which will be available to them upon written request. On every count this is thing is rejected.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States October 15, 2023', 'is_verified': True}]"

I had T-fal when I got my first apartment- it was given to me as a gift and my first complete set of cookware ever. So when it came time to purchase a new cookware set, I went through Amazon and saw T-fal- for everything you got in the twelve-piece set, and you couldn't beat the price- and I knew it was top-of-the-line cookware (in my opinion), from previous use.Everything I needed was in the set- except for the bigger cooking pot. So I bought my birthday present for myself. And yes, cookware is a gift item, in my opinion, even when bought for the home- because it is so nice. And there was nothing more that I wanted than some good cookware to make my life easier- and nicer- to make better food for my loved ones.Let me tell you about the video I made to illustrate my point- of how T-fal is top of the line, high quality made and no other line can give you what T-fal does, at the price- Please excuse that I had to make the video by myself. And I had no stick to hold my phone- only one hand and the other- and these old hands have nerve damage and problems so know that I tried my best.I mixed an egg and poured it into the bare pan- meaning no butter, no oil, just the egg mixture (which was only eggs beaten in my mixing cup). Watch as I cook it (one-handed, the other videoing), and how nothing sticks, it all came up great-- you can see for yourself how nothing sticks!!And, in the video- look and see that there are no signs of oil, butter, or anything that could help the egg not stick. (And excuse the large scraper- while I could have used the one that came with the set- I figured instead of unpacking it, I'd use the one that we had out). All that is there to help prevent sticking is the wonderfulness of T-fal's non-stick technology. Honestly, it was all amazing- to again cook with T-fal and see the wonders of great heat distribution (which also helps the non-stick), along with the non-stick elements.Had I known what would happen next, I would have kept the video rolling but one-handed and all, I quit as early as I could- not knowing how to edit videos either (yet). But I took the pan to the sink to wash it- all I really needed to do- and did- was take a paper towel and wipe the access off. And then it was sparkling clean- nothing left to wash. The picture I included after the video was the pan after it was wiped out with a paper towel, no other cleaning was needed (or done). Especially since no butter or oil was used. And even though the egg was a little bland without anything to grease the pan- I added a little salt and thought how much better my health would be- without clogging my pores with oil and butter.All the T-fal in the set are that amazing. And while I would add more photos of it- the pan is the smallest of the set that I used- all the others look as they appear online in photographs- you don't really need my extra photos because they look the same at home as they do on Amazon.I think the set I had was great for me when I was younger- because at that time I hadn't mastered cooking in a way that made me want to be patient- cook right- and spend the time doing it. Youth can be that way. This is why this set is great- it makes up for the error of youth and the impatience- because that is normally when you are going to get things that stick to the pan- with that kind of attitude. So if you are looking for anyone's set of first cookware- you have found it.But now I take the time to cook and do it well. Even master complicated dishes that take a long time.- however, I want some good cookware to do this. T-fal is still the best for me. Also- for those health issues I have- I would like to cut out added butter and oil- especially when I use it just for the non-stick element and the recipe would be great, still, without it. As you saw in my video- no butter or oil is needed.I am so happy that T-fal has stayed affordable, and even become more affordable over time. This whole set was an amazing price- I didn't pay more than $10 per item- with all that was included- which is amazing when you look at the quality. A small pan that works this well should see for over $20 on its own.Thanks to T-fal for being such a large part of my life- and making it so much easier with the best cookware ever!Please note: I shot the video with one hand to work on everything, the other was on the camera. Sorry I'm not really set up to make great videos- wish I was but I tried my best to show how great the pan is. Also, the second photo shows it after cooking the eggs in the pan and I used a paper towel to wipe out whatever didn't land in the bowl. What was left- a clean pan needing no further wash!!Addition to Review on 11/13If you watched my video, you see that I used a metal spatula- which isn't the best idea with T-fal. If you want to keep the great results of the pots and pans, use the included plastic spatulas and spoons- While nonstick seems like magic, it needs to be treated well to keep working. I just wanted to add this- so people don't follow my bad example. My husband actually reminded me of this, after seeing the video and chiding me on my bad decision, so I don't ruin our new pots and pans (and my birthday present to myself).

I'll explain"", 'author': 'Kaniki', 'rating': 4, 'content': ""I bought the black 12 piece set. I have only cooked with them once so far and made eggs in one and cooked maple flavored sausage links in the other. Here is my impression of them. First, the final impression in short and to the point, then why I felt that way..The cliffnotes (short) version..Nice lids that fit on both, the pots and pans.. decent handles on the pots and pans, but not great.. easy to dent pots and pans.. very very cheap utensils.. Ok for single person, couple, or starter set.. Not great if you have kids (you know that they will get damaged 10 times faster with kids around) or if you like caramelizing things like meats to make gravies to stews.. OK for the price but not worth retail. Non stick works, but dont expect the slide around egg effect like you see on TV.. Made in china..Full, Description version of my review...The 3 utensil pieces (spoon, flipper, etc) do work, but I'll be honest, I have bought some in the past at the dollar tree, that were, yes you guessed it, a dollar, and they were made much better. The ones included do work but are not very strong, nor do I think that they will hold up to much use over time. But hey, you didnt buy this set for the utensils, you bought them for the pans, so what do you expect. they will work fine until you get to the store (or order off the net) to buy better ones.The lids to the set are pretty well made. they have plastic over the handles will keep you from burning your hands if you have to remove the lids and feel like it will hold up OK over time. there is a plastic, or silicone spacer between the handle rivets and the glass so that should help protect the glass from breaking due to the metal up against glass. Also, the lids fit perfectly on both, the fry pans and the pots, so you have a way to cover both without having to worry about splatter.. Just cant do both at the same time obviously.Now for the pots and pans.the handles feel decently made. Not great, but pretty good. On a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being great, i would give the handles a 6.. maybe 7 if i was feeling generous. They feel like they will hold up to normal use with no problem, but dont try to abuse them or you may have problems. and it may not be the handles fault, it may be the pot or pan part itself.The Nonstick coating works good from what I have seen so far. I cooked eggs in one, and did not need to use any butter to keep them from sticking. The eggs did not slide around like you will see them do on TV, but they did not stick either. They came right up with no problem and did not break the yolks either. The sausage links I cooked in the other pan never stuck either. I washed both out and dried them by hand and you could not see any kind of mark like they were ever used. so the coating did not peel at all, nor did cooking the food leave any marks.Now for the bad.. the aluminum that the pots and pans are made from is not extremely durable. When taking them out of the packing, one of the pots hit up against the flat pan, and guess what.. It dented.. Yes, that little hit was all it took. I have other good quality pots and pans with non stick coatings that are made out of aluminum too, and they can get hit 5 times harder and not dent.. The aluminum in these is a bit of a softer aluminum, so you have to watch or expect a lot of dents in your pans. But on the positive side of that, because of they way and type of aluminum that they are made out of, they are also light.. it is kinda like comparing whipped cream cheese to brick cream cheese.. one is much softer and lighter.. that is these.Another downfall, which I was not happy to find out, was that they were made in china. I did a search on amazon for american, or USA made pots and pans.. These were at the top of the list. Obviously I should have checked into it a little more and not trusted amazon to be accurate here, and for that reason, I did keep them, after all, they will work fine for what I want, but just to be clear.. China made, not American!!!One things that I never see that I would like to point out though, especially for first time buyers of non stick cookware. Non stick does have its advantages, like not having to use any kind of grease or oils when cooking, but at the same time, there is one major flaw to non stick coatings.. you can not brown food.. I have heard it as browning, glazing, caramelizing, etc. These cook the food fine, but you know how you take a roast and brown or caramelize a roast so that it gets that nice brown glaze in the bottom which is really good if you plan on making home made gravy, or for flavoring the stock in a roast so the flavor goes into the other foods when you cook a roast.., From what I have seen, any non stick pan i have ever used sucked at giving any kind of that browning or caramelizing. It cooks the food with not problem, but you dont get that bit that makes good flavoring or gravy material. If you plan on it, get a pan that is non stick for that purpose.. then after you do the initial caramelizing of the meat, then put all that in these pots if you want. but that is one major draw back to non stick coatings on cookware.Overall, they are not bad, but not great. They will work fine for a single person, or for a couple. For a decent first set, they are not bad either. If you are someone that gets their pans knocked around a bit (maybe put it in the sink then put stuff on top and clean everything later), then expect to get a lot of dents in these over time. Considering that you get these for under $10 per piece, they are not bad for the price, but i would say average priced for the set. I would not pay anywhere near the retail price for these because they are not worth that much, in my opinion at least. If they were more expensive, i probably would have given a 3 start instead of 4, but I tool price into consideration vs quality when I gave it 4 stars. In the end, it all depends on how you cook as to if these are good for you. Personally, I'll take my old club aluminum pots over these any day of the week.. but that is just my opinion. But also, luckily for me, these are for someone else, not for me, so i dont have to worry about it. :)........................................Update on info about them...according to the manual, they are good for gas, spiral or solid electric, ceramic (radiant) and halogen rangetops.also, the temp rating on them for the oven is.. 350f/175c with plastic handles or stainless steel handles with silicone inserts. 450f/230c for full silicone handles. 500f/260c for handles made completely out of aluminum or stainless steel. cookware with soft touch translucent portions is not oven safe. and never use them in the broiler."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 18, 2014', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars The Ultimate Cookware Set for Every Kitchen!', 'author': 'Atahan D.', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""The T-fal Signature Nonstick Cookware Set is a game-changer in the kitchen.

But was happy with the replacement.', 'author': 'Lyndon', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'The media could not be loaded. This is an update to my original review.After receiving my replacement pan I very carefully looked it over for any damage or flaws and did not see any, initially. However, I can find flaws on anything I look closely at. I did eventually find one, but this little blemish did not bother me like the gouge on the first one I received. There was a minor ""nick"" on the edge of the non-stick at the outer rim of the pan. (see added photos)Let\'s get the thing that I didn\'t like out of the way. The lid. I was cooking on a low heat and burned myself when taking the lid off. A different handle would be nice. One that doesn\'t carry the heat like this one does. Also, there is a pocket between the glass and the rim that will hold liquid. It is a real pain to try and get it clean and dry.Okay, now for the good stuff that I did like. In my testing I tried both an induction cook top as well as a gas stove for my experimenting. I tested for heat distribution, discoloration, slipperiness, flatness and over-all cooking performance. First I just wanted to break in the pan to heat and check how well it boils water on the induction. The boil was rather quick. About 4 minutes from tap water to begin boil at a 320 deg cook top setting. The boil was pretty even and extending to the outer parts of the pan surface pretty well for a medium priced pan. No discoloration that I could see. Of course I wasn\'t applying a tremendous amount of heat.I rinsed the pan out and wiped it dry. Clean and dry within a few wipes and seconds. Nice. Then I made some taco meat. See the video I added showing a low flame and spread out heat dispersion. I Like it. The pan performed well without any meat sticking or burning. Sliding stuff out of the pan into a container is a challenge. Everything slides to the edge and wants to all come out at the same time. So I needed to get a very wide container and it still wanted to dump all over the counter. I think the sides might be a bit steep in my opinion. After that I rinsed and dried and again, zip-zip, clean and ready for some Chorizo y Juevos. The meat cooked great, just as the ground beef did. Nice and low, even heat. Then I transferred it to a standby skillet so I could wipe the inside and do 8 scrambled eggs. No surprise at this point that the eggs scrambled up nicely for such a large quantity at once.I mixed in the chorizo and then into a container. Yep, again, food dumped on the counter because I did not have much control pouring it out of the pan.I then dunked the mostly cooled pan in a sink of dishwater, wiped it out with a sponge, short rinse and quick dry. All in all a good cooking experience. The pan is a keeper for me as long as it doesn\'t fail later by losing its surface or having the bottom warp. The base of the pan did discolor slightly from the gas stove but I had expected that and I did get a little scratching from the stove grates, but that\'s expected too.If you are willing to expect a pan be delivered with some blemishes or even not just ""perfect"", then I would say this pan works well otherwise. Blemishes, lid and pouring lose a star. Other than that I am so far happy with it.Original review...What I expected was a really nice pan in a quality and new condition. I was excited in waiting for it but I was quickly disappointed by what I saw when I took it out of the box.Take a look at the photos I included. There was a very noticeable blemish on the base that I saw almost immediately. When looking closer I saw that it was a gouge of sorts. If you look closely at the zoomed photo you can also see a bunch of other scratches around the gouge as if it were mishandled prior to packaging. There was absolutely no damage to the box it was packaged in. So the only other way it could be this way is if it was produced this way.I cannot even try it and give an honest impression of what it is like to cook in it. I felt the gouge and it is quite apparent that it is going to scratch the cook top surface I would be placing it on. The base is also rather rough feeling aside from this gouge. I expected it to be smooth as satin to the touch from the description in the ad.If the pan is already damaged before I can even have a chance to try it, then what is the point of even moving forward to see what the performance of this skillet is?I\'ll spend the week to try and contact the manufacturer about this issue and see what they say before boxing it back up and returning it. Not sure if I want to exchange it. The quality issues could be an ongoing thing with this brand. Hopefully they are responsive to my contact attempt.I\'m really sorry I had to review it this way. I was really hoping to love this frying pan.

And I will say - this Caraway fry pan - well there’s something just not right about it. Something that just doesn’t add up. After a single use, food began adhering to the pan’s cooking surface. Not just eggs, mind you; which is probably the main thing most of us hope to use our nonstick cookware for. Everything sticks. Bacon sticks. Sausage sticks. Potatoes stick. Meats, veggies - shoot, a slice of bread sticks to this pan. Would you like to simply to warm something from the fridge, reheat leftovers? Nope. It will stick. If you can cook something in this pan, it will stick to this pan. And not just a little bit of stick. No, no, no, my friends. Look to some of the other very low reviews. See the video evidence. There’s a whole lot of stick. A tear your food up trying to get it out of the pan and on to the plate kind of stick. And then a soak in hot water and scrape stuff out kind of stick. And then a do it again to get what you couldn’t get out after all that kind of stick. Following the recommended cleaning method of a bringing a cup of water with two tbls of baking soda to boil for several minutes and then rinsing…stuff sticks. No amount of cleaning, nor method of cleaning seems to affect the performance. Neither does cooking technique. Cook on low, stuff sticks. Cook on medium, stuff sticks. Cook with oil, sticks. No oil, sticks. Truly preposterous. This said, however, this is not merely a poor non stick pan; it is a poor pan. The handle, though ergonomically sound and comfortable to grip, transfers heat far too readily. On a gas range, it quickly becomes ‘too hot to handle.’ Beyond the five minute mark, even on low heat, you will be burned by the handle. Additionally, the pan’s exterior surface cannot be kept clean, which for a daily use pan isn’t critical in my book, excepting that the finish seems designed to have stuff actually adhere to it. Again, not especially off putting for me as I believe in function over aesthetics, but I find it strange this should be so. That said, my expectations for this pan were fairly straight forward. I hoped for a decently made nonstick pan that would heat mostly evenly, that would be mostly nonstick, that would function in my working kitchen alongside some other quality cookware that consists exclusively of copper clad stainless steel and cast iron. I looked very forward to a more healthful alternative to the everyday nonstick more typically relied upon. And I hoped to get perhaps as much as a year’s use of the pan before having to replace it. I take care of my cookware. I always use soft implements, never metal, and always rely upon gentle cleaning methods - soft sponges and plastic scrappers only if necessary. Given the performance of this pan, at this point, however, I am disappointed across the board. I also must and do question any and all claims made as to this cookware’s efficacy. As well as the efficacy of any claims or reviews that would laud its performance as commendable. I am, in short, severely skeptical. I know my way around a kitchen, and as far as I’m concerned, I will not deign to so much as boil water in it at this point. It has no redeeming qualities given its performance. And given its performance, I cannot help but to doubt its other claims as to being a healthier alternative to other cookware options. Given the $100 price tag for the pan, one must conclude that such a high relative cost is primarily for covering marketing and profit. And I would challenge anyone willing to make contrary claims as to this pan’s performance to prove such claims as anything better than specious. From my experience, this appears to be a clear matter of consumer grift. Given what my experience with this product has been, there is simply no other reasonable explanation. Out of the box, it does look nice; it does feel nice. First cook: it works nice. And then the honeymoon is over. And the fight is on.

For example, when I got up this past Saturday, I said to myself, ""gee, I wonder what it would be like to make the world\'s best pancakes?"" and then I cooked pancakes on this cast iron skillet, and said to myself, ""this REALLY IS the world\'s best pancakes. Does not get better than that!""Cooking everything I\'ve ever cooked before has literally become a whole new experience.I\'ve also had a number of times in my life where I bought things thinking if I bought it, I\'d do more of something I wanted to do. For example, I\'ve bought instruments wanting to play instruments, or bought games wanting to play some games with friends. In almost all cases, I buy that thing and proceed to not do anything with it beyond using it a couple times.Not with this. I\'m discovering more and more that when you have the right tools to make delicious things, cooking is so much more fun than I ever thought it would be.I *look forward* to cooking.And, hell, even cleaning -- because while cast iron is a lot less scary to take care of than some people think, it does require work. And I kind of feel like with my new skillet, it\'s kind of like a new pet. And one that I love. But like a new pet, it sometimes needs attention that can\'t be too delayed.Previously, I\'d have left a dirty pan in the sink for hours... maybe days. Now, I clean it up right after I eat, because it\'s my new \'puppy\' and it needs its cleaning now.There\'s been a weirdly fulfilling ritual to this, though, that\'s connected me to my kitchen -- plus, I enjoy this new cleaner kitchen I\'ve been keeping almost as much as I\'ve been enjoying the food that I\'ve eaten!To think a fairly small purchase has changed so much about me in such a short time -- and made me appreciate so many new and different things -- is, well, damn. I love it.A few little caveats:This ended up being a bit bigger than I expected, but that\'s my fault for not comparing the measurements to my existing pans and skillets. I thought this was a \'standard\' sized pan (whatever \'standard\' is), and it ended up being a good deal bigger than the biggest pan I had before.That said, I actually *really* like the size. This makes cooking a lot of things that was challenging a lot easier -- I made a *giant* thing of made-from-scratch Mac and Cheese (enough for 12 people!), and this actually managed to fit the entire thing. (And the fact that I could use one pan for the stove top *and* the oven was nice.).I also enjoy how much easier to is to flip things, and how there\'s extra space if I want to cook a couple different at the same time. Another nice thing: if you\'re cooking burgers or hot dogs, you can cook the meat in the center of the pan and have *plenty* of space around the sides to heat the buns, and this makes them extra tasty.It is a bit heavy, however. I\'m able to handle it with one hand (though that took a little getting used to), but a member of my household in her mid to late 60s isn\'t. Still, she\'s able to handle it much easier than she thought the first time she picked it up because of it\'s second handle. Consider this the Great Sword of the kitchen -- a number of people are going to need to use its two handles to use with ease.The last caveat: If you\'ve never used cast iron -- like I\'ve never used cast iron -- *wow* do they get hot, and they *retain* their heat. I took the advice of all the blog articles I\'ve read and seasoned it a few extra times before my first use, and the first time I took it out of the oven I burned myself -- right through my oven mitt. If you pick this skillet in the oven at very high temperatures, make sure to use both the silicone hot handle holder and a *good* pair of oven mitts.My burn was very minor because I had the oven mitts on, but they were crappy, cheap oven mitts. I immediately threw them out and bought a good pair of oven mitts on that were designed to be able to protect at 450.I haven\'t burned myself since, but it\'s definitely something to be careful about.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States June 20, 2017', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': ""3.0 out of 5 stars Here's what's really going on with this pan"", 'author': 'Joe Vasicek', 'rating': 3, 'content': ""There are a lot of confusing reviews on this product, with some people claiming that it's not actually cast iron and posting pictures to show it. Here's what's actually going on.The pan is made of cast iron. I've been cooking with cast iron for a decade now, and have various pans, including one handed down from my father that sadly developed a crack in it, which is why we bought this one (also growing family, etc). I'm not an expert in metallurgy, but I've got a decent idea of what goes on in the manufacturing of these things. Melt pig iron, pour it into a mold, let it cool and set, then season for everyday use.This is a cheap Chinese-made pan. Typical of most Chinese-made products, the manufacturer cut a lot of corners. The sides and bottom are slightly thinner than comparable American-made cast iron pans. I'm guessing that the iron itself is of lower quality, and that it was not mixed or cooled properly when cast. As a result of these shortcuts, the bottoms of these pans tend to be slightly convex, with the center being higher than the sides. Hence the reviews complaining about oil not staying in the center.In typical Chinese fashion, the manufacturer fixed this problem in the quickest and easiest way: by machining the center of the pan. However, this machined surface lacks the porous texture that makes cast iron so awesome. The pores expand with heat and contract when the pan cools, trapping lipid chains from fats and oils which gives the pan its sheen and patina. However, with a smooth machined surface, this pan never fully develops those non-stick properties, and the patina comes off easily with a heavy cleaning, giving it the silvery metallic appearance that has convinced so many one-star reviewers that this pan is not cast iron.TL;DR: If you're looking for something cheap and cast-iron that you can toss in the back of your truck or camper, forget about for a couple of years, then pull out, scrape the rust off, and cook over a campfire or somesuch, this is a decent pan. If you're looking for a pan you can use every day and hand down to your children as a cherished family heirloom, spend the extra money and buy American made."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 24, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Nice pan', 'author': 'Private User', 'rating': 4, 'content': ""Nice pan was preseasoned only thing I didn't like about it you had to put the knob on the lid which it should have been on there in the first place no instructions on how to do it they give you a bunch of pieces and you got to figure it out yourself that's the only drawback"", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 29, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars THIS IS A GREAT, CLASSIC FRY PAN, DURABLE AND WILL LAST A LIFETIME', 'author': 'LaTigresse999', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'This made a great gift for my sister, who needed a new frying pan.

My previus favorite was a TFal with the red temp ball in the middle worked great but the non-stick was not as smooth as this pan. Both were induction capable. The biggest issue for me is that the TFal had a taipered design and that made the cooking surface a lot small (wider at the top than the bottom). Probably the biggest complaint with the TFal was that the pans cook surface has a convex shape so when you drop in an egg, it would end up in the edge of the pan.

They raved on and on about it so I felt I needed one too! I put it on my wishlist and received it as a gift from my family. It is so easy to love this pan!Since the reviews do not contain photos of cooked food in the pan (when I wrote this review) I thought I'd add a little color! The first photo is the first flip of the sausage. This was cooked on my electric stove that is so not very level. As you can see on the lighter first flip photo, the cooking is perfectly even on all of the sausage patties. The second photo is at the second and final flip, completely cooked, absolutely evenly browned. This was cooked on Medium-High. Excellent nonstick surface as claimed. Game Changer for sure!On my electric stovetop it took as long to heat up as my iron skillet does, I'm sure induction will be much faster. It has a heavy thickness on the bottom (stainless steel) that I believe will not warp. Though I haven't used it on my induction plate, I feel it will work so well too in fact, on all cooking surfaces as claimed. I've never seen an induction plate cook so evenly on my glass top! My other induction pans are awful on my electric glass cooktop. This one performs!!It has a thick granite nonstick surface and there was absolutely perfect application of this surface at the factory. It works so well. Eggs slide around in the pan easily too! Hello sunny side up!Cleaning is so easy, pour out any liquids or fats, use a sponge with a little soap and water, rinse and you are done. I don't plan on putting mine in the dishwasher because it is so easy to hand wash, however, you could do that easily. Even if the dishwasher is full, you can remove the handle for better positioning in the dishwasher if you like. Also the handle can be removed for storage space. The handle has a button release mechanism which is not hard to push. What a beautiful feature and designed well with the cook and space in mind! The handle attaches firmly and does not wobble or move. It is not slick in the hand and has a slight grip with the bakelite finish. It is very safe.There is an added pour spout which I appreciate and will use often for grease and other hot liquids to prevent spills.The 3 inch walls help with grease splatter and also allow this skillet to hold 4.3 Quarts! This is a perfect size for any food recipe or even cooking application like boiling, frying or sauteeing large amounts of veggies!The lid has a vent hole and is made of tempered explosion-proof glass, which has good thermal stability. The pour spout also has a small vented area. The handle of the lid has a pretty asthetic and also made of the same material as the handle, cool to touch. It is large enough to fit perfectly in the palm of the hand. The lid fits tight (but still turns) on the skillet.It is recommended to use silicone, nylon or wooden utensils so the life of the pan is extended. I also do not recommend to cook at high temperatures for the same reason. The recommended high temp is 302F. The surface is PFOA-Free.The outside walls of the pan are an interesting pattern placed on top of the granite surface. It almost seems like an aligator type print. It is not really a strong pattern.I love the pan, I may buy another just in case!!"", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 7, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great product', 'author': 'brent', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'It’s a wonderful pan and cooking with it is great.

I’ve had a chance to try this out for a few batches of scrambled eggs and just tried an omelet this morning. I like a nice plump-with-fillings sort of omelet and this pan was a pinch too small for that. There wasn’t enough bottom of the pan width for the eggs to spread out enough to provide coverage for the amount of veggies I like. So that’s the 1 star deduction. “Make a less stuffed omelet!” cries the peanut gallery. Surely a possibility, but I’m not a fan of omelets where the innards seem like an afterthought rather than part of a balanced, harmonious breakfast meal. Plenty slick, nonstick-wise. I do use a bit of oil and butter to assist with flavor and slipperiness. I’ve had enough of the soaking and scraping with my stainless pans, and don’t want to be disappointed with this pan so I’ll work up to an oil-less attempt at scrambled eggs later. Not sure what technology some of the nonstick offerings on the market are to justify their $50 to $150 price tags. This one seems much more fairly priced. The handle is advertised as Bakelite, but it has a really nice satiny feel to it and is very comfortable in the hand, making flipping veggies easy when sautéing. Hopefully the seller/manufacturer will offer additional sizes for those folks who want a bit more real estate to work with when crafting omelets. It is deep enough to do some stovetop frying, and would handle smaller portions of French fries. Could probably fit a couple servings of tots, chicken tenders or fish sticks too.

Get yourself a good, heavy aluminum, stainless steel, or cast iron skillet if you want a scorching hot sear, or want to make pan sauces, or skillet fry something.It might be worth doing a comparison between this pan (the Ultimate Hard Anodized) and the popular Professional Total Nonstick T-fal E93808 Professional Total Nonstick Thermo-Spot Heat Indicator Fry Pan, 12.5 Inch, Black , since I\'ve owned both, now, and some might be considering one or the other.I originally bought the Professional based on the Cooks Illustrated recommendation (as many others have), and it\'s a great pan. So great that my wife simply couldn\'t resist using it as an every-day pan, so it\'s lifespan was shortened. One feature of the Pro pan is that it\'s stainless steel clad on the bottom, so it will work with induction stove tops. It\'s not a thick cladding, though. While the company touts this as ""anti-warp protection,"" I found that this construction actually makes it MORE prone to warping. First, unlike more expensive 2-ply or multi-ply pans, this one just features a fairly thin stainless steel ""disk"" mated to a fairly thin aluminum body. The different metals expand and contract at different rates under the same conditions. Since the aluminum is not sandwiched between stainless steel, the pan is more likely to warp. And that\'s what happened – just enough that it did not sit flat on our ceramic cooktop anymore. It\'s probably not as much of a problem with a gas burner or a coiled electric top, though, as it conducts heat fairly evenly and easily.So when it came time to replace this pan after the non-stick surface wore out, I decided to go with this hard anodized aluminum version. It was a good decision. since it is made with one, very heat-conductive metal, and is a little more heavy duty (although just as light as the Pro version since it\'s all aluminum). It\'s still straight and flat, even though it\'s gotten overheated a couple of times (we have one runaway burner that we have to keep an eye on, sometimes!)Not that the construction is slightly different. Both skillets have the same non-stick surface and the same oven-safe handle, but the shape is a little different. This one is a 12"" skillet and the Pro is 12.5"". However, I found that this measurement is based on the lip of the skillet, and the Pro version is more flared-out on the sides, where this skillet has more straight, up-and-down sides. In fact, despite a smaller diameter at the lip, I\'ve found the Anodized skillet has slightly more cooking surface than the Pro version. While the flared sides might be a little more omelette-friendly, I haven\'t had any problems sliding anything out of the pan. In fact, if you are stir-frying anything, I have found that the straighter sides are better for holding things inside the skillet.All in all, I would recommend this anodized aluminum pan over the Pro version – unless you have an induction cooktop. Then the Pro version is your only choice.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 24, 2017', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars T-Fal is quality', 'author': 'Stacy Zellner', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I bought this as a replacement for an hold pan I had for awhile.

This particular model had the lowest percentage of 1 Star reviews out of dozens of brands and models that I researched on Amazon. I noted that many of the bad reviews mentioned the fact that the pan was not flat in the middle (being convex, or higher in the center). I also noted that the manufacturer made comments within those reviews that the pan can warp upwards, in the center, if it is subjected to ""too high"" heat, without anything in it, and/or running cold water into an already very hot pan, which can cause it to warp. With that warning heeded in the 1 Star reviews, when I received the pan from Amazon, the first thing I did when I took it out of the box, was to pour some cold oil into the new unused, cold pan, never heated yet on the stove. Needless to say, I was very disappointed in what I saw (picture attached). If TFal can\'t manufacture a flat bottom pan, off the assembly line then they ought not to sell their pans, while claiming that they are flat in the center.TFal has multiple iterations of their non stick pans, and I purposely bought this one, after inspecting various models in retail stores and noting that this model had the thickest metal, compared to other TFal models. Thus I assumed that the thicker metal would insure a flatter bottom. But, sadly TFal is producing this model with a built in hump in the middle that forces product to the edges. Or they produce some that come out flat and some that do not.....roll the dice and hope you get a flat one.I am a former ""upscale restaurant"" owner with 20 years of extensive cooking under my belt, as well as being an extremely accomplished cook at home, and most of my kitchen cooking gear is very expensive restaurant grade stainless steel clad, with aluminum cores and very thick bottoms. My ""home use"" professional restaurant skillets cost $200- $300 for a 12"" or larger, and that is what I always cook on, at home, due to their performance and being able to develop ""fond"" for deglazing, extremely even cooking, heat retention, etc. Thirty years ago, as a young adult, I fell for the ""Teflon"" rage and had a full set of Teflon cookware and after just a couple years of use, the coating simply wore off, in spite of always using plastic spatulas and wooden or plastic spoons. After that, I swore never to buy non stick again. But technology changed dramatically with all of the new surface materials, although I still resisted trusting any of it.But I recently decided that I needed a durable non stick skillet for some very specific dishes and had hopes that this one would perform as expected and more in line with the huge number of 5 Star reviews. I figured what the heck. It wasn\'t as if I were spending over a hundred bucks for a pan, so the risk/reward factor compelled me to give it a try, after some research. With this higher grade TFal model, If it were not for the convex center which causes ghee, oils, and liquid contents to migrate to the outside perimeter (causing uneven cooking results), I would give the pan high marks for its non stick properties and easy clean up. And the heat spread within the pan seems to be pretty even and consistent, as long as you have it centered over the heat source (I use a gas range), and you maintain the heat source at a level that does not shoot out beyond the edges of the pan (especially with gas, which will toast anything near the sidewalls, while delivering less cooking heat near the center....common sense.Be cautioned though that the surface can be pretty easily scratched with anything that is not plastic. I had used some metal restaurant tongs to gently grab the raised edge of some bacon strips to turn them, while trying not to even touch the non stick surface. When I went to wipe out the pan with a soft sponge after it had cooled down, I noticed an inch long barely noticeable scuff on the surface. It was not enough to in any way alter the integrity of the not stick surface and will probably not result in any negative impact down the road, but I did notice that a very slight scuff occurred. Going forward, nothing will ever touch the surface of this pan, except for rubber coated whisks, rubber coated tongs, etc.Although I am hopeful, that Tfal might be able to replace this defective pan with one that comes from the factory absolutely flat in the center. But that might be an unrealistic expectation because, in order to accomplish that and prior to shipping, TFal would have to do a water test inside of a replacement pan to see if the water migrates to the outer edges of the pan....and if it doesn\'t, send me a flat replacement, because I do like the pan for its performance, if it were absolutely flat, like my professional grade skillets.****************Revised Update********************One week after I received this pan, I called TFal\'s customer service. Of course they were cordial and listened to what I just described above, testing the pan, out of the box, without any heat applied, which proves that the pan came from the factory that way. They said I would have to pay for shipping to send the pan in for evaluation. The cost of shipping is close to the value of the pan itself and there is no reimbursement if TFal agrees that it is a manufacturing defect, of no flat bottom. They will replace the pan and send me a new one. There is no way that I am going to incur extra cost for this pan, and TFal could easily come back and claim that excessive heat probably warped the pan, or that cold water was poured into a very hot pan. I don\'t see how any kind of visual assessment from TFal is going to make a difference in determining whether my claim is correct or whether they want to assert misuse. So their warranty isn\'t worth a hoot, since you will incur unwarranted cost to return the pan, unlike Amazon\'s policy of issuing a prepaid shipping label to return defective products. So, I will return the pan at no cost, for a refund, from Amazon. You are rolling the dice on whether you will get a flat bottom, when you order this pan, so, just know that there is no recourse that makes sense, from TFal, regarding their warranty.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States August 21, 2018', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars good quality', 'author': 'THERESA ACKROYD', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Nice pans', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 19, 2024', 'is_verified': True}]"

I’d been wanted to ditch my non-stick cookware for several years for health reasons but couldn’t find the right fit. I’m spoiled by growing up cooking with only non-stick cookware. And I’m NOT a good cook so I tend to overheat pans & burn food. AND I sooo dislike cleaning up after cooking that I’d prefer to do it later (like the next day). I’m possibly the worst case scenario for testing any cookware line. I’d honestly much rather enjoy being served nice meals in restaurants. But, I’m immunocompromised so COVID changed all that. So, I’ve needed to up my game & learn to cook decently.I first tested several brands of stainless steel cookware. It was a total nightmare for me to clean. I then tried out ceramic cookware but found it to be too heavy for my arthritic joints. After reading about and researching Hestan’s Nanobond’s titanium coating, I thought it sounded promising & ordered this pan. Besides, the design of all of Hestan’s cookware is simply gorgeous.This Hestan Nanobond pan turned out to be AMAZING. My 1st test was fried eggs that turned out perfect with no sticking and easy cleanup afterwards. I’d read to heat the pan first, then add the oil/butter next & let it heat, and to then add the eggs. That definitely works to make the surface as close to being non-stick without actually having a non-stick coating. I’ve used it repeatedly for sticky foods like fried eggs, scrambled eggs, grilled cheese sandwiches, etc. with thrilling results. Best of all, it’s easy to clean afterwards.The Hestan Nanobond cookware is fantastic & suits my needs perfectly. I’ve now bought many more of the pots and pans in all shapes & sizes. I’m thrilled with the good looks & performance of the Nanobond line, the ease of cleaning up afterwards, and the titanium coating’s overall forgivingness for bad cooks. I accidentally added ground sausage needing to be browned for a casserole directly to their still-warming 3.5 quart sauté pan. The sausage stuck immediately to the bottom & I knew I’d really screwed up. While stirring the rest of the meat with only a silicon spatula, however, the stuck remnants surprisingly released completely from the bottom! I then decided to go ahead & try baking the entire casserole in the covered Nanobond pan in the oven instead of dirtying up a casserole dish. The casserole turned out fantastic with perfectly browned sides & bottom. The servings easily released from the pan without falling apart. And the very baked-on food remnants STILL cleaned up easily. The beautiful design of Hestan’s cookware really makes it equally appealing for stove/oven to table presentation.

I am hesitant to buy the larger skillets if they are going to be super thin like the 8 inch is.BOTTOM LINE:I think I’m going to love this pan for scrambled eggs, and I don’t know what else.. I plan to try a reverse sear with salmon or a hamburger.. I usually slow cook vegetables in an enameled cast iron sauce pan, so I don’t have to worry about salt and other seasonings leaching the SS.. But I suppose I will try some vegetables in the nano bond titanium (as a little browning is supposed to add a layer of flavor.. but I suspect browning anything is less healthy).STICK, OR NOT TO STICK?Mystery solved.. I was perplexed by so many reviews complaining about things sticking to the titanium nanobond, because my scrambled eggs were sliding around, almost like a nonstick pan. I just watched a video comparison of three different stainless steel pans.. The Heston nanobond, and demeyere (both of which I have cooked scrambled eggs on).. In the video they got the pans hot until the water drops danced around, which I think of it as a trick that allows you to cook scrambled eggs in cast-iron.. Plus they used what looked like some kind of vegetable oil.. And the egg was stuck in the pan bad.. I use butter at a low temperature (which I believe is appropriate for eggs), and the eggs don’t stick at all..LEACHING INTO FOODI’ve always heard that titanium is extremely non-reactive, but I have been UNABLE to find any information (other than manufacturers claims) whether titanium cookware will leach anything into food while cooking (ie: acidic foods, like tomato paste, or how it’s well known that salt will pit stainless steel).. Titanium is supposed to be completely safe for humans, so we can only hope if anything leeches it would be pure titanium (manufacturers tend to be untrustworthy, I can only hope in Italy they have tighter regulations for such things than in America).. If you search the Internet you can find where testing was done with SS pans.. Some manufacturers claim you can cook tomato red sauce in them (even though tomatoes do leech from SS)..SUPER THIN?When I say super thin, perhaps I’m spoiled by using expensive aluminum clad cookware from other brands that have a hefty amount of aluminum.. Because of the high price of Heston nano bond cookware, they should pop for thick enough aluminum layer to where we should have to wonder if it’s enough.. And to be clear I don’t know how thick the aluminum layer needs to be to do. It’s job..The thin-ness of the pan makes me wonder if it would be prone to warping (with my other stainless steel pans, I clean them while they are hot, but I am fearful to put water into these thin nano bond skillets).. NOTE: I don’t put a lot of cold water into a hot pan, rather a little bit that steam cleans most of the pan (none of my pans have ever warped).HEAT MOMENTUM:The other problem with extra thin aluminum cladding is heat momentum.. Heat momentum is one of the reasons cast-iron pans work so well for certain things (such as putting a frozen hamburger patty, and getting heat momentum to create the seer.. instead of the frozen patty immediately cooling off the pan which destroys the seer). In my particular case, using the control freak induction burner that has a built-in temperature probe, it will probably compensate by instantly turning the power up (which I hear it doing when I take a little off, to try to maintain temperature).. I doubt the thin aluminum will work in this instance, if you’re trying to cook a frozen steak or anything substantial without cool in the pan off..NON-STICK:I have not used nonstick pans for decades, but I have been cooking scrambled eggs in aluminum clad stainless steel pans for years.. And for the past year. I’ve been using Demeyere SS skillets, which have a treated SS surface that concentrates the chromium and nickel and removes the iron (it makes the stainless steel, more stainless steel, and it does stick less than regular SS, but not by much)..[Again contrary to what many reviews are saying], when I cooked scrambled eggs in the Heston nanobond it felt like nonstick to me. There was an obvious non-stick quality even compared to my demeyere). Like my demeyere pans, I expect I will have to occasionally use the special cleaner, or barkeepers friend, to get rid of the haze/seasoning that develops (this is expected)..Likewise cleanup was very easy (like I would imagine non-stick would be).TOO—LIGHT—WEIGHT?I know other reviews think it’s thick/heavy, but it is by far the lightest pan I have ever held in my hands (and I’ve used a few different brands of aluminum clad stainless steel pans).. I realize titanium is light weight, but the nano bond is a very thin layer of titanium (presumably over stainless steel)..The pan is so light weight that it’s causing the problem with my control, freak induction burner.. The 8” or will sit flat by itself, but because it’s so light weight, and the handle is relatively heavy, it will not sit flat on the induction burner for preheating, because there is a temperature probe in the center (that has a lightweight spring)..And (when cooking anything sensitive to uneven heat) you very much need to preheat pans on an induction burner, because the nature of induction heats the pan itself so there is always a hot ring in the center of the pan that matches the induction ring (preheating for a while lets the heat spread out)..BOTTOM LINE: I was able to preheat the pan to cook my scrambled eggs, but one end of the pan was about 1/8” off the induction burner (and induction burners are sensitive to this.I WOULD HATE: to try to preheat the 8” pan for a seer on this induction burner (the 1/8” in the air might end up a huge problem at high power settings)..COOKING TECHNIQUES:There is technique to consider in whether eggs or anything sticks or not..For scrambled eggs I use low heat (228F.. since my induction burner controls the temperature).. and I use plenty of butter (I am convinced, low carb is healthy, and butter and egg yolks are healthy fats).. my eggs were sliding around the pan like the nonstick advertisements..CLEANUP:My experience with cleanup was like you would imagine nonstick. But I’ve seen many reviews complain about food sticking to the pan (I can only assume they were using high heat, and maybe little or no oil).. I can’t say for sure, but I know with my other stainless steel pans anytime something sticks, I just put a squeeze of dish soap and a little water and come back in an hour (or the next morning).. If I’m in a hurry, I’ll turn on the burner for a few seconds so warm soap will work faster.. Then whatever was stuck on usually falls off.. Sometimes I use vinegar (I don’t know whether dish soap vinegar would be more effective)..', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 20, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Very high quality in ALMOST every area.', 'author': 'Teddy', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'Pros: the finish looks beautiful as it’s slightly a smoky grey color which is very smooth and though not nonstick is less sticky than other stainless steel pans I’ve used. Good weight, feels sturdy and i love the flush rivets. Heats up quick and the high heat resistance is great so it works I’m pretty much any cooking environment other than a microwave.Cons. Mostly small nitpicks but for an expensive pan small can be big depending on your taste. Pricey. On my induction top at least the pan bottom warps very slightly so as thin coat of oil tends to pool towards the outer edges of the pan, this pretty common in a lot of pans but i do wish at this price it could be avoided. The handle feels high quality but could be slightly more comfortable if the part that rests against your palm was just a bit wider.Overall: If you can deal with those nitpicks this will make a great pan for small tasks like a grilled cheese or an omelet etc. and last a long time. happy cooking!', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 31, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent for searing', 'author': 'L.

During that time it has gotten regular use--about 3-4 times a week. And we do use a high heat (which I have read can shorten the non-stick life of a pan) for burgers and bacon. For the first 2 1/2 years, the non-stick surface worked great. At about 2 1/2 years, things started sticking (particularly noticeable for scrambled eggs). There was no sign of scratching/flaking/peeling of the non-stick surface, but the things just weren\'t sliding around so easily. We\'ve toughed it out since then--it\'s still useable, but the non-stick property has steadily declined. We will probably get a replacement soon--the annoyance factor has about caught up with the combined ""don\'t want to be bothered"" and ""don\'t want to pay for another pan"" factors.It\'s tough to figure out how long to expect a non-stick pan to last. The manufacturers will say things like ""Years of durability"" but from what I\'ve read reject warranty claims because the say they were improperly cared for. I\'ve seen many complaints about ceramic coatings--the latest in non-stick approaches--losing their non-stick properties within months of use. In my experience, I\'m pretty surprised if a pan is still useful after 3 years of regular use and this pan came reasonably close to that mark.Other criteria:Size: this was a big selling point for me. There are very few pans big enough to make 4 burgers, let alone 4 pieces of french toast. This pan will easily accommodate 4 large burgers, and will even take 4 pieces of french toast, if you don\'t mind the corners turning up a bit if using larger (bigger than wonder bread) pieces of bread.Even heat: The outer edges of the pan do not seem to get quite as hot as the inner part of the pan. This is noticeable if you are browning meat. You may want to turn things if you want them to be cooked perfectly evenly.Non-stick (while it lasted): Before it started to degrade, the non-stick surface worked great. No oil needed for eggs, bacon, burgers, pancakes, or anything else.

It stains very easily. I tested it by frying some ground lamb on medium heat. The picture attached shows the pan after I scrubbed it with a course metal pan scrubber. The stains would not come off. By contrast, another pan that I've had for over 20 years and use quite often scrubs much cleaner. I also noticed that the color of the stainless is not as bright as my old one.

MADE IN GERMANY', 'author': 'Michael Y.', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Well, I have yet to find a really durable non-stick pan, these pans all have sprayed on coatings and on every one ive ever seen the coating eventually fails - its just a question of when. The infomercials make wild claims that dont even match the pans own instructions of use, how they get away with this is baffling. They often iimpress at first use and get glowing reviews, then at some point its in the trash - to be fair this is often as much to do with improper use of metal utensils on a non stick surface as anything, but ive had pans I treated with kid gloves and still the coating failed. OK call me negative but its the truth 99.5% of the time and its something only time will tell. So, that aside I will say this pan makes a great first impression - the nice looking if not unusual coating and pan construction seem to indicate better than average quality and durability based on ther pans feel and weight as well as thickness. I especially like the very well made handle that will never burn me and looks very much like real wood but is really a man made high heat synthetic, and thats fine as long as it holds up, but the handle is one of the best ive seen far as comfort and safety go -- the down side is you can not put this pan in the oven with this type handle, and im not faulting the pan for this because the manufacturer tells you this in the instructions and I knew this going in so if you want such a pan buy one made to go in the oven. - Ive only used the pan three times so far and can not deny I am impressed, I lightly cleaned and wiped the pan dry, then fried eggs sunny side up and there was no sticking they slid out with almost no coaxing. Then with no cleaning I fried some breakfast sausage and the pan proved easy to work with and cooked the sausage nice and evenly, no sticking and the sausage came out great. Finally, leaving all the sausage remnants in the pan untouched I fried two more eggs sunny side up, and again there was no sticking the eggs slid right out with no issues - again its still early in the game but I found this very encouraging, often frying an egg after sausage makes it hard to retrieve the egg - but not in this case, in fact though I am a nonstick skeptic I already love this pan -- but I know in my heart only time will show how good a companion this pan proves to be. I would say if this pan could deliver say, five to seven years of this kind of performance its a bargain for $30, almost nothing today is built to last like things used to so the five to seven year rule is just my opinion and in todays world not many things last five to seven years, so I figure that would be a very good lifespan for a $30 non stick pan, and hopefully being made in Germany will mean something as far as build quality making it a realistic projection - but so far I have nothing bad at all to say about the pans performance or overall build quality, given what I know so far of it the $30 price seems well in line and for now I have to say its a solid performer and definitely one to try if youre looking, its not a run of the mill TV ad clone and its one of the reasons I pulled the trigger. Ive only seen the one size so far, hopefully there will be and 8 and 12 inch available, because if it proves itself good I definitely want another one or two of these pans.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 20, 2019', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Beautiful pots.', 'author': 'Deborah Finch', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Durability and charm.

I bought the pan to test the technology. This was the cheapest pan that had the hybrid technology. I think it was a good buy. When the pan came, I washed it and decided to cook an egg. I put the pan on med heat and put some olive in the pan. Like the manufacturer claims, the oil stuck and spread itself evenly. I put the egg in and it cooked evenly. I think I had the heat up a little too high, but will test it as I use it more. Maybe Med-Low next time. The egg cooked evenly and didn\'t stick as advertised. I used my silicone spatula so I haven\'t yet tested the claim that you can safely use metal utensils. The egg slid right out of the pan and clean up was super easy. The only concern I have is the rim of the pan is turning brown... After just one use...! We\'ll see how it holds up. Also the pan is a very lightweight and I am a little concerned about how even it distributes heat. But I will admit, the egg did cook evenly so I\'ll need to test it a little more to get a feel for how well heat is distributed. The diamond pattern is attractive to look at and the 6"" pan is barely big enough to cook an egg or hold a slice of bread. The egg did taste great though.

When I became old enough to want to learn how to cook, she taught me many secrets to her success in the kitchen. One of those ""Secrets"" was a simple piece of advice... Clean your stainless steel pots and pans with with a steel wool scouring pad (insert your favorite brand name here) before you cook in them and always clean them that way. There is something in the way that the steel wool and soap interacts with the surface of your pan that make it much less likely to stick while cooking, so there my mom\'s tip to you folks complaining that these pans stick! I followed mom\'s advice (R.I.P) and cooked eggs in the small GIPFEL pan with no problem - 1st use.I also used the large GIPFEL pan to cook up some cabbage and sausage, again. no sticking and no problem.Another tip with stainless, if you do get some sticking, is to immediately clean it while it is still somewhat hot, your sticky bits will come off easier.And one more tip, while I am at it, is that there are times when you want sticky bits and stainless is the pan that chefs use to make wonderful sauces and gravy from that ""fond"" on the bottom of the pan which produces flavor found no where else.When these GIPFEL pans first arrived I was a little disappointed that they were not completely tri-ply. (Just the thick bottoms are tri-ply) I had understood that real chefs only use pans that are constructed with tri-ply throughout which produces a thicker sidewall and thus better heat retention. But once I used these pans a bit, I realized that it did not seem necessary to have this feature as the food cooks fine and the thinner side walls of the pans make for a lighter pan and easier usage.

It definitely meant for a smaller apartment or such smaller space definitely convenient these are nonstick and I have cooked quite a few things that should have stuck to the sides to see if I could get anything to stick and they definitely don’t. They’re very easy to clean, when cooking they definitely distribute heat throughout the whole pan so everything cooks thoroughly at the same time. There is no part of the pan that gets hotter than the other. It definitely even distributes which is nice. I love the fact that you can take some thing out of the oven with the handle and place it on the stove top without having to use an oven or such , is there definitely versatile you can put them in the fridge with a cover after they have cooled down you can put them in the oven. You can cook them on the stove top. I love the handle is so convenient and could just be stored in the top pot. I do wish that there would’ve been two handles because when you’re cooking more than one thing on the stove top and you need the handle to hold the pan, you have to keep switching back-and-forth between pans , but other than that that is the only downside that I have found so far, these are definitely a win-win and worth the money . I saw these all over and I was not sure what the hype was until I got them and I definitely understand why if I could compare these to my high end, where I definitely would in the aspect that a lot of things I looked for in my expensive cookware, I have found in these.

The sizes are just right, and the footspace for storage is minimal. I decided to put one to the test with the most likely sticky candidate dish: eggs. I made a frittata, starting it on stovetop, sautéing the veggies and meat, then adding the egg. I popped the pan in the oven and dissociated the handle (great feature, BTW). When it came out, I let it cool on the stovetop for a couple of minutes, then I used a stiff silicone spatula to cut it. The pieces came out flawless! No sticking at all, and I didn't even add any extra fat/oil before adding the egg! This induction compatible cooking set is a perfect addition to our kitchen!Update on review: After having these for a couple of months I want to double my 5 star rating to 10 stars!

It was impossible to get a picture that wouldn\'t reflect everything around it (the finish is mirror-like). You do have to be careful about placing it on the smallest burner and centering it over the flame part. Otherwise the weight of the skillet\'s handle will throw off the balance (but once the egg is in it, it isn\'t iffy. The second photo shows the egg right after I put it in the skillet into which I had already melted some butter. You can see how nicely the bottom of the skillet fits that single egg. In the third photo you see the egg after I flipped it over. The third one shows the finished product: the cooked egg on top of buttered pumpernickel toast. And the final photo shows the small utensils I bought to go with the skillet. They sell here on Amazon as a two-piece set and both fit nicely in the skillet. Easily removed the egg from the skillet. They popped up when I searched the site for ""small spatulas""... not sure if I\'m allowed to post the link in this review, so I won\'t.IMPORTANT: The directions say to use the skillet over medium heat.

The pots are stylish, solid (almost too heavy for everyday use) and very attractive. Glass lids are wonderful to take some of the guesswork out of cooking. Since I am left-handed, I love the two-sided spout feature of the saucepan. What I don\'t like is that the handles don\'t necessarily screw on all the way, so one wonders about long-term stability. The lid knobs are also bakelite and also screw on, creating the same uncertainty. Now these pots are described as ""dishwasher safe"", and bakelite is stable when subjected to heat, so the handles and lid knobs shouldn\'t have to be removed when being washed. Therefore why the screw-on design? The handles all have rotatable metal hooks for ease in hanging; I would have preferred less rotation and more stability.

I’d been wanted to ditch my non-stick cookware for several years for health reasons but couldn’t find the right fit. I’m spoiled by growing up cooking with only non-stick cookware. And I’m NOT a good cook so I tend to overheat pans & burn food. AND I sooo dislike cleaning up after cooking that I’d prefer to do it later (like the next day). I’m possibly the worst case scenario for testing any cookware line. I’d honestly much rather enjoy being served nice meals in restaurants. But, I’m immunocompromised so COVID changed all that. So, I’ve needed to up my game & learn to cook decently.I first tested several brands of stainless steel cookware. It was a total nightmare for me to clean. I then tried out ceramic cookware but found it to be too heavy for my arthritic joints. After reading about and researching Hestan’s Nanobond’s titanium coating, I thought it sounded promising & ordered this pan. Besides, the design of all of Hestan’s cookware is simply gorgeous.This Hestan Nanobond pan turned out to be AMAZING. My 1st test was fried eggs that turned out perfect with no sticking and easy cleanup afterwards. I’d read to heat the pan first, then add the oil/butter next & let it heat, and to then add the eggs. That definitely works to make the surface as close to being non-stick without actually having a non-stick coating. I’ve used it repeatedly for sticky foods like fried eggs, scrambled eggs, grilled cheese sandwiches, etc. with thrilling results. Best of all, it’s easy to clean afterwards.The Hestan Nanobond cookware is fantastic & suits my needs perfectly. I’ve now bought many more of the pots and pans in all shapes & sizes. I’m thrilled with the good looks & performance of the Nanobond line, the ease of cleaning up afterwards, and the titanium coating’s overall forgivingness for bad cooks. I accidentally added ground sausage needing to be browned for a casserole directly to their still-warming 3.5 quart sauté pan. The sausage stuck immediately to the bottom & I knew I’d really screwed up. While stirring the rest of the meat with only a silicon spatula, however, the stuck remnants surprisingly released completely from the bottom! I then decided to go ahead & try baking the entire casserole in the covered Nanobond pan in the oven instead of dirtying up a casserole dish. The casserole turned out fantastic with perfectly browned sides & bottom. The servings easily released from the pan without falling apart. And the very baked-on food remnants STILL cleaned up easily. The beautiful design of Hestan’s cookware really makes it equally appealing for stove/oven to table presentation.

I am hesitant to buy the larger skillets if they are going to be super thin like the 8 inch is.BOTTOM LINE:I think I’m going to love this pan for scrambled eggs, and I don’t know what else.. I plan to try a reverse sear with salmon or a hamburger.. I usually slow cook vegetables in an enameled cast iron sauce pan, so I don’t have to worry about salt and other seasonings leaching the SS.. But I suppose I will try some vegetables in the nano bond titanium (as a little browning is supposed to add a layer of flavor.. but I suspect browning anything is less healthy).STICK, OR NOT TO STICK?Mystery solved.. I was perplexed by so many reviews complaining about things sticking to the titanium nanobond, because my scrambled eggs were sliding around, almost like a nonstick pan. I just watched a video comparison of three different stainless steel pans.. The Heston nanobond, and demeyere (both of which I have cooked scrambled eggs on).. In the video they got the pans hot until the water drops danced around, which I think of it as a trick that allows you to cook scrambled eggs in cast-iron.. Plus they used what looked like some kind of vegetable oil.. And the egg was stuck in the pan bad.. I use butter at a low temperature (which I believe is appropriate for eggs), and the eggs don’t stick at all..LEACHING INTO FOODI’ve always heard that titanium is extremely non-reactive, but I have been UNABLE to find any information (other than manufacturers claims) whether titanium cookware will leach anything into food while cooking (ie: acidic foods, like tomato paste, or how it’s well known that salt will pit stainless steel).. Titanium is supposed to be completely safe for humans, so we can only hope if anything leeches it would be pure titanium (manufacturers tend to be untrustworthy, I can only hope in Italy they have tighter regulations for such things than in America).. If you search the Internet you can find where testing was done with SS pans.. Some manufacturers claim you can cook tomato red sauce in them (even though tomatoes do leech from SS)..SUPER THIN?When I say super thin, perhaps I’m spoiled by using expensive aluminum clad cookware from other brands that have a hefty amount of aluminum.. Because of the high price of Heston nano bond cookware, they should pop for thick enough aluminum layer to where we should have to wonder if it’s enough.. And to be clear I don’t know how thick the aluminum layer needs to be to do. It’s job..The thin-ness of the pan makes me wonder if it would be prone to warping (with my other stainless steel pans, I clean them while they are hot, but I am fearful to put water into these thin nano bond skillets).. NOTE: I don’t put a lot of cold water into a hot pan, rather a little bit that steam cleans most of the pan (none of my pans have ever warped).HEAT MOMENTUM:The other problem with extra thin aluminum cladding is heat momentum.. Heat momentum is one of the reasons cast-iron pans work so well for certain things (such as putting a frozen hamburger patty, and getting heat momentum to create the seer.. instead of the frozen patty immediately cooling off the pan which destroys the seer). In my particular case, using the control freak induction burner that has a built-in temperature probe, it will probably compensate by instantly turning the power up (which I hear it doing when I take a little off, to try to maintain temperature).. I doubt the thin aluminum will work in this instance, if you’re trying to cook a frozen steak or anything substantial without cool in the pan off..NON-STICK:I have not used nonstick pans for decades, but I have been cooking scrambled eggs in aluminum clad stainless steel pans for years.. And for the past year. I’ve been using Demeyere SS skillets, which have a treated SS surface that concentrates the chromium and nickel and removes the iron (it makes the stainless steel, more stainless steel, and it does stick less than regular SS, but not by much)..[Again contrary to what many reviews are saying], when I cooked scrambled eggs in the Heston nanobond it felt like nonstick to me. There was an obvious non-stick quality even compared to my demeyere). Like my demeyere pans, I expect I will have to occasionally use the special cleaner, or barkeepers friend, to get rid of the haze/seasoning that develops (this is expected)..Likewise cleanup was very easy (like I would imagine non-stick would be).TOO—LIGHT—WEIGHT?I know other reviews think it’s thick/heavy, but it is by far the lightest pan I have ever held in my hands (and I’ve used a few different brands of aluminum clad stainless steel pans).. I realize titanium is light weight, but the nano bond is a very thin layer of titanium (presumably over stainless steel)..The pan is so light weight that it’s causing the problem with my control, freak induction burner.. The 8” or will sit flat by itself, but because it’s so light weight, and the handle is relatively heavy, it will not sit flat on the induction burner for preheating, because there is a temperature probe in the center (that has a lightweight spring)..And (when cooking anything sensitive to uneven heat) you very much need to preheat pans on an induction burner, because the nature of induction heats the pan itself so there is always a hot ring in the center of the pan that matches the induction ring (preheating for a while lets the heat spread out)..BOTTOM LINE: I was able to preheat the pan to cook my scrambled eggs, but one end of the pan was about 1/8” off the induction burner (and induction burners are sensitive to this.I WOULD HATE: to try to preheat the 8” pan for a seer on this induction burner (the 1/8” in the air might end up a huge problem at high power settings)..COOKING TECHNIQUES:There is technique to consider in whether eggs or anything sticks or not..For scrambled eggs I use low heat (228F.. since my induction burner controls the temperature).. and I use plenty of butter (I am convinced, low carb is healthy, and butter and egg yolks are healthy fats).. my eggs were sliding around the pan like the nonstick advertisements..CLEANUP:My experience with cleanup was like you would imagine nonstick. But I’ve seen many reviews complain about food sticking to the pan (I can only assume they were using high heat, and maybe little or no oil).. I can’t say for sure, but I know with my other stainless steel pans anytime something sticks, I just put a squeeze of dish soap and a little water and come back in an hour (or the next morning).. If I’m in a hurry, I’ll turn on the burner for a few seconds so warm soap will work faster.. Then whatever was stuck on usually falls off.. Sometimes I use vinegar (I don’t know whether dish soap vinegar would be more effective)..', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States May 20, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars Very high quality in ALMOST every area.', 'author': 'Teddy', 'rating': 4, 'content': 'Pros: the finish looks beautiful as it’s slightly a smoky grey color which is very smooth and though not nonstick is less sticky than other stainless steel pans I’ve used.

Mostly small nitpicks but for an expensive pan small can be big depending on your taste. Pricey. On my induction top at least the pan bottom warps very slightly so as thin coat of oil tends to pool towards the outer edges of the pan, this pretty common in a lot of pans but i do wish at this price it could be avoided.

Add food.I have used a pot and my large pan from this ten piece set so far; cooked ground beef and rice, veggies like mushrooms, onions, garlic, and bell peppers so far, as well as made creamed spinach. I have not experienced any sticking whatsoever and find the pans cook my food more evenly with less risk of burning. These are the best pans i have ever used!

I needed to replace my Greenworks pan (I’ve gone through a few of this brand, in different lines and sizes), and they work great at first, but if you burn something in it, they will never recover from it, and they do scratch even though you’re using a silicone or nylon spatula.I ran across this Japanese style egg pan (even though I really try to only buy made in USA, most affordable pans aren’t made so) and thought I may even be able to make a good omelette or “fry” eggs in it. And I did! (See photos)Preface: I don’t use it for the traditional Japanese omelettes as shown in the photos/video (wish I was that skilled!), just regular “western cooking”.Only used it a handful of times so far, but here’s my opinion:-You must use some kind of fat to cook in it: I tried an egg without any oil and it stuck to the bottom, though it never burned, but I was able to still get my egg off, albeit “broken”.-I made eggs a few times, used very little (like half a tsp of it) coconut oil or avocado oil, and the eggs just slid around the pan like nothing else!-You should keep it on medium/low (says not higher than 302F), and not heat it without food, so it won’t go in oven imho, but it does “fry” well at max 6-7 ( my electric stove has a 2-4-6-8-10 temperature, so I keep it between 6 and 8 usually, so medium): if you brush/spread or spray your oil in it and crack your egg on top, while your pan is just put on heat, it’ll still cook just perfectly so and slide off.-The fat really keeps it from sticking. If you do not plan to use any fat, this probably won’t work for things like eggs, but it’ll do “non fat” bacon or other food that releases some kind of fat even minimally.-I made an omelette (See photos) with inclusions, and it will make you a perfect rectangle, roll well with the provided spatula, and slide easily off onto your plate. Again, very little oil, but it is needed.-I also cooked turkey bacon it it, without any fat, and it crisped it up very well, then came clean with a damp paper towel.-It will wipe off clean with a paper towel or you can wash it with dish soap and a soft sponge (no scrubbing) if you must, but it’s almost unnecessary if you wet the paper towel first.It’s light enough to work with one hand, but it’s not a super-light pan like some flimsy ones. Seems very solid with a thick bottom.Conclusion:-I’ve used this pan only maybe 10 times, so I can’t really tell you how long it’ll last (I didn’t rate that part). I don’t plan to forget it on stove like I’ve done with another pan (yeah I know, my fault), so if all the above happens, this pan will probably last me a very long time.The rectangular size is perfect for many things including ham or bacon.Always use oil, or butter if you must.Only “cons” I can think of is, I wish it came with a lid, as I don’t think I’ll ever find one that’ll fit, and I’d probably pay a pretty penny for one, if I really wanted it, cause of its size. But it doesn’t take anything away from the pan’s functionality.There was another brand that did come with a lid, but this one sold me for some reason.I’m very happy with my purchase so far.

Seasoning is necessary for both.', 'author': 'Judy L.', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'I have been a user of cast iron pans for over 15 years. Many of the cast iron pans I have are very old, and were crusted pans that I had to strip the crud off them and season them before they could be used. Some are newer preseasoned pans that I often stripped the seasoning from them to season them again.When I discovered the carbon steel pans, I was intrigued as these pans are much lighter than cast iron. As a point of reference, I also have a number of Le Creuset and Staub pans and Dutch ovens that I love, but are also very heavy and relatively expensive. Before buying, I usually do research to find out about products I am not familiar with.In my research, I found out that materials used in carbon steel and cast iron pans are basically the same except that carbon steel contains 99% iron and 1% carbon vs. cast iron that contains 2%-3.5% carbon and less iron. The additional carbon causes cast iron to be more brittle, so pans are made thicker to help prevent breakage which also makes them much heavier. Since both have a high iron content, they must be oiled to prevent oxidation and rust. Both have pores that absorb oil when heated, hence the creation of the non-stick properties through ""seasoning"", but the pores in carbon steel are microscopic and much smaller than the pores in cast iron. Because of this, much less oil should be used to season carbon steel than cast iron. If you use too much oil, or do not remove the excess oil as the pans cool, you will end up with a sticky residue on the pan. This is true for both carbon steel and cast iron, and both require some simple maintenance by heating them and coating them with oil after each use. I, personally, use Crisco All Vegetable shortening.A couple reviews mentioned flaking of the surface after use. These pans come preseasoned and coated with a layer of wax to prevent oxidation (rust). The layer of wax must be cleaned off per the instructions before the first use. This is done by washing them in warm soapy water and wiping them with a scrubby sponge to get all the wax off. If this isn\'t done, the wax will flake off when used the first time.At this point, I truly love these pans and will likely sell some of my treasured cast iron. So, what do I love about these pans. 1 - They are so much lighter in weight than cast iron. 2 - These pans are nonstick with the seasoning already on the pans and only gets better with time and proper seasoning after each use. 3 - Carbon steel, as well as cast iron, will continue to look like new if cleaned and seasoned after each use. 4 - Heats and cools much faster than cast iron. For both, medium to medium high heat is all that is needed. 5 - Can be used on the stove and in the oven as well as an induction cook top. 6 - Since carbon steel cools faster than cast iron, it is less likely to burn foods that are not immediately removed. 7 - Nest together well and take less storage space than most other pan. 8 - Can stack together and use metal utensils without the fear of scratching them.In conclusion, I would definitely recommend these pans if you are willing to take the time to maintain them. If you can do this, they will last for years to come.UPDATE 03/31/22:I have 3 of these pans in 8"", 10"", and 12"" sizes, and the two pictured are the ones I have used the most. In the last 4 weeks, I have used these pans quite often, and so far, they are totally non-stick and have not changed in color as I expected them to. Maybe it is something in the way I take care of them. After using them, they are washed with soap and water without any scrubbing. I totally dry them by heating them on the stove to open the pores of the pan, and then add a very small amount of Crisco oil on a paper towel to coat them with oil. After a couple more minutes of heating, I use a paper towel to remove any excess oil. As they cool, more oils beads on the surface of the pan, and this is again wiped off. Before I store them, I wipe them again with a kitchen towel. Although I fully expect these pans to change color over time, it\'s possible they stay looking nice by not letting excess oils stay on them. I do know that leaving excess oil on these pans or on cast iron pans will cause a sticky residue to develop. Built up oils on these pans or cast iron will cause them to look really cruddy and will reduce the nonstick capabilities of both.UPDATE 4/07/22:Today, I found out something about carbon steel pans the hard way. Cooking acidic foods in a carbon steel pan removes the seasoning. I made brats with sauerkraut in one of my carbon steel pans. I browned the brats, and then added the sauerkraut to the pan to heat it with the brats. The pan was fine until I cleaned it and found that part of the seasoning was gone. The pan was down to the bare grey metal in spots. Although this doesn\'t damage the pan, it has to be heated, oiled, and cooled a couple of times to season it again and regain the nonstick qualities of the pan. I also want to mention that when searing meat, you need to get a good sear on the meat before turning it. If you don\'t, the meat will stick.UPDATE 5/13/22:I have added pictures of my 8"" and 10"" pans that have been used quite a lot since I got them a couple of months ago. I am extremely happy with the nonstick quality of these pans and that they are so very much lighter than my cast iron pans. After every use, I season them as described previously, and so far they haven\'t changed in color. Personally, I believe this is because I don\'t let the oil burn on the pan when I season it as I have also found this to be true with my cast iron pans. All of my cast iron is an even dark black color and also nonstick. In the past, I have had a couple of cast iron pans change color when oil had been left on it for too long and burned. Although the color of the pans will get darker with use and seasoning, I don\'t think they have to become ugly if the patina is developed evenly.I hope this review was helpful for you.

How to Keep it Non-stick/UPDATED"", 'author': 'dsk', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'UPDATE 12/20/2024:I loved the 10"" skillet so much, I bought the 12"". They are my goto skillets, without a doubt. I use them daily, many times more than once per day. These are the only pans that I use to make eggs. So, my Merten and Storck fry pans have been used dozens and dozens of times. I\'ve ordered an induction range which will arrive day after tomorrow. These pans will work great on the induction cooktop. I\'ll update with info on how they do with induction and how I have to adapt.I was making tuna patties tonight in the 12"" pan. To this day, both pans are non-stick, and I mean so darn slippery that it takes a spatula plus another implement on the other side to flip anything. Even fried eggs just slide around. The pans are almost too slippery.I detailed how to season the pans to keep them nonstick in my original review. I\'ve learned that after reheating and rubbing oil on them a few times that it becomes unnecessary. They\'ll stop soaking up the oil. When you see this, then simply wash them under hot water (when they\'ve cooled down) and dry. I rarely use dish detergent. I have a BLUE 3M scrubber that I use. I only use the BLUE, because it\'s non-scratch. If I think the pan needs more, I\'ll put a very small amount of Dawn on the scrubbing pad, wet it in hot water, wash, rinse, and dry. That\'s all there is to it. I\'ve had no issues with rust. My pans hang on the wall. You can see where oil has polymerized in a couple of places on the cooking surface. This is correct and what it\'s supposed to do. Don\'t scrub it off! It\'s a part of the seasoning. There are 2 things I never do:1. I never soak the pans.2. I never run cool or tepid water into a hot pan to clean it. I always cool them down. Original review:I\'ve read reviews where people think these pans are coated with a nonstick material; they aren\'t. I\'ve also read that you should treat them like cast iron; you DON\'T. Here\'s the right information.First, the pans may have a bluish hue. It\'s not from an applied finish. When you heat carbon steel, you get blue heat marks. Certain metals will so this when heated. You see it more readily in silver colored pans and it\'s natural.These pans are extremely preseasoned. I fried eggs over easy this morning, and they slipped around the pan so much, I had a hard time turning them! This is how you want these pans to perform. I have a carbon steel wok (that was Not pre-seasoned) and I\'ve never had one thing stick in it.Unlike cast iron, you should wash your COLD carbon steel pan, using dish soap, rinsing well. Never ever put a hot pan in cool water; it\'ll warp.After washing and drying, sit your skillet back on the stove. Turn it on to medium-low. Heat the pan. When the pan is hot, use a paper towel to apply cooking oil. You can use olive oil. I think a higher temp oil is better, like corn or vegetable oil. Don\'t let the pan overheat. Just rub the oil around. You\'ll see it disappear into the pan. When the pan isn\'t taking anymore, turn off the burner. After the pan cools, simply wipe off any excess oil and put it away.That\'s all there is to it. Don\'t put in the dishwasher. Just hand wash with dish soap, dry it, heat on a burner and apply oil. It\'ll stay extremely slick.BTW, if you buy a pan that isn\'t seasoned, it\'ll come with a coating of shellac on it to protect against rust. You have to heat it on high heat and burn the shellac off, scrubbing the soot. When you\'re done, the pan looks like these pans, black with a bluish hue.The 10"" skillet is a nice weight without being too heavy. The metal handle doesn\'t get hot when cooking on the stove.

It also doesn't hold much heat like cast iron, so you are constantly fiddling with the flame to keep it cooking but not burning, but it does a decent job of distributing the heat.With regard to seasoning: if you cook tomato anything, bye-bye seasoning. Any acidic food is a no-no unless you're ready to re-season.Cleanup: highly recommend the method of scrubbing it with coarse salt and a paper towel. This is safe and removes the gunk while leaving the seasoned layer alone. Try to keep water and soap away from your carbon steel pan!

Worth noting if you're used to Teflon coated pans you might have some trouble. When new, Teflon pans are so non-stick you really don't need any fat in them. Cast iron, carbon steel, and stainless all rely on sufficient fat to make them work. You should also get them a bit hot before you drop the fat in. In a 10in pan like this, I use almost 2 tablespoons of butter before dropping in a few eggs for frying. With this pan, they slide around like crazy when I jiggle the pan.This is my first carbon steel pan. I notice they're very much like cast iron in a lot of ways, but much better in two important characteristics.The first is that they are much lighter. This is obvious, but after using cast iron for a while it's easy to appreciate how much easier it is to flip food with a simple motion of the pan rather than needing a spatula.The second is that, unless most cast iron on this price range, the carbon steel pan is smooth. This makes it super slick when you use it right.Last, like others have noted, you need to take some care when you're done to make sure it keeps working. It becomes second nature after a while. Most of the time I just wipe it out with a paper towel till it looks clean. If there are stuck on bits, I'll use hot soapy water till it's clean and then heat till dry then do a super thing oil coating and let it smoke for a little.

Although it is heavier than it looks, it is quite sturdy and well made. I’ve only had it for a couple of days now, but made quite a few meals already. We have an electric stove top that’s infamous for not heating our pans evenly, burning some parts and not heating others at all. That was not the case at all with this skillet! We made pancakes in it and they turned out wonderfully golden brown and not half-cooked like with our other pans. My fiancé accidently cooked some vegetables in a sauce a little too long that wound up burning quite badly. I wasn’t too happy that she almost ruined our brand-new and quite frankly, expensive pan. After a quick soak though, it was as good as new! Not a speck of burnt residue or discoloration at all! I was amazed. After scorching a chicken dish, my fiancé and I learned that we do not need to use as high heat as with our other pans, which is nice. Like I said, the pan is heavier than it looks and quite deep for a pan of its size. We got adventurous and used it to try our hand at frying (this time shrimp tempura), which was catastrophic with other pans. Because the skillet is so deep, we were able to fit enough oil and shrimp without spattering and making a mess. The oil stayed at a constant temperature and they turned out wonderfully. After mastering the temperature difference (you’d be surprised), we also used less oil and butter because nothing stuck and so much healthier for us. The pan is still as shiny as when we first got it, after all of our mishaps. We just soaked it in warm water with some soap for a while and most of it came off under the running water! We didn’t even need to use a scrubby sponge (which I don’t recommend on any pan, reason we are buying a new one).

Regardless, I prefer a more well balanced and stable design for the peace of mind.In comparison, I also have 'vintage' stainless steel cookware passed down from my grandparents and Emiril stainless steel/copper bottom cookware. Both are very well designed, counter balanced well, very safe and effective to use, easy to clean.Cleaning: this pan is a nightmare to scrub clean. Scrambled eggs are the worst. In spite of preheating and using cooking oil or sometimes a small amount of butter to coat the pan before use, removing the debris afterward is beyond even a steel wool brillo pad.I finally bought a small chain-mail scrubber but even with that, it takes at least 10lbs of down-force and a good 1-2 minutes of scrubbing to remove debris and then a follow up with a brillo pad for good measure. I've also tried soaking it with dish soap for hours and even overnight. Even that barely loosens up the debris.My other stainless steel cookware cleans up easily. It requires a soak sometimes but nothing more than that. I don't know why this is so difficult. I've used a lot of cookware over the years and never had an issue like this. I suppose a metallurgist would have to explain.Bottom line, your experience may be completely different. Aside from the two issues I have with this, it is well made and should last indefinitely short of it being physically damaged. If the supplier addresses the two issues above (different steel alloy?) and the balance issue, I'd give it 5 stars. As-is, the best I can do is 2 stars."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 9, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars They make good products!', 'author': 'Michael J.

These pans are superior to the original pans and the originals ended up in the camper. Much heavier duty with better handles with the same great non stick coating. I have bought some very expensive pans from Pampered Chef, SS with the nonstick hexagonal finish, and it is a awesome pan. It is also cost me 180.00 dollars. These pans cost only one third the price and work just as good. No doubt the PC pans will last longer but you can\'t beat the price and value of Granitestone.One thing to remember is you cannot use scotchbrite pads, or any abrasive pads not only on these pans or any nonstick pan for that matter. Running water cleans most of everything out of the pan. Nor can you use any nonstick sprays. The sprays leave a sticky residue that will that eventually lead to a unusable pan. I use a high smoke point oil like peanut or vegetable in a special hand oil sprayer. You can use one of the pump up sprayers but I found the hand sprayer is easier to use with no overspray.Ok now I have to debunk other reviewers claim that the pans are not non stick or their pans scorched while cooking. I really don\'t know how peoples perception of what non stick means is formed. If you cook food in a pan some will end up on the sides or bottom and WILL adhere to the pan. It will happen in all pans. How the pan cleans up is where the ""non stick meets the pan"" to coin a phrase! You can of course use a large amount of oil but that is not why you bought these pans. You can use a small amount of oil, which improves the cooking and flavor of your food. Why do you think when you try to make something at home that you had in a restaurant it never tastes as good. These pans are way better than Copper Chef or any of the pans that have a smooth finish. I did not think that would be the case.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States April 11, 2021', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great set of pans', 'author': 'RandomGS', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Bought over a month ago, and had to loop back to review this great pan set.

They began to lose their nonstick coating some time last year with almost daily use. A bit of unattended spinach is now a permanent addition to them (I had Covid, mkay?), and thus the most commonly used pans in this set are no longer nonstick. There\'s also a slight warp in the biggest one - oil runs off the center. It\'s fine for greasy foods, but things like potstickers and eggs need a different pan. If I need to brown something that requires a bit of scraping to deglaze, a steel-bottom pot is still my go-to, as nothing comes off these pans easily anymore. Hope that helps someone looking for a lifelong friend in their pans - I don\'t think these are it. They gave me a good 3 years, though. Cheers.ORIGINAL 11/2022: I\'ve been using these pans for a year in December. I waited a long time to write a review because as someone who cooks A LOT, I wanted to let others know how these hold up over time. So, this review is after a year of almost daily use.My husband got me the 3-pan set for Christmas. There are no lids, just to clarify. Right away I noticed that the surface coating feels a lot like teflon. After a good scrub with a nonscratch sponge, I filled them all with water and lemon to try and boil away the weird smell they were putting off. I tasted the weird chemical odor in the food, too. So I took my time trying to cook/scrub/boil away the smell. I have a sensitive nose, so this may not bother others. The smell did eventually go away after about a week of heavy use.Right away I noticed that the handle rivets on all 3 leak. This isn\'t a problem with water, but with oil it could be a hazard. I took a picture of the handle rivets and the oil burned on to show where it leaks from.How have they held up after a year? So-so. I cook all manner of dishes in these, from morning potatoes to shakshuka, to alfredo, to Thai fried rice. And I\'m cooking for 5, so the biggest pan is always on the stove. My clan has very strict instructions regarding my pans: No metal utensils. No dishwashers. No hot/cold shocks (cold water on a hot pan). That\'s it. Still, somehow, these pans that claim to be safe for metal utensils have scratches in them. I tried to get the pictures, I hope Amazon preserves the quality so you can see. Also, there is discoloration in the center of the pan, and it\'s no longer 100% nonstick.I\'ve noticed through the years that teflon has about a year of heavy use before it comes off. Nearly the same here, except whatever they used on these pans doesn\'t flake off, it just kind of gets... thin? After a year, I have to be more careful with oil and food placement in these pans to avoid things sticking. Things take a bit more coaxing now to be ""nonstick."" It\'s problematic for sunny-side-up eggs, which need to be able to slide around in order to get that perfect cooked white and runny yolk. The other two pans in the set aren\'t as abused as this one and have held up much better, preserving their nonstick nature.These pans also do not transfer heat very well. That\'s just what you get for having light, easy-to handle pans. My ancient stovetop has hotspots and you can even see in the picture exactly where this hotspot is - by the handle, as I always place the handle in the same place when I cook. I think it\'s a worthwhile trade, honestly, because that\'s literally the only thing keeping me from using cast iron instead - the weight. My wrists can\'t handle a heavy pan AND 5+ pounds of food. So these are great for that.The curved edges of the pan allow me to flip food easily without having to reach for a utensil. And despite my occasional abuse (I have 3 kids, once in a great while things get burnt, mkay?), the surface coating isn\'t flaking off. Four out of 5 stars because they\'re holding up better than teflon, but they just don\'t make that 5/5 star rating for nonstick immortality.For anyone who manages to burn things onto your pans, put that metal scraper away. Just boil lemon juice or vinegar in the pan, get a wooden spatula, and gently scrape away the burnt stuff. Works great on stainless steel, too.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States November 18, 2022', 'is_verified': True}]"

It\'s a REALLY expensive non-stick pan... And since non-stick isn\'t an heirloom product like Cast Iron or even Stainless Steel, I hate the idea of spending so much on a pan that will need to be replaced in a few years.First: some background... I cook daily, and geek out on equipment. I have a selection of cast iron pans (lodge, utopia, finex), enameled cast iron (le creuset, lodge), non-stick (calphalon), high carbon steel (mauviel and BK), and stainless (all-clad). In other words, I own and use a LOT of pans.With that said, for truly non-stick purposes, and convenience, this is one of my favorite pans in the house now. And THAT is saying something!Longevity: It\'s nice that it\'s titanium ceramic (""stratanium"") and they claim it will last for many years more than a normall non-stick. We shall see.High Heat: Because there\'s no teflon, this can be heated to a HIGH temperature (600 degrees) and thus can be used to sear, without concerns of toxic fumes/particles. It can be thrown into the oven as well, which is really nice.Non-Stick: This pan is absolutely non-stick like you dream about. A tiny bit of butter, and my omlettes release and slide around in the pan with no issue at all. A quick wipe and the whole pan is clean. This is SO great for eggs, sauteeing veggies, etc. Really enjoying the very high performance non-stick properties.Handling: The pan is HEAVY - and this is a good thing. It is sold, and heats evenly, which is exactly what you want. It\'s not heavy on the level of a cast iron pan, but it\'s definitely got heft to it, which means that it heats very evenly, and feels nice in the hand. The hanlde itself is very ergonomic, and the slopes to the sides of the pan are steep enough to give a good amount of flat frying space, while being JUST right for pan tossing food (thus, sautee).I\'m seriously considering buying a second one of these, and just throwing out my previous set of (perfectlly serviceable) non-stick pans.

Size: 14-piece set. Composition: 5 ceramic coated pots with aluminium core + bakelite handles, 3 glass and bakelite lids, two silicon utensils, 4 cushioned polyester pot protectors. The four elements in this cooking set (8"" & 9.5"" frying pans, 11"" sauté pan with lid, 2 qt. saucepan with lid, 4.5 qt. casserole with lid) include the essential sizes for an equipped kitchen. Ceramic is great to cook with because it avoids lots of sticky problems, and the included silicon tools make this feature even better. The pots are stylish, solid (almost too heavy for everyday use) and very attractive. Glass lids are wonderful to take some of the guesswork out of cooking. Since I am left-handed, I love the two-sided spout feature of the saucepan. What I don\'t like is that the handles don\'t necessarily screw on all the way, so one wonders about long-term stability. The lid knobs are also bakelite and also screw on, creating the same uncertainty. Now these pots are described as ""dishwasher safe"", and bakelite is stable when subjected to heat, so the handles and lid knobs shouldn\'t have to be removed when being washed. Therefore why the screw-on design? The handles all have rotatable metal hooks for ease in hanging; I would have preferred less rotation and more stability.

Now the stain that you see on the bottom of the pots in the pictures, I don’t know what caused that because at the time I was just scrambling eggs and after finishing up with the eggs I let the pot cool before washing them(as stated in the manual) when I went to wash the pot I saw these marks on the bottom, i thought that after washing it they’ll probably go away, sadly it did not. For a whole week I was trying to figure out what caused this to happen, after using the other pots I realized that gradually all of the pots were having the same stain on the bottom so I figured it was either not compatible with gas stove (even tho they sated that it is) or the pots are just not well made as I thought.

The build quality is excellent.If you cook with stainless steel correctly, and use it to cook the type of dish that it is best suited for then you will really love this pan as I do.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 9, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Love this pan!', 'author': 'JanK', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Just the right size and cleans up esy.

MADE IN GERMANY', 'author': 'Michael Y.', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Well, I have yet to find a really durable non-stick pan, these pans all have sprayed on coatings and on every one ive ever seen the coating eventually fails - its just a question of when. The infomercials make wild claims that dont even match the pans own instructions of use, how they get away with this is baffling. They often iimpress at first use and get glowing reviews, then at some point its in the trash - to be fair this is often as much to do with improper use of metal utensils on a non stick surface as anything, but ive had pans I treated with kid gloves and still the coating failed. OK call me negative but its the truth 99.5% of the time and its something only time will tell. So, that aside I will say this pan makes a great first impression - the nice looking if not unusual coating and pan construction seem to indicate better than average quality and durability based on ther pans feel and weight as well as thickness. I especially like the very well made handle that will never burn me and looks very much like real wood but is really a man made high heat synthetic, and thats fine as long as it holds up, but the handle is one of the best ive seen far as comfort and safety go -- the down side is you can not put this pan in the oven with this type handle, and im not faulting the pan for this because the manufacturer tells you this in the instructions and I knew this going in so if you want such a pan buy one made to go in the oven. - Ive only used the pan three times so far and can not deny I am impressed, I lightly cleaned and wiped the pan dry, then fried eggs sunny side up and there was no sticking they slid out with almost no coaxing. Then with no cleaning I fried some breakfast sausage and the pan proved easy to work with and cooked the sausage nice and evenly, no sticking and the sausage came out great. Finally, leaving all the sausage remnants in the pan untouched I fried two more eggs sunny side up, and again there was no sticking the eggs slid right out with no issues - again its still early in the game but I found this very encouraging, often frying an egg after sausage makes it hard to retrieve the egg - but not in this case, in fact though I am a nonstick skeptic I already love this pan -- but I know in my heart only time will show how good a companion this pan proves to be. I would say if this pan could deliver say, five to seven years of this kind of performance its a bargain for $30, almost nothing today is built to last like things used to so the five to seven year rule is just my opinion and in todays world not many things last five to seven years, so I figure that would be a very good lifespan for a $30 non stick pan, and hopefully being made in Germany will mean something as far as build quality making it a realistic projection - but so far I have nothing bad at all to say about the pans performance or overall build quality, given what I know so far of it the $30 price seems well in line and for now I have to say its a solid performer and definitely one to try if youre looking, its not a run of the mill TV ad clone and its one of the reasons I pulled the trigger. Ive only seen the one size so far, hopefully there will be and 8 and 12 inch available, because if it proves itself good I definitely want another one or two of these pans.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States September 20, 2019', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Beautiful pots.', 'author': 'Deborah Finch', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Durability and charm.

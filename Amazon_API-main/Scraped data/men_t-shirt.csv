I put them on to see how annoying the tags may or may not be, and that\'s when I discovered the other sewn-in tag - it\'s a ""Lacoste"" branding tag sewn right across the middle of the rear section of the waistband. This smaller tag is actually more noticeable as you\'re wearing the briefs because the stitching results in an abrasive edge, and it sits right on your spine so you feel it anytime you\'re sitting down. And like the other 5 tags, this little needless tag is sewn in to stay, and cannot be ripped out without damage. Most manufacturers have been making underclothing without sewn-in tags for many years, so it\'s amazing that a brand as well known and established as Lacoste is putting out men\'s briefs with not jut tags, but absolute tag overkill.

My partner and I have so many of these. I wear a Large, she wears a Medium or Small. They are soft, comfortable and easy to wear/easy to pair. They make a great night shirt too! The first few times wearing these, even just on their own, you will see truly, they present well actually. So many things you can do with a simple white shirt. Even to tie-dye! They will however become softer overtime. Making the choice of do I purchase more, the true question? YES! They are worth it! My only real complaint is they shrink overtime, as will any other shirt made with cotton. So please make note of that, the smalls are great, but will get smaller, the mediums are just a inch or two too big for my partner, so she keeps both sizes in stock, haha. She is 5'7 and 120-140 lbs. When 120- wears small, when 140-wears medium. I wear a large and weigh 140-165. When I am 140 I fit into a medium but a large is more comfortable, when I am 165 the large is just right. I am also 5'7.I hope this helps! I do use bleach on occasion to help freshen them up, it will help bring back out that pearly white tone again on only the newer ones, but eventually purchasing a few more is always the best decision as they fade over time! Only bad thing I would say is when washed with other bright colors, they will fade. Keeping them separate and wash with whites in cold water to prevent loosing that bright white color.

I am 5\'8"" and 140"", I do not like tight T-shirts so I bought a large. I am happy with it, although I am sure that a medium would have worked.I will compare the Gilden T-shirt with the Fruit of the Loom Platinum that you will see at Wal-Mart.Pro - The Gilden appears to be better built and the sizing was consistent on the two T-shirts that came in the package. The neck was smaller, without being tight. I am guessing that fabric around the neck will not wrinkle up, unlike many Fruit of the Looms. There were no loose threads, unlike many Fruit of the Loom. Gilden has heavier fabric, which is better most of the year where I live (east Tennessee). I do not want a see-through T-shirt. Also, no one who sees me would want me wearing a see-through T-shirt.Con - The Fruit of the Loom is much softer after a first washing. I washed the Gildan T-shirt in warm water with two minutes in the dryer on Energy-Saving. Gilden has a tag which is not as good as Fruit of the Loom (no tag). I cut the tag out without any problem and now the Gilden is fine. Gilden is slightly more expensive but both brands are inexpensive.Neutral - Neither brand bleeds color. I have only washed the Gilden one time so I do not know whether it will fade. My Fruit of the Loom T-shirts fade but it takes many washes for that to occur.I hope that this review is helpful to you.Update - June 2, 2020. The Gildan T-shirts that I bought previously held up reasonably well for the money. They did not shrink. They did not fade. However, they did not get softer. Washing was on warm and drying was three minutes on energy saver.I purchased some more Gildans to replace the ones that wore out. I have not washed them yet. I bought Galapagos Blue and Orange in Large size. Both are 100% cotton. The necks seem smaller than the Fruit of the Loom Platinums that I own. I like that because I have a small head so I don\'t need a big neck. I am still 5\'8"" and 140 pounds and the Large is comfortable for me. A medium would probably fit me better; however, I like a looser-fitting T-shirt.I will let you know how well the new Gildans do after washing in warm water and drying for three minutes on energy saving heat.Notably, I have some old Fruit of the Loom T-shirts (like ten years or more) which are reasonably thick, reasonably soft, and still going strong after all this time. I wish that I had bought more of them.June 10, 2020 - After one wash in warm water and three minutes in the dryer, the new Gildans did not shrink or fade. Also, the necks did not stretch. However, the T-shirts did not become softer. Therefore, three out of the four results were good and one result was neutral.September 20, 2020 - After multiple washings in warm water and three minutes in the dryer on ""energy saving"", the verdict is the same. Good - the T-shirts did not shrink or fade and the necks did not stretch. Bad - The T-shirts did not get any softer. One other note - the tags on the T-shirts would be very annoying to wear so I cut the tags out.November 22, 2020 - The first thing to go bad on these T-shirts has been that the necks have stretched slightly. The stretching was not terrible but it is noticeable (at least to me). Nevertheless, I would give the T-shirts 4.5 stars. They do seem a little but softer or maybe I am getting more used to them. They do not feel scratchy to me. They have not faded or shrunk. I definitely like them much better than the ultra-thin Fruit of the Loom Platinum.November 28, 2020 - I have purchased only Large-size Gildan T-shirts. I am very happy that the sizing has been very consistent. Gildan has much better quality control than Fruit of the Loom.March 11, 2021 - I have revised the rating to a five stars. The T-shirts have gotten soft after probably 10 - 12 washings. The necks have stretched slightly but not very much. I am picky about that so I may notice that more than most people would. I dry the T-shirts by putting them in the dryer on energy saving setting for three minutes and then laying them on a bamboo drying rack. I do NOT dry them by putting them on hangers. The T-shirts still look great with no fading. I wear them frequently and enjoy the various colors.September 16, 2021 - The T-shirts are still doing well. One note, I think that the 6.0 weight fabric is much better than the 5.3 weight fabric. I bought some 5.3 weight lime green T-shirts to try to make myself more visible when walking. The necks have sagged after four washes. They served the purpose for the summer. However, I would not buy the 5.3 ounce again. The 6.0 ounce T-shirts have maintained their shape with minimal neck sagging or crinkling.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States July 8, 2018', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Fits nice and a great value', 'author': 'David F', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'These shirts fit nice, are comfortable, look good, and are a great value.

There are two tags, each somewhat stiff material that is irritating. On shirts like this I cut the tags off close to the seam. Still, it would be nicer without the tags.Size wise‚Ä¶ this seems to be reasonably accurate‚Ä¶ for me at least. I am a bit over 6 feet tall, with wide shoulders and slim torso.

These are great work shirts and just general usage shirts and the only decent t-shirt with a pocket anymore.* Durability for cheap. For $7 a shirt you get a fairly beefy cotton that doesn\'t rip the instant it catches on anything. It holds up well in the wash. The dye doesn\'t seem to fade. I can\'t tell the difference between two year old and two month old shirts.* Pocket is nice. It\'s big enough to stuff your phone into it, but its better suited to light items that won\'t fall out due to gravity if you bend forward and stuff that you can clip to the edge of the pocket. Business cards, paper notes, pens, and small flashlights with pocket clips all do well in the pocket. If you put a phone in it expect it to flop out on the concrete if you bend forward more than 45 degrees.* Consistency. I\'ve bought 8 of these so far, two at a time over the course of about two years as I replaced my other work t-shirts. The sizing has not been altered in that time, nor has the material weight. I can\'t even tell the difference between the shirts from two years ago and the most recent ones, they don\'t even seem to have worn.* Modest cut. They lean toward the boxy side which is fine if you aren\'t trying to show off. If you\'re a little on the pudgy side it\'s actually preferable. When I first got these I was about 195 at 6\'1"", two years later I\'ve slimmed down while hitting the weights and sitting at 175 with a little more muscle in my upper torso and considerably less fat around my waist.

This shirt strikes the perfect balance between comfort, fit, and style, making it an essential wardrobe staple for men.First and foremost, the cotton fabric is of excellent quality. It's soft, breathable, and feels great against the skin. The midweight thickness is just right - not too heavy, not too light - making it suitable for year-round wear. Whether I wear it on its own during warmer months or layer it under a jacket in colder weather, it always feels comfortable and keeps me at the perfect temperature.The fit is spot on as well. The crewneck tee is cut in a way that offers a flattering shape without being too tight or too loose. The sleeves have just the right length, hitting the mid-bicep, which I find very comfortable and stylish.I also appreciate that Champion offers this tee in both regular and big & tall sizes, ensuring a perfect fit for all body types. The inclusivity in sizing is a big plus, and it's a testament to Champion's commitment to providing comfortable clothing for all men.The design is simple yet classic, with the iconic Champion logo subtly embroidered on the sleeve. This minimalistic approach allows the shirt to be versatile, easily paired with jeans, shorts, or activewear for various occasions.Moreover, this tee holds up well to washing and retains its shape and color.

I bought a purple one and the neck line was so tight that it felt like I was wearing a turtleneck without the turtle part (if that makes sense). I just bought a black one and same thing. Upon comparing the neck lines of another color bought at the same time (but did not fit that tight), ones I have had for a long time, and the ones with a different fitting neck, I could tell that they were all different. The ones that fit tight in the neck having a thicker band around the neck hole.

I normally wear a 2XL, and ordered a 2XL, and found the fit slightly loose. But that is how I prefer my shirts and T-Shirts to fit. These are soft and comfortable. I washed these in cold water and followed with a wet dry setting on the dryer. Then I hung them up to finish drying, which took little time. The one thing I do not like about these is the tag in the back. I would prefer the printed tag. These have 2 big tags, and when I say big, I mean they are long and stick out a way. They did not seem to irritate the back of my neck like most do though. I might end up cutting them off regardless. They feel as though they will be durable.

The length is as expected. But better a tad large, than too small, IMO. Also, they are not the softest shirt as they are bit on the coarser side. Not rough or scratchy by any means, just not super soft. A few washings has helped and I expect these shirts will last for a while.

There are no side seams to itch you. The back neck and shoulders are covered in fabric which is not always the case in undershirts. The front neck, armholes, cuffs, sleeve seams, and bottom hem are not fabric covered, but they are surged with a very soft thread which is much more comfortable than the surging in some of my other shirts that scratches and itches my skin. I was worried that the crew neck would annoy me since I don\'t like anything tight around my neck, but it is loose enough that I can get it over my head with my glasses on, plus you can stretch it a little both ways when the shirt is wet. The cotton in this shirt is soft and surprisingly heavy, not like a typical men\'s undershirt. It is more an outer shirt than an undershirt, but it could be worn under a roomy outer shirt. It has cuffs, which is a very nice feature especially if the sleeves are a little long on someone. The weight and texture of the shirt seems to be between a tee shirt and a very light weight sweatshirt. I am using one for sleeping and it feels soft against my face at night and keeps me warm but not hot. The arms are long on me which I expected since I am only 5 feet 4 inches tall and I ordered the size large shirt. The size chart indicated I should order a medium or even a small if I wanted a snug shirt, but I went with the large for the comfort and I\'m happy with the roominess. The sleeve width is roomy enough on me, but not too roomy. The construction of this shirt is excellent, in fact perfect except for a thread or two that was not cut off. I bought my shirts in the 10-pack and they arrived with all ten shirts ironed and folded in half neatly, all in one big plastic bag loosely taped shut and inside a big box. I didn\'t have a problem with the fact that each shirt was not individually wrapped, and in fact I can use the big plastic bag. Some reviewers said there were holes, unsewn seams and stains on their shirts, but mine were all in perfect new condition. I washed them and dried them in the dryer, but they do take a very long time to dry. I ended up hanging them up to complete the drying. The only negative thing I can say about this excellent shirt is that it has two very annoying scratchy tags sewn right into the back neck seam. You can\'t tear them off without ripping the stitches. I cut them out very carefully with tiny scissors. Here are the approximate dimensions of size large after washing and drying: underarm sleeve length 23"", sleeve circumference at shoulder 20.5"", sleeve circumference at middle of sleeve 15"", back width at top between sleeve seams 20.25"", circumference around the bottom 45.5"", length at back middle 29"".', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States December 30, 2021', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': ""5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect for a man who just can't bother"", 'author': 'Jason', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""Don't know what to wear?

I literally wear only these Gildan shirts anymore, and simplifying my wardrobe like this eliminated the stress of putting together an outfit.

The pack comes with a set of classic black tees, and the quality is fantastic.

The shirts are a bit tight at the top, especially around the shoulders and chest. As someone with a broader build, I found the snugness a little uncomfortable, especially during more active movements. It might be worth considering sizing up if you're in between sizes or prefer a looser fit.Despite the fit issue, I still appreciate the overall design and style of these shirts. The crew neck is classic and versatile, making it suitable for casual wear or even for layering with other outfits. The black color looks sharp and doesn't fade easily, maintaining its original richness.I was also pleased with how well these shirts retained their shape after several washes. They didn't shrink, and the collar didn't lose its structure, which is a problem I've encountered with some other brands.In terms of value for money, the Hanes Essentials Men's T-Shirt Pack is undoubtedly worth it.

L.', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'We buy these mostly as undershirts, but sometimes as tees for hot days. As a result, sometimes we get plain cotton in white for my husband and in black for myself (a female), and sometimes a cotton poly blend. So far, we like all of them. I noted in the Gildan boxer brief reviews that someone commented on oddities of sizing both for briefs and tees common in most brands. In boxer briefs, the waist size ""range"" may be ""42 to 44"" for example, but the real waist size would be 43"", which is the ""mean"". They speculated that since the tees are advertised as being for women as well as for men, but the chart basically shows chest measurements, women might find it difficult to make appropriate purchases. In reality, it just takes a little thought and understanding of one\'s own body build plus personal preferences. My husband, like many older men, has a bit of a tummy and prefers a fairly loose fit. He\'s 5\' 9"" and 195 lb. For his own use, we buy an XL. When buying a more body conscious tee from a brand such as ""Into the AM"", he\'s happiest in an XXL. When I buy a men\'s tee for myself, it is because most women\'s tees don\'t suit my body type. I hate cap sleeves, for one thing, and prefer a men\'s style. Most importantly, my largest dimension is my bust, not my hips. Women\'s tees that fit my bust have a heck of a lot of material at the hip to accommodate a ""curvy"" build, which in most women includes generous hips, thighs, and butt. I have an athletic build. My natural bust has the kind of shape most women only get with a minimizer bra, so although I\'m about a 38D/40C depending on the brand of bra, when I buy men\'s tees, I\'m very happy with a L. In most brands of tees, the men\'s tee falls nicely from my bust area and the tail doesn\'t cling to my hips or backside at all. In fact, I\'ve been known to tuck the tee into my Gildan men\'s boxer briefs. After all, women\'s underwear tends to be scratchy, cheap, and made with the assumption that one\'s waist is 10"" to 12"" smaller than one\'s hips. While once true in my case, I\'m in my 70s, and women\'s clothing manufacturers refuse to recognize certain facts of life. I generally wear pants, jeans, or joggers, which suit both my personal preferences and build and work well with men\'s boxer briefs and tees. I\'ve also discovered that when I want a tee to wear as a tunic, I can buy size LT and wear it ""tail out"", since I\'m relatively short. (BTW, the size L in boxer briefs fit me very well. I still have 36"" hips, but my lower abdomen isn\'t quite as flat as it used to be, and my waist isn\'t 25"" anymore. Women\'s bodies alter as they age due to hormonal changes, you know, just as men tend to lose muscle mass, their butts get flatter, and their tummies get the ""father figure"".) Now you probably know more than you want to regarding the fit issues for underwear and that sort of thing, but maybe all this will help a puzzled few.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States July 14, 2023', 'is_verified': True}]"

It\'s one thing when they are too big, because I can easily alter them to fit. It\'s harder to expand clothing that is too small. This shirt is BOTH too big and too small.Note: I have laundered it in cold water and machine-dried it on low heat, as the label recommends, but it shrank. I think the sleeves lost at least 2 inches.I will keep this shirt because the material is quite nice: soft stretchy knit cotton that is substantial but not overly heavy, the pattern is very cute (charcoal-colored rough lines like chalk marks on a black background), the sleeves are flexible enough for me to push up to my elbows, and the Too-Big aspect of it means that I can make easy alterations to make this shirt fit me in the body.I fully expected that it might be far too large for me in every way, since I would normally wear a Men\'s Small or Extra-Small, in which case my man would get a surprise new shirt. But I didn\'t expect that the sleeves would be like a 3/4 sleeve for him (6\'3"" typically a Men\'s Medium), but that they would be too short by a few inches for me as well.The body is quite long, as expected for a men\'s shirt. My man could wear this length. But I prefer shirts that just skim the top of my jeans. So I will cut off the bottom of the shirt and turn it into sleeve extenders.The body is about the correct width for him, but quite large on me. The yoke is just a long for me as well. The collar fits exactly right on me, so it\'s too small for him. Given all of that, I will either leave the chest and waist loose for a relaxed fit, or I will shape it to give it a more feminine tailoring, while cutting off the five inches that I don\'t need from the bottom and sewing them to the sleeves which definitely do need them!Anyway, if you are a guy with very short arms and too much fat around your middle, or if you always wear your long sleeves pushed up to the elbow anyway, this shirt might work for you off the rack.

I have been a fan for a while now of the Boulder Creek Big & Tall heavyweight tees. But, due to a variety of factors (cost being one), I have been looking for a replacement. The Carhartt tees are that replacement! They are awesome! While they are not much cheaper, they are a few dollars cheaper, and I\'ll take any bit of savings I can get. Especially because I actually like them better than the Boulder Creek tees so far!Full disclosure, I am female, but I LOVE massively oversized tees. I want the feeling I used to get when as a little girl I used to steal my dad\'s tees. I get that feeling with these. I usually wear a XXL or 2XL Big in men\'s tee\'s. These are larger than any brand (including Boulder Creek) that I\'ve every ordered before. But they are perfect! I have my share of curves, and I hate clinging fabric. These move with me and don\'t cling. A+! The fabric is soft and heavyweight without being stiff. LOVE IT!!!My one ""con"" is that the sleeves are a little longer than I\'d like. BUT I want the tees to be oversized, and I\'m not wearing these around heavy equipment or machinery, so I don\'t see it being an issue at all. It\'s just something to note, but is barely a ""con.""Mostly, they will be used for at-home projects, helping people move, lounging, and other activities where I just need a nice comfy tee that will hold up.

The fabric is smooth and easy to wear against my skin. The sweat absorption, especially after doing some time on an elliptical machine, is every bit as good as the name brand. They are light weight enough to not be uncomfortable to wear but at the same time not so lightweight to be 'show through' (I have the darker shades of the t-shirts such as black, blue, red, green etc.).I do recommend that the t-shirts be ordered 1 size larger than normal. I would traditionally wear a size large in t-shirts in order to get a little more 'roomy' type of fit (which i prefer for gym use) but, fortunately, I ordered these t-shirts in an extra large and that extra large size is what i was looking for. Basically, an extra large in these t-shirts is the same as a large in the name brand shirts.I also found that sometimes the looseness/tight-fit of the neck collar is hit-and-miss. On some t-shirts the collar fits fits pretty much the same way that the name brand t-shirts fits but on other t-shirts the collar is larger/looser. In any case, however, none of the t-shirts have a collar that i would consider to be so loose as to unwearable to the gym or even out in public.The length of the t-shirt is good. Both in the arms (which are long enough to cover but not so long to be a problem when weight lifting) and in the length of the bottom of the t-shirt which is long enough so i can easily bend over without any worries.Granted, the overall quality of the t-shirt may not be on-par with the similar brand-name t-shirts, but for half the price these t-shirts are more than close enough to get the job done.

They're not as tight around the arms, armpits or the chest but I think that the sizes are made for folks who are smaller than myself. The reason I say this is because the waistline of the shirt doesn't hang over the waistline of my pants, meaning a shirt is a little short from the bottom end up. If they would make the shirts longer and with more variety in terms of Colors and Aesthetics, I think I'd be far more willing to buy 5 or more shirts at a time.

It has held up very well and been washed a million times and has still kept its shape. It's just a really comfortable shirt. That's what I like about it. What I don't like about it is the fact that it has this funky black tag on the front of the shirt towards the bottom. You get used to it but it took me a while. The sizing seems to be off. I always ordered medium but the last medium I ordered was enormous. I had to send it back and I ordered a small and it fit like the medium had originally if that makes any sense. It's not too thick and it's not too thin. The only reason why I order it is because of the way my body is built. If I could find something cheaper or of better quality, I would buy it.

These have perfect length - absolutely love this shirt. Bought just the one to see how it would fit, now I will be buying several more in the variety of colors that are offered.So, as I mentioned the LENGTH is pretty much perfect (yes there is some ambiguity to that and what is perfect for me may be too short/long for others). The best way to describe the length is: (1) it's NOT so long that you will be confused as a chulo or brother with the t-shirts that could be a dress. (2) It IS long enough that you do not try to figure out if it is actually a TALL or notThe THICKNESS of the material comes into question. If I were to consider myself a t-shirt guru (and I actually do) the thickness of these shirts is somewhat exaggerated. Having read the other reviews before buying I expected the shirts to be really thick and heavy. The reality is that they are a high-quality t-shirt. (high-quality t-shirt . . . is that an oxymoron?)No, it is not an under shirt; similar to the 3 pack white FOTL or Hanes. Therefore, why would you expect it to feel like one. Quite honestly, the thickness reminds me of Nautica t-shirts (of which I paid $55 for one stinking t-shirt). Long story short --> this t-shirt is thicker than a plain white under tee but is by no means any thicker than a higher quality t-shirtNow to the NECK - it is a bit snug. This shirt has become my most snug as far as neck opening goes.Hers' the problem with this - how do you subjectively explain the fit/feel? I happen to like a tighter neck (coming from someone who HATES V-neck shirts - so you know I like the neck area a little tighter than most) but this shirt does make me give the neck opening a little pull/stretch every so often. BUT, if you remember the beginning of my review I wrote that I will be buying more of the shirts. So, the snugness of the neck is not so much of a deterrent that it will stop me from buying more.I can say this, if you do not like the neck opening to be snug then you really should consider not buying this brand of shirt.All-in-all I am very pleased with the purchase of this ProClub shirt. The length is perfect and the 2XL part fits well too.

My loyalty has traditionally been with Land's End for their supima cotton tees, which strike an excellent balance between material comfort and price, despite their limited color selection and availability. My journey for a wider color range led me through an extensive list of brands, exploring supima cotton, 100% cotton, and wool/cotton blends. Next Level emerged as a standout due to its affordability, durability through countless washes without compromised stitching, and a broad color palette with comfortable crew fits. For those prioritizing value, Next Level offers compelling 100% cotton options. While I'll continue to turn to Land's End for supima cotton traditional shades, Next Level aptly fills this gap. I encountered issues with Hanes' stitching durability and Gildan's inconsistent stitching patterns.

These run large, and they're relaxed fit. That makes for a slightly baggy, but more substantial work shirt.My favorite part of these shirts is the material. It's 7oz cotton so it's thicker and feels smoother to the touch than most t-shirts (which range from 4-6oz typically). The stitching looks great for the price and the thicker material makes the pocket more usable for slightly heavier items, where other shirts will have a droopy pocket as soon as you throw a pen and a flashlight in there.There's hundreds of great brands that sell T-Shirts from $8-$15, but these seem like a great choice.

They're not as tight around the arms, armpits or the chest but I think that the sizes are made for folks who are smaller than myself. The reason I say this is because the waistline of the shirt doesn't hang over the waistline of my pants, meaning a shirt is a little short from the bottom end up. If they would make the shirts longer and with more variety in terms of Colors and Aesthetics, I think I'd be far more willing to buy 5 or more shirts at a time.

It has held up very well and been washed a million times and has still kept its shape. It's just a really comfortable shirt. That's what I like about it. What I don't like about it is the fact that it has this funky black tag on the front of the shirt towards the bottom. You get used to it but it took me a while. The sizing seems to be off. I always ordered medium but the last medium I ordered was enormous. I had to send it back and I ordered a small and it fit like the medium had originally if that makes any sense. It's not too thick and it's not too thin. The only reason why I order it is because of the way my body is built. If I could find something cheaper or of better quality, I would buy it.

(Tiny little cotton balls that pile up everywhere on the shirt) the colors do indeed fade, but who cares, it still looks good. I hardly ever gotten compliments on shirts but I did with these shirts but I didn‚Äôt get the shirts for that reason. They are very comfortable and have a great fit. Especially if you‚Äôre in the slightly athletic and up, build. Nice fit on the biceps. But not too tight, nice fit around the chest. It even accentuates your back quite well too. Look, they shirts are 20 bucks. Buy a couple colors you like, if you like them a lot, but one or two more of that same color and put them away for when they stop selling these shirts. They are worth the cons that everyone talks about.To make them last longer and keep their size. Never dry them using any heat, not even the delicate setting. I hang dry all of mine. I think air fluff dryer setting would work fine. Machine wash gentle. Even as they fade or ‚Äúpile‚Äù up, they are still a much better looking shirt than any logo or solid color tee. Buy one!

They are stylish and come in many colors (I own about 12 different colors). The ONLY thing to know about them is that they wear out quickly (like 2 seasons). I wear mine a lot (7 months out of the year they are my main t-shirt), so they get washed a lot and quickly take on the faded (burn-out) look. It\'s a nice look up to a point, and then the shirts just look threadbare. But at $20-35 per shirt (depending on when I buy them) they are still a great deal if they last only 2 years. The fabrics vary from color to color, even though you\'d think they are all made of the same stuff. For instance, the ""white"" color clearly has more cotton in the blend and will last longer. Some colors, seemingly randomly, last longer than others. But again, they ALL look great when new and I get compliments on them all the time.

They're not as tight around the arms, armpits or the chest but I think that the sizes are made for folks who are smaller than myself. The reason I say this is because the waistline of the shirt doesn't hang over the waistline of my pants, meaning a shirt is a little short from the bottom end up. If they would make the shirts longer and with more variety in terms of Colors and Aesthetics, I think I'd be far more willing to buy 5 or more shirts at a time.

It has held up very well and been washed a million times and has still kept its shape. It's just a really comfortable shirt. That's what I like about it. What I don't like about it is the fact that it has this funky black tag on the front of the shirt towards the bottom. You get used to it but it took me a while. The sizing seems to be off. I always ordered medium but the last medium I ordered was enormous. I had to send it back and I ordered a small and it fit like the medium had originally if that makes any sense.

These have perfect length - absolutely love this shirt. Bought just the one to see how it would fit, now I will be buying several more in the variety of colors that are offered.So, as I mentioned the LENGTH is pretty much perfect (yes there is some ambiguity to that and what is perfect for me may be too short/long for others). The best way to describe the length is: (1) it's NOT so long that you will be confused as a chulo or brother with the t-shirts that could be a dress. (2) It IS long enough that you do not try to figure out if it is actually a TALL or notThe THICKNESS of the material comes into question. If I were to consider myself a t-shirt guru (and I actually do) the thickness of these shirts is somewhat exaggerated. Having read the other reviews before buying I expected the shirts to be really thick and heavy. The reality is that they are a high-quality t-shirt. (high-quality t-shirt . . . is that an oxymoron?)No, it is not an under shirt; similar to the 3 pack white FOTL or Hanes. Therefore, why would you expect it to feel like one. Quite honestly, the thickness reminds me of Nautica t-shirts (of which I paid $55 for one stinking t-shirt). Long story short --> this t-shirt is thicker than a plain white under tee but is by no means any thicker than a higher quality t-shirtNow to the NECK - it is a bit snug. This shirt has become my most snug as far as neck opening goes.Hers' the problem with this - how do you subjectively explain the fit/feel? I happen to like a tighter neck (coming from someone who HATES V-neck shirts - so you know I like the neck area a little tighter than most) but this shirt does make me give the neck opening a little pull/stretch every so often. BUT, if you remember the beginning of my review I wrote that I will be buying more of the shirts. So, the snugness of the neck is not so much of a deterrent that it will stop me from buying more.I can say this, if you do not like the neck opening to be snug then you really should consider not buying this brand of shirt.All-in-all I am very pleased with the purchase of this ProClub shirt. The length is perfect and the 2XL part fits well too.

So far, they've accomplished both.KUDOS: Well made and not shrinking or changing shape in the wash/dry cycles. Color is holding true after many wash/wear cycles. In terms of their being lightweight enough to stay cool/wick moisture during this heatwave, they are excellent and I find that on hotter days, I find myself looking specifically for them in the closet to put on, choosing them over many others that are good but just a little too thick for a hot day. Cloth does a great job of wicking moisture and keeping you comfy. NOTE: If you're reading this in winter and are looking for something that's short sleeve but a tad warmer, these aren't your go-to because you'll be too cool... you'll want something thicker for that season.CONS: none thus far but if I find they don't hold up all summer, I'll be back to update this review.In short, I enjoy these T-shirts enough that I went back and bought two more of them and think you'll enjoy them, too.

The medium fit fine, as a large would be too baggy around the torso area, and the neck hole would also be too large. Medium fit good and snug. The material is toward the thin side, but not a bad thin. It\'s perfect for working out in and keeps me feeling dry and good. I washed the shirts and there wasn\'t any shrinkage, as it\'s a blend of cotton/polyester.The issue with this shirt is that the short sleeve length is WAY to short. The quality is also very inconsistent in the shirts. My arm\'s aren\'t boulders either. Just athletic with a little more muscle on. So the size of my arms isn\'t making the sleeves ride up.I purchased a pack of white, black and grey. I so far have the white and black. The white shirts have a larger neck hole than the black. The white shirt sleeves go mid-bicep on my arm. The black shirt fits much smaller. The sleeve length is about a half inch to an inch shorter than the white. New update on the steel grey, these are even smaller than the black shirts. These will remain an undershirt, as it looks like a women\'s shirt with how short the sleeves are.This now makes the black shirt sleeve length sitting ABOVE mid bicep, making it look like i have a tight fitting shirt on with super short sleeves.. Just raising my arm a little makes the sleeves ride up more - this is terrible for the gym and in general. The white was more giving, but the black was not.I put the white/black on top of each other, and it\'s very noticeable on the shortened sleeves on the black..These shirts are great other than their quality control, and the inconsistency in the colors/sizes, when ordering the same size. Two colors, both mediums, fitting very different.I know these are priced low, but come on, have some quality control on the product. The black ones will now either become sleeveless shirts for the gym or i\'ll just wear them as a strict undershirt.I will not be buying this product anymore. I wanted to order many of the colors and multiple quantities so I wouldn\'t have to worry about not having a color to wear if it were dirty. I will be looking at other options with sleeve lengths that will be at least mid bicep, or an inch or two past mid bicep. I don\'t need to wear these shirts that make me look like I got it from Baby Gap, when it\'s an Adult Medium..Steel grey medium is smaller yet, as I stated earlier, but leaving this update at the end. I would avoid these shirts unless you\'re a small slim person. If you have ANY muscle, or any athleticism to your body type, stay away.5/29/2017 UPDATE: Decided to give it another chance. I got red and blue, and the blue sleeves are much shorter than the red. Also, one black shirt I previously bought started having loose threads on the bottom, so that shirt is now garbage.

Here are some details I‚Äôd like to share with other potential buyers: The shirts I received have sewn-in tags, not screen printed labeling. The tags and packaging do not have any washing instructions. Packaging is not Hanes retail logo packaging. The fit appears to be like an outerwear t shirt, not a form fitting underwear t-shirt. I purchased size medium, I have a 40R chest measurement and wear men‚Äôs size medium in most shirts. If the t-shirts do not shrink I think I can wear them alone as an outerwear t-shirt or under another shirt without any issues. The fit seems to be not too tight and not too loose. Not a baggy fit and not a form fitting underwear t-shirt fit. The length seems long enough to tuck in pants, but not as long as underwear shirts with longer length. Sleeve length is not as long as outerwear t-shirts used to be, but also not as short as many modern shirts which have very short short sleeves. Given the packaging, tags, and lack of laundering instructions, I do question if these are indeed actually Hanes shirts or if they may be counterfeit(?). The fabric looks decent, but some of the sewing work looks less than top quality. I will wash and wear them and hope that they do not fall apart or show defects.

I am average build and arms with bigger shoulders and the sleeves end about 2 inches up from elbows. So if you like short short sleeves, then this cut might be for you. But they are not traditional, as all other Tee Shirts on me end right about the elbow/bend in my arm. I fear how they will look with a few more washes.If you are someone who cold washes and hang dries or cold dries your Tee Shirts, this is not a big issue. I don't have time or patience. The cut is still a bit odd, but overall they are very nice thick cotton and good material.In comparison, I bought some Amazon Essential 100% cotton Tees for about the same price at the same time and although the material is ever so slightly thinner, I really like the cut/sleeves and the fit for a more muscular guy like me and they fit perfect.

I did not sense the severe toxic odors that was mentioned in a review and that I've experienced with various cotton shirts over the last few years. All of the name brands such as Champion etc have changed country of manufacture often enough which would affect fabric dye choice and other chemicals used in sourced cotton, manufacture and shipping concerns.. The best you can do is purchase one of something to see if the dye and other added chemicals bothers you. This shirt is light weight cotton. Feels nice. Very nice fit. The last ten years I've noticed no shirt company has that pure scent of clean cotton anymore. In the new times of outsourced materials and manufacturing the clean smelling cotton shirts I used to purchase might be gone forever. I used to get these at Walmart but lately I don't see them as they have been replaced by lighter weight synthetic fabrics.So this might work for you. But it does have a slight chemical scent that I'm trying to ignore while I use a milled natural Orange Blossom laundry soap on them.So I'll give this shirt four stars.The laundry soap I use is powdered made by the Temecula Olive Oil Company.

They are perfect like this for me. I think the Large would have been too snug for my taste. After one year they have softened up a little. Good quality. Colors haven\'t changed and the shirt itself is in the same condition.2020: I ordered a bunch of these shirts and still have a few more to receive. Some of them look amazing. They are beautiful. Others don\'t match the picture and their lines are blurred and it makes all the difference. I think if you see one that you really like and you receive one that is disappointing, you can order another one of the same shirt to see if it\'s better, if not send them back.Here are the ones that look awesome in my opinion: Coral Reef(My favorite), Camo Swirl, Barbados, Blue Ocean. The ones that just didn\'t do it for me were: Karma and Kaleidoscope.( They looked great in the photos, but not so much in real life.) I\'m still waiting and hoping for Earth(update: Earth looks awesome!) and St. Lucia.(St. Lucia arrived, but didn\'t look like the photo and it just doesn\'t look good. In my opinion all of the ones with the Caribbean island names look great.They don\'t have Antigua in my size. I would like to get Antigua. Trinidad is a bit bright for me.If you are like me and sometimes you wear an XL and other times an L, I\'d go for the XL with these. They don\'t really shrink, but I guess it depends how loose or tight you like your shirts. It would also be good to wash it the first few times separate from clothing that could be affected by the colors running and to use some fabric softener. These are comfortable but they aren\'t super soft at first. They will take a few washes and wearing them to break them in.Overall I love these shirts and I wish they would keep coming up with different color combinations. I have mostly solid color shorts, so it\'s easy to match these with your shorts. There is bound to be a color in the shirt that matches with the shorts. If that\'s important to you.Most importantly if and when you spill some food or drink on your shirt, hopefully it won\'t be so noticeable since your shirt already has so much going on.

The fabric feels soft against the skin, offering a pleasant and breathable experience, especially during warmer weather. The V-neck adds a touch of modern style, making these shirts versatile for both casual and slightly dressier occasions.What truly impressed me was the generous length of these shirts. Often, I find that t-shirts tend to ride up, leaving me constantly readjusting. However, these Amazon Essentials shirts provided the perfect amount of length, ensuring that they comfortably sit where they should, even with a longer torso.The fact that they come in a pack of two adds tremendous value to the purchase. It's an economical way to build a reliable collection of shirts that are not only comfortable but also designed with attention to the needs of those with longer torsos.The availability of the Amazon Essentials Men's Regular-Fit Short-Sleeve V-Neck T-Shirt in Big & Tall sizes is a thoughtful touch. It reflects an understanding of diverse body types and ensures that individuals of varying sizes can enjoy the same level of comfort and style.In conclusion, these t-shirts have become my go-to choice for everyday wear.

This smaller tag is actually more noticeable as you\'re wearing the briefs because the stitching results in an abrasive edge, and it sits right on your spine so you feel it anytime you\'re sitting down. And like the other 5 tags, this little needless tag is sewn in to stay, and cannot be ripped out without damage. Most manufacturers have been making underclothing without sewn-in tags for many years, so it\'s amazing that a brand as well known and established as Lacoste is putting out men\'s briefs with not jut tags, but absolute tag overkill.

They're not as tight around the arms, armpits or the chest but I think that the sizes are made for folks who are smaller than myself. The reason I say this is because the waistline of the shirt doesn't hang over the waistline of my pants, meaning a shirt is a little short from the bottom end up. If they would make the shirts longer and with more variety in terms of Colors and Aesthetics, I think I'd be far more willing to buy 5 or more shirts at a time.

It has held up very well and been washed a million times and has still kept its shape. It's just a really comfortable shirt. That's what I like about it. What I don't like about it is the fact that it has this funky black tag on the front of the shirt towards the bottom. You get used to it but it took me a while. The sizing seems to be off. I always ordered medium but the last medium I ordered was enormous. I had to send it back and I ordered a small and it fit like the medium had originally if that makes any sense.

I\'m 6\'0"" and 170lbs, which usually means mediums are too short after a few months, and larges are too wide. I bought one shirt in each size just to compare.Medium: Fits great. I\'m not sure how well it will stand the test of time, but there is some room to allow it to shrink some without becoming an issue. It will certainly be long enough to cover everything even if it does shrink quite a bit, but maybe not comfortably. I think a medium is a great ""casual going out"" shirt.Large: Is quite a bit wider than I need, which is to be expected. After a bunch of washes it might start fitting better, but for now it\'s probably best to be an ""at-home"" shirt.Both of these shirts are very comfortable and medium thickness. They are more form-fitting than I expected, which was a pleasant surprise. The shirts are by no means truly form-fitting, but unless you order a size too large, they wont make you look like a slobby blob either.Overall I was very impressed with these shirts, and I will be ordering more very soon.-- Update Below --I\'ve had these for at least a month now. One of the shirts is holding up really well, but the other\'s stitching completely fell apart at the bottom, so now it kind of rolls up at the bottom 1/2 inch.

So far, they've accomplished both.KUDOS: Well made and not shrinking or changing shape in the wash/dry cycles. Color is holding true after many wash/wear cycles. In terms of their being lightweight enough to stay cool/wick moisture during this heatwave, they are excellent and I find that on hotter days, I find myself looking specifically for them in the closet to put on, choosing them over many others that are good but just a little too thick for a hot day. Cloth does a great job of wicking moisture and keeping you comfy. NOTE: If you're reading this in winter and are looking for something that's short sleeve but a tad warmer, these aren't your go-to because you'll be too cool... you'll want something thicker for that season.CONS: none thus far but if I find they don't hold up all summer, I'll be back to update this review.In short, I enjoy these T-shirts enough that I went back and bought two more of them and think you'll enjoy them, too.

The medium fit fine, as a large would be too baggy around the torso area, and the neck hole would also be too large. Medium fit good and snug. The material is toward the thin side, but not a bad thin. It\'s perfect for working out in and keeps me feeling dry and good. I washed the shirts and there wasn\'t any shrinkage, as it\'s a blend of cotton/polyester.The issue with this shirt is that the short sleeve length is WAY to short. The quality is also very inconsistent in the shirts. My arm\'s aren\'t boulders either. Just athletic with a little more muscle on. So the size of my arms isn\'t making the sleeves ride up.I purchased a pack of white, black and grey. I so far have the white and black. The white shirts have a larger neck hole than the black. The white shirt sleeves go mid-bicep on my arm. The black shirt fits much smaller. The sleeve length is about a half inch to an inch shorter than the white. New update on the steel grey, these are even smaller than the black shirts. These will remain an undershirt, as it looks like a women\'s shirt with how short the sleeves are.This now makes the black shirt sleeve length sitting ABOVE mid bicep, making it look like i have a tight fitting shirt on with super short sleeves.. Just raising my arm a little makes the sleeves ride up more - this is terrible for the gym and in general. The white was more giving, but the black was not.I put the white/black on top of each other, and it\'s very noticeable on the shortened sleeves on the black..These shirts are great other than their quality control, and the inconsistency in the colors/sizes, when ordering the same size. Two colors, both mediums, fitting very different.I know these are priced low, but come on, have some quality control on the product. The black ones will now either become sleeveless shirts for the gym or i\'ll just wear them as a strict undershirt.I will not be buying this product anymore. I wanted to order many of the colors and multiple quantities so I wouldn\'t have to worry about not having a color to wear if it were dirty. I will be looking at other options with sleeve lengths that will be at least mid bicep, or an inch or two past mid bicep. I don\'t need to wear these shirts that make me look like I got it from Baby Gap, when it\'s an Adult Medium..Steel grey medium is smaller yet, as I stated earlier, but leaving this update at the end. I would avoid these shirts unless you\'re a small slim person. If you have ANY muscle, or any athleticism to your body type, stay away.5/29/2017 UPDATE: Decided to give it another chance. I got red and blue, and the blue sleeves are much shorter than the red. Also, one black shirt I previously bought started having loose threads on the bottom, so that shirt is now garbage.

Here are some details I‚Äôd like to share with other potential buyers: The shirts I received have sewn-in tags, not screen printed labeling. The tags and packaging do not have any washing instructions. Packaging is not Hanes retail logo packaging. The fit appears to be like an outerwear t shirt, not a form fitting underwear t-shirt. I purchased size medium, I have a 40R chest measurement and wear men‚Äôs size medium in most shirts. If the t-shirts do not shrink I think I can wear them alone as an outerwear t-shirt or under another shirt without any issues. The fit seems to be not too tight and not too loose. Not a baggy fit and not a form fitting underwear t-shirt fit. The length seems long enough to tuck in pants, but not as long as underwear shirts with longer length. Sleeve length is not as long as outerwear t-shirts used to be, but also not as short as many modern shirts which have very short short sleeves. Given the packaging, tags, and lack of laundering instructions, I do question if these are indeed actually Hanes shirts or if they may be counterfeit(?).

For working out in particular, I prefer a shirt that fits tight enough to be a bit of a struggle to get in and out of so there\'s never any bunching up or blousing of fabric getting in my way (not to mention I have the body to carry off a skin tight shirt, which at 50 years old I don\'t mind flaunting a little). So I got these in small, and for me at 5\'8"", 165 pounds, relatively thick chest and arms v. narrow waist the fit\'s just as a like it. In addition to the fit, the extra thickness of these shirts is really nice. It helps reduce any chaffing in my shoulders/upper back from doing low bar squats, cushions the bar a little better on front squats, and I feel like they help me get a better grip and lower risk of slipping in my should blades when leg driving during bench press.So great fit, great functionality, look good, plus -- as is the norm with Gildan -- really nice price for such high quality.

I ordered short sleeve ones for mountain biking and wanted long sleeves to protect me from poison ivy and briars. I am 6‚Äô2‚Äù and 260 pounds. I have larger shoulders and a larger chest with long arms. My stomach is equal to or a little smaller than my chest so the shirts hang off my chest and not on my stomach. The shirt does hang a little longer which I like because of riding. I like loose fitting clothes to help keep me cool and keep the dampness away from me as much as possible. I ordered 3x even though I wear 2x from local stores. This shirt was equal to the 2x size. I have gotten different sizes though. They always read 3x some are a little smaller and a some are a little bigger. This shirt feels good and the sleeves are good for me at a little longer. When I stand tall or ride and put my arms out my shoulders tend to pull the sleeves up my arms. That doesn‚Äôt happen on this shirt.The shirts themselves are good quality for me. This shirt I have not owned long enough for a true test but the short sleeve version I have owned for a year now and they withstand the briars and snags on the trail. They have also made it through several wrecks and I still do not have any snags in the material. They have been washed quite a bit with no color loss and they still feel good. It is interesting that I wear them in 90 degree weather for several hours and they wick moisture nicely and they do not cause me to overheat. I also wear them in the fall, and they keep me fairly warm while I am riding. I wear them through 3 seasons, and they feel good across a lot of weather conditions. In and out of rain they dry quickly just like sweating in them.I will most likely order this shirt again because I only have 1. I have not found any issues that I feel take away from the shirt.

I'm a plumber, and these are more comfortable than cotton T shirts, and I haven't had any problem with them snagging any worse than cotton.

They aren't noticeably cooler (keep in mind I'm comparing these brand new to my old T shirts that have been worn thin) until you feel a slight breeze.

They're not as tight around the arms, armpits or the chest but I think that the sizes are made for folks who are smaller than myself. The reason I say this is because the waistline of the shirt doesn't hang over the waistline of my pants, meaning a shirt is a little short from the bottom end up. If they would make the shirts longer and with more variety in terms of Colors and Aesthetics, I think I'd be far more willing to buy 5 or more shirts at a time.

It has held up very well and been washed a million times and has still kept its shape. It's just a really comfortable shirt. That's what I like about it. What I don't like about it is the fact that it has this funky black tag on the front of the shirt towards the bottom. You get used to it but it took me a while. The sizing seems to be off. I always ordered medium but the last medium I ordered was enormous. I had to send it back and I ordered a small and it fit like the medium had originally if that makes any sense. It's not too thick and it's not too thin. The only reason why I order it is because of the way my body is built. If I could find something cheaper or of better quality, I would buy it.

I got the three t-shirt bundles and only tried the black one. I can't wait to wash them to see if they shrink or not, then decide if my next purchase will be an X-Large or maybe a Large if I want a tighter look.Overall, I have now become a fan of the product and the company.

They would be great for a landscape company or anyone in construction. Cant say enough good things about these pollos. I get large pretty much for all my shirts and this large is perfect. I also like that they are just a tad longer then normal, which I really like because it‚Äôs stays tucked in when reaching or crawling. But also looks good untucked, and stays in place when wearing a tool belt.

I also love the quality construction.I expected this shirt to shrink in the laundry, so I ordered a size with room to shrink, and it has shrunken down to the perfect size for me.The only thing that bugs me is the sleeve design. It's great for people who never have to raise their arms (or even reach forward) all day long. But for those of us who are more active, the sleeves are restrictive of upward arm movement, and it feels like the whole shirt is restricting my ability to reach upward. This is because they're sewn into the body of the shirt at a downward angle. On my older tee shirts, the sleeves are sewn into the body of the shirt at a right angle, and upward arm movement is completely effortless in those shirts.

Here's my breakdown of the product:Comfort and Fit: The tee fits exceptionally well. It's true to size and offers great mobility, which is crucial for my daily runs. The fabric is soft and breathable, making it comfortable for long wear, especially during intense workouts or hot days.Performance: In terms of performance, this tee lives up to the adidas reputation. It wicks away sweat efficiently, keeping me dry and comfortable throughout my runs. The material also seems durable and has held up well after several washes without any sign of wear or tear.Design and Style: The design is sleek and modern. I appreciate the minimalistic branding and the cut of the tee, which is flattering yet functional. It's versatile enough to be worn for workouts or as casual wear.Color Issue: However, there's a slight issue with the color representation. I ordered this tee expecting a vibrant red, as shown in the product images, but the tee I received is more of an orange hue. While it's still an attractive color, it wasn't what I was expecting, which was a bit disappointing.Value for Money: Despite the color discrepancy, the tee is a good value for money. It's well-constructed, performs excellently during physical activities, and has the quality assurance of the adidas brand.Overall, I'm giving the adidas Men's Own The Run Tee a solid 4 stars. It's an excellent performance tee with all the right features for active wear. However, be mindful of the color variation if you're particular about that aspect. I'd recommend it for anyone looking for a high-quality running tee, but with a note of caution regarding the color."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States November 17, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Good', 'author': 'Sixto Trivino', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Good', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 8, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '1.0 out of 5 stars Poor workmanship on my shirt', 'author': 'C.

Feels very high end and its light and breathable as well. I normally dont like thin shirts but these do it right. Its light and flowy but not see-through.The only problem I could find with these was that the shoulders seen to have a weird pointy bit where the sleave and shirt join. Seems like a weird shirt shape/form oversight, but its subtle and once youve been wear it a bit they dont seem so annoying.All in all, at about $10 a shirt, this is probably the best bang for the buck youll get on shirts that are higher quality and fashion-forward.

This is one of the only shirts I've found that resists wrinkles, shrinking, fading, and pilling. I don't understand why so many people prefer 100% percent cotton over poly blends. Yes, these are a bit thin, but that isn't a problem for me as I always wear undershirts anyway. In fact, I prefer it that way. The one minor downside is that if the lighter colors (like my 'army green' one from the 3 pack) might show water stains if you get rained on, spill water, or sweat. My ONLY nitpick is that I wish the collar on the size 2x (which is what I bought) was tighter/had a smaller neck opening or whatever. Otherwise, they maintain their length (which is longer than most tees making them perfect for 6ft plus people like myself) and the curved hem and 'X' stitching gives them both a premium and casual look. I'm likely going to donate my other 40-something solid black tees I've acquired over the years and buy more of these. At just over 13 bucks per shirt in the 3 pack (plus there's usually a coupon available so they're cheaper than that) makes these a solid investment for me, especially considering well they've held up even in the dryer (tumble on low heat)."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States January 29, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great quality', 'author': 'James', 'rating': 5, 'content': 'Very soft , true to size.', 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States February 15, 2024', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great Shirts!', 'author': 'Donna Gallardo', 'rating': 5, 'content': ""I needed some black shirts for work that wouldn't shrink.

They're not as tight around the arms, armpits or the chest but I think that the sizes are made for folks who are smaller than myself. The reason I say this is because the waistline of the shirt doesn't hang over the waistline of my pants, meaning a shirt is a little short from the bottom end up. If they would make the shirts longer and with more variety in terms of Colors and Aesthetics, I think I'd be far more willing to buy 5 or more shirts at a time.

It has held up very well and been washed a million times and has still kept its shape. It's just a really comfortable shirt. That's what I like about it. What I don't like about it is the fact that it has this funky black tag on the front of the shirt towards the bottom. You get used to it but it took me a while. The sizing seems to be off. I always ordered medium but the last medium I ordered was enormous. I had to send it back and I ordered a small and it fit like the medium had originally if that makes any sense.

Though true-to fit, you may want to opt for a size up, e.g. if shirts you find with are a mix of, say, Large and XL, then choose XL.

I have purchased several of these shirts and they have greatly exceeded my expectations for comfort and value and effectiveness. They are extremely comfortable, and perhaps the most comfortable long sleeve shirt I have ever worn, when I consider their utility and how many hours I have worn them. They are surprisingly more comfortable than an ""old cotton t-shirt"" which seems to be everyone\'s standard for comfort. They function very well for moisture movement (wicking) and when I walk outside in hot 100 degree Texas summer weather I feel the evaporation of the sweat (keeping me cool) and my skin under the fabric remains dry. Amazing effectiveness for wicking. Wearing a typical cotton t-shirt in the same weather was a very ""wet, clingy, sticky, smelly"" feel in comparison. I wear them outside for three reasons: 1. Sun Protection (less need for wearing sunblock) 2. Visibility for Safety (the lime/yellow ANSI is very effective for hi-vis during dusk or early morning walks or when sailing) 3. Comfort (wicking keeps me cooler than old cotton t-shirts. I am a long-distance ocean sailor and also wear the hi-vis yellow shirts when sailing offshore, just in case of MOB (Man Over Board) where visibility is a matter of life and death if you are in the water. I will also wear these when snorkeling, again for sun protection (about 40-50 UPF) and for visibility when on the water surface. The shirts wash and dry very easily and quickly. Just a few minutes in a low temp dryer or breeze is enough. After several washings, the hi-vis yellow color does lose some of it\'s fluorescent quality, but the shirts retain their hi-vis yellow color. Unlike polypropylene base layer shirts, these shirts do not retain body odors or stink after washing. I find these shirts so comfortable, that I wear them either as an undergarment base layer (under other shirts or fleece in cold weather) or as a top layer in hot summer sun. They have a very nice ""silky"" fabric, that is unlike the popular but heavier and coarser texture ""waffle weave"" often seen on ANSI Hi-Vis shirts designed for outerwear. This Hanes fabric is very light weight (very much like silk) and hardly noticeable when worn. It has also proven durable, after many long days of wear and multiple washings. I am 6\' tall 240# 47"" chest and the Extra Large fits me, but is snug around my arms and chest.. I also bought the XXL size and it is much more comfortable, fitting looser, with no binding. I prefer it for comfort and do not consider it too large for me. Because these shirts are so ""silky"" and because they wick moisture, I also wear them as a sleep garment, and I highly recommend you try that too (rather than a typical pajama top). They ""slide"" with you in bed and it will feel like you are sleeping on silk sheets, very comfortable in either warm or cool or cold bedroom environment. I wake up with dry skin, (as the body moisture has been wicked away) and that is very comfortable way to sleep. I think these shirts would be a very good item for anyone who is active outdoors in hot or cold weather (e.g. Hikers, backpackers, runners, cyclists, hunters, sailors, road workers, construction crew, farmers, etc.). While the price is low, I consider the value of these shirts to be outstanding. Highly recommended! By the way, I have no connection to Hanes or the seller, and I have not been compensated or given a discount for this review.

They're slightly thick with a velvety soft cotton feel and they have a bit of a stretch to them so that the necks do not get worn and stretched out like my other t-shirt brands do. They have a $29.50 price tag attached on mine but after a $5 coupon and taxes it cost me about $30.50 and is well worth it."", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States November 8, 2023', 'is_verified': True}]"

I don't understand why they call these big and tall sizes when they are no longer than a regular tee shirt! So I had to send them back and I got the 4xlts and I purchased 4 of them! Well the first oneI tried on was no bigger than than 3xlts! However it must have been a fluke because the next 3 fit me good. So I love Puma sneakers and I like to wear Puma shirts and even Puma shorts if I can get them at a reasonable price. I bought 4 pairs of the Puma triple sneakers because I liked the first pair of red ones so much and the price was only around $50 per pair and even less. If you buy these and you are big and tall, I suggest you get a size larger than you actually wear and make sure you get the xlr size on the size chart and cross your fingers. lol"", 'timestamp': 'Reviewed in the United States July 16, 2023', 'is_verified': True}, {'title': '3.0 out of 5 stars Length', 'author': 'jody h nelson', 'rating': 3, 'content': 'For being a big and tall sized shirt, the length is not as long as I expected it to be.
